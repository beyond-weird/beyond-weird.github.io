 Pro l ogu e. 
 HE Wisdom of the Lord is an inexhaustible fountain, neither hath there
 ever been a man born who could penetrate its veritable origin and
7 foundation. The Sages and Holy Fathers have drunk long draughts
thereof, and have been fully satisWed therewith. But with all this, not one
among them hath been able to comprehend or know the Radical Principles,
because the Creator of all things reserveth that unto Himself; and, like a
jealous God, He hath indeed wished that we should enjoy the fruit thereof,
but He hath not wished to permit us to touch either the Tree or its Root. It is
then not only proper, but further also we are compelled to conform ourselves
unto the Will of the Lord, walking in that Path, by the which also our
predecessors went, without seeking out through a vain curiosity how it is that
God reigneth and governeth in His Divine Wisdom; because such would be a
very great presumption and a bestial conceit. Let us then content ourselves
with only knowing how many blessings He hath granted unto us Sinners, and
what extent of power He hath given unto us mortals over all things, and in
what way it is permitted unto us to use them. Let us then content ourselves
with this, laying aside all other, curiosity, observing without any comment that
which shall be set down in this Book wWdith elity. And if ye do follow my
 1
advice, ye shall be infallibly comforted thereby.

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 TH E FI RS T CH APT ER . 
 w hat a n d ho w ma n y be t h e for m s of v eri ta bl e ma gi c. 
 HOSO should wish to recount all the Arts and Operations which in 
 our times be reputed and preached abroad as Wisdom and Magical 
: Secrets; he should as well undertake to count the waves and the 
sands of the Sea; seeing that the matter hath co me to such a pass that every 
trick of a buVoon is believed to be Magic, that all the abominations of impious 
Enchanters, all Diabolical Illusions, all Pagan Idolatries, all Superstitions, 
Fascinations, Diabolical Pacts, and lastly all that the gross blindness of the 
World can touch with its bands and feet is reckoned as Wisdom and Magic! 
The Physician, the Astrologer, the Enchanter, the Sorceress, the Idolater, and 
the Sacrilegious, is called of the common People a Magician! Also he who 
draweth his Magic whether from the Sun, whether from the Moon, whether 
from the Evil Spirits, whether from Stones, Herbs, Animals, Brutes, or lastly 
from thousand divers sources, so that the Heaven itself is astonished thereat. 
There be certain who draw their Magic from Air, from Earth, from Fire, from 
Water, from Physiognomy, from the Hand, from Mirrors, from Glasses, from 
Birds, from Bread, from Wine, and even from the very excrements themselves; 
and yet, however, all this is reputed as Science! 
 I exhort you, ye w ho r ead, t o have t he Fear o f God, and t o s tudy Justice, 
because infallibly unto you shall be opened the Gate of the True Wisdom 
which God gave untNoo ah and unto his descendants Japhet, Abraham, and 
Ishmael; and it was His Wisdom that deliverLoed t from the burning of 
Sodom. Moses learned the same Wisdom in the desert, from the Burning 
Bush, and he taught it untoAa ron his brother.J oseph, Samuel, David, 
Solomon, Elijah , and the Apostles, and Saint John particularly (from whom 
 2 
we hold a most excellent book of Prop) pohecy ssessed it. Let every one then 
know that this, this which I teach, is that same Wisdom and Magic, and which 
is in this same Book, and independent of any other Science, or Wisdom, or 
Magic, soever. It is, however, certainly true that these miraculous operations 
have much in common with the Qabalah; it is also true that there be other 
Arts which have some stamp of Wisdom; the which alone would be nothing 
worth were they not mingled with the foundation of the Sacred Ministry, 
whence later arose the Mixed Qabalah. The Arts are principally twelve. Four in 
number,3 , 5, 7, 9, among the numbers in the Mixed Qabalah. The second is 
the most perfect one, the which operateth by Sign and Visions. Two of the 
even numbers, namely 6 and 2, which operate with the Stars and the Celestial 
Courses which we call Astronomy. Three consisteth in the Metals, and 2 in the 
 3 
Planets. As to all these Arts, the which be conjoined and mingled together 
 43

 The Sacred Magic 
with the Sacred Qabalah; both he who maketh use of these same, either alone, 
or mingled with other things which be in no way from the Qabalah; and he 
who seeketh to exercise himself in performing operations with these Arts; is 
alike liable to be deceived by the Demon; seeing that of themselves they 
possess no other virtue than a natural property; and they can produce no other 
 4 
thing than probable eVects, and they have absolutely no power in spiritual and 
 5 
supernatural things; but if, however, on certain occasion cas they use you to
behold any extraordinaryV eect, such is only produced by impious and 
diabolical Pacts and Conjurations, the which form of Science ought to be 
called Sorcery. 
 Finally, let us conclude that from the Divine Mystery are derived these 
three kinds of Qabalah, viz.: the Mixed Qabalah, and the True Wisdom, and 
the (True) Magic. We will, therefore, show forth this last, and the manner of 
becoming its possessors in the Name of God and of His Celestial Court!

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 TH E S ECO N D CH A P T ER. 
 wh at we s houl d c on si d er b ef or e un de rta k in g t hi s 
 op er ation . 
 6 7 
 E have already said what is the Science which I am to teach you, 
 that is to say, that it is neither in any way human nor diabolical, but 
: (that it is) the True and Divine Wisdom and Magic, which has been 
handed down by our predecessors unto their successors as a hereditary 
treasure. In like manner as I myself at present, so even should ye think, before 
 8 
entering into this matter and bef, ore taking possession of so great a treasure, 
how much this Gift is sublime and precious, and how vile and base are ye 
yourselves who be about to receive it. This is wherefore I say unto ye that the 
beginning of this Wisdom is the Fear of God and of justice. These be the 
Tables of the Law, the Qabalah, and the Magic; they should serve unto ye for a 
rule. It is necessary that ye should begin to attach yourselves unto the very 
beginning, if ye truly do wish to have the Veritable Wisdom; and thus shall ye 
walk in the right Path, and be able to work; all the w hich is contained in this 
Book, and all the which is therein prescribed. For to undertake this Operation 
with the simple intention of using it unto dishonest, impious, and wicked 
ends, is neither just nor reasonable; for i t is absolutely necessar y to perform 
this Operation unto the praise, honour, and glory of God; unto the use, 
health, and well-being of your neighbour, whether friend or enemy; and 
generally for that of the whole earth. Furthermore, it is also necessar y to take 
into consideration other matters, which though less important be still 
necessary; namely, whether ye be capable, not ocommencinnly of g, but also of
carrying through the Operation unto its ethis being a necessarnd; y point to
consider before coming unto a Wnal determination upon the matter; because in 
this case we are not negotiating with men, but with God, by the 
intermediation of His Holy Angels, and with all Spirits, both good and evil. 
 I am not here intending to play the Saint and Hypocrite, but it is 
necessary to have a true and loyal heart. Ye have here to do with the Lord, 
Who not only beholdeth the outer man, but Who also penetrateth the inmost 
recesses of the heart. But having taken a trWrmue, and determined r, esolution,
relying upon the Will of the Lord, ye shall arrive at your desired end, and shall 
encounter no diY culty. Often also man is changeable, and while beginning a 
thing well, Wnisheth it badly, being in no waWrm and sy table in resolution.
Ponder the matter then well before commencing, and only begin this 
Operation with the Wrm intention of carrying it out unto the end, for no man 
can make a mock of the Lord with impunity. 
 45



--------------------------------------- 8

 The Sacred Magic 
 Furtherm ore it is likewise necessary to think and consider whether your
goods and revenue be sY cient u for this matter; and, further, whether if your
quality or estate be subject unto others, ye may have time and convenience to
undertake it; also whether wife or children may hinder you herein; these being
all matters worthy of observation, so as not to commence the matter blindly.
 The chief thing that ye should co nsider is whether ye be in good health,
because the body being feeble and unhealthy, it is subject to divWrmiers ties,in
whence at length result impatience and want of power to operate and pursue
the Operation; and a sick man can neither be clean and pure, nor enjoy
solitude; and in such a case it is better to cease. 
 Consider then the safety of your person, commencing this Operation in a
place of safety, whence neither enemies nor any disgrace can drive you out
before the end because ye mustWnish wher e ye begin.
 But the Wrst part of this chapter is the most important, and see that ye
keep well in mind the necessity of observing the same, because as regardeth the
other disadvantages, they may perhaps be remedied. And be ye sure that God
doth aid all those who put their coWdennce in Him and in His Wisdom, and
such as wish to live rightly, making use with honour of the deceitful world,
which ye shall hold in abomination, and see that ye make no account of its
opinion when ye shall be arrived at the perfection of the work, and that ye
shall be possessors of this Sacred Magic.

 N order to describe the aforesaid and other considerations in the best 
 possible manner; I will here make a general recapitulation; mentioning also 
, Wrst what may bring hindrance unto the matter. 
 9 
 It is, then, necessar y that such a man give himself up unto a tranquil life, 
and that his habits be temperate; that he should love retirement; that he 
should be given neither u nto avarice nor usury (that he should be the 
legitimate child o f his parents is a good thing, but not as necessary as for the 
 10 
Qabalah, unto which no man born of a clandestine marriage can attain); his 
age ought not to be less than twentyWve y- ears nor more than Wfty; he should 
have no hereditary disease, such as virulent leprosy; whether he be free or 
married importeth little; a valet, lackey, or other domestic servant, can with 
diY culty arrive at the end required, being bound unto others and not having 
the conveniences at disposal which are necessary, and which this O peration 
 11
demandeth. Among women, there be only Virgins who are suitable; but I 
strongly advise that so important a matter sh ould not be communicated to 
them, because of the accidents that they might cause by their curiosity and 
love of talk.

 The Sacred Magic 
 TH E FO U RTH CH A PT E R. 
 th at the gr ea t er number of ma gi ca l bo oks ar e f a lse a nd 
 va i n . 
 LL the Books which treat of Characters, Extravagant Figures, Circles, 
 Convocations, Conjurations, Invocations, and other like matters, even 
$ although any one may see some eVect thereby, should be rejected, being 
 12 
works full of Diabolical Inve ntions; and ye should know that the Demon 
maketh use of an inWnitude of methods to entrap and deceive mankind. This I 
have myself proved, be cause when I have operated with the Veritable Wisdom, 
all the other enchantments which I had learned have ceased, and I could no 
longer operate with them, and I made a v ery careful trial of those which I had 
learned with the Rabbin Moses; the cause of which is that the deceit and 
fraud of the Demon can never appear where the Divine Wisdom is. 
Furtherm ore, the most certain mark of their falsity is the election of certain 
days; since there be those which God hath expressly commanded to sanctify, 
we can freely operate on all other days, and at all times. And whenever ye shall 
see tables which do mark the days and their Verences, the di Celestial Signs,
 13 
and other like matters, pay no attention thereto, because herein is a very great 
 14 
sin hidden, and a deceit o f the Demon; it being one of his many methods of 
endeavouring to confound the True Wisdom of the Lord with evil matters. 
Because this True Wisdom of the Lord can operate and perform its eVects 
every day, and at any moment and second. The Gates of His Grace are daily 
open, He wisheth, and it is pleasing unto Him to aid us, as well on this day as 
on the morrow; and in no way could it be true that He desireth to be 
subjected to the day and hour which men would wish to prescribe for Him; 
seeing that He is the Master to elect such days as He Himself wisheth, and also 
may they be sanctiWed! Flee also all such Books as those whose Conjurations 
 15 
include extravagant, inexplicable, and unheard-of wo and wrds, hich be
impossible to understand, and which be truly the inventions of the Devil and 
of wicked men. 
 It is well also to recall that which I have said in the First Book, viz., that in 
the greater part of their Conjurations there was not the slightest mention made 
of God Almighty, but only of Invocations of the Devil, together with very 
obscure Chaldean words. Surely it would be a rash thing of a man w ho should 
deal with God by the intermediary of His Holy Angels, to think that he ought 
to address Him in a jargon, neither knowing what he saith nor what he 
demandeth. Is it not an act of madness to wish Vento d Goo d and His Holy
Angels! Let us then walk in the right way, let us speak before God with heart 
 16 
and mouth alike opened, in our own maternal langu since hoage, w can ye
48 



--------------------------------------- 11

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
pretend to obtain any Grace from the Lord, if ye yourselves know not what ye 
ask? Yet, however, the number of those who lose themselves utterly in this 
vanity is inWnite; many say that the Grecian language is more agreeable unto 
God, it may be true that it was perhaps at one time, but how many among us 
to-day understand it perfectly, this is the reason why it would be the most 
senseless thing to employ it. 
 I repeat then:– Let each one speak his own language, because thus 
understanding what it is that ye are demanding of the Lord, ye will obtain all 
Grace. And if ye demand a thing which is unjust, it will be refused unto you, 
and ye will never obtain it.

 TH E FIF T H CH A P TE R . 
 tha t in thi s op era ti on it is n ot n e ces sar y t o r egar d th e

 HERE be no other days (to be observed) than those which God hath 
 ordained unto our Fathers, viz., All Saturdays, which be the days of the
7 Sabbath; Passover; and the of Tabernacles; of which the former is the
Fifteenth Day of the First of our Months, and the latter (beginneth on) the 
 17 
Fifteenth Day of the Seventh Month. Now for this Operation, any person of
 18 
whatever Law he may be, prov ided that he confesseth that there is One
 19 
God, may observe these feasts. However, the true time of commencing this
Operation is the Wrst day after the Celebration of the Feasts of Easter, and this
was ordained unto Noah, being the most convenient time, and the end falleth 
 20 
just at the (Feast of ) Tabernacles. Our predecessors have thus observed it, and
 21 
the Angel also hath approved it; and also it is more advisable to follow good
counsel and example, than to be obstinate and follow one's own caprice; and 
also to treat the election of a particular day as a Pagan idea, paying no regard.
whatever either to Time nor to the Elements; but only (having respect) unto 
Him Who granteth such a period. Thus then will we be found men in the 
Wttest condition of Grace and reconciled with God, and purer than at another
period; and this being an essential po int ye ought well to consider the same.
 It is, however, quite true that the Elements and the Constellations do
 22 
perform of themselves certain operatio but this is tns o be understood of
natural things, as it happeneth that one day is diVerent unto another; but such
a diVerence hath not operation in things Spiritual and Supernatural, being 
thus useless for (higher) Magical Operations. The Election of Days is still more
useless, the Election of Hours and Minutes whereof the ignorant make so 
much, is further a very great error. 
 Wherefore I have resolved to write this particular chapter, in order that
this error might appear more plainly evident unto him who readeth it, and 
that he may draw proWt therefrom so as to operate with judgment.

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 TH E S I X T H CH APT E R . 
 con c ern in g th e pl a n et a ry ho ur s an d oth er e r ro r s of th e 
 as tro l oger s . 
 T is tr ue that the Wise in Astrology do write of the Stars and of their 
 movements, and that these attaining thereto do produce divVects iners e 
, infe rior and elemental things; and such are, as we have already said, natural 
operations of the Elements; but that they should have power over the Spirits, 
or force in all supernatural things, that is not, neither can ever be. But it will 
instead be found that by the permission of the Great God it is the Spirits who 
govern the Wrmament. What foolishness then wo uld it be to implore the 
favour of the Sun, of the Moon, and of the Stars, when the object would be to 
have converse with Angels and with Spirits. Would it not be an extravagant 
idea to demand from the wild beasts the permission to go hunting? But what 
 23 
else is it, when they have elected a certain day, when they have divided it up 
into many false divisions such as hours, minutes, etc. “Here,” they say, “we 
have the Planetary Hours, and the Planet appropriate to each Hour.” O what 
Planets! O what Wne order! Tell me, I pray you, what advantage you get by this 
division. You will reply: “A very great one, because it shows us in all things, 
either good or bad fortune!” I tell you, and I repeat absolutely, that this is in 
no way true; that they produce thus a change of the time and of the Air, I in 
part concede; but do me the grace to tell me how ye do divide the Planetary 
Hours. I know that ye begin the Wrst hour of the day with the Planet which 
itself giveth the name unto the day, as Sunday is ascribed to the Sun, Monday 
to the Moon, Tuesday to Mars, Wednesday to Mercury, Thursday to Jupiter, 
Friday to Venus, and Saturday to Saturn; then ye divide the length of the Day 
into twelve equal portions which ye call Hours, and to each Hour ye assign its 
planet; and ye do the same thing with the Night, according to whether the 
days be long or short. Thus do the Hours become long or short. As for 
example, suppose that on a Sunday the Sun riseth at 7 o'clock and setteth at 5 
o'clock in the evening, its course will be ten Hours, the which ye divide up 
into twelve equal parts, so that each Hour is of Wfty minutes length. I say, 
therefore, that the Wrst Planetary Hour is of the Sun, and is Wfty minutes long; 
that the second is of Venus; the third of Mercury; and so on of the others; at 
last the eighth Hour returneth unto the Sun; the ninth unto Venus; the tenth 
unto Mercury; and so the DaWy nisheth. Then cometh the Night, which is 
longer, that is to say, fourteen Hours, and each Planetary Hour of this Night 
will be seventy minutes, and in order to continue the regular succession as we 
have begun, the Wrst Hour of the Night will be of Jupiter; the second of Mars; 
the third of the Sun; and so on until Monday, whWorsst He our will be 
 51

 The Sacred Magic
(according to this rule) of the Moon. Now tell me, I pray you, doth it always
happen that when the Day of Monday commenceth, that is to say, when the
Sun riseth in its ho rizon, that the Moon riseth also together with him, and that
she setteth also together with him? The y cannot answer this. Wher efore then
do they apportion unto the second day of the week and untoWrst h itos ur the
Moon? They can tell you no reason, except a likeness to the name (of the
 24 
Day). 
 O! how gross an error! Hear and tell me w hen it is that a Planet hath the
greatest force in the Elements; whether when aboit is ve or when it is below
your Horizon or Hemisphere? We must however avow that it is more powerful
when it is above, because being below it hath no power save according unto
the Will of God. Why then, even further than this, should we attribute unto a
Planet a Day and Hour, if during the whole period of such Day it appeareth
not above the Horizon! 
 Abramelin as a most excellent Master in natural things taught unto me
a very diVerent form of classiWcation (which also well examine, and see
whether it be not more surely founded than the aforesaid rule of the
Astrologers), and made me to comprehend what should be the true Planetary
Hours. When the Planet beginneth to appear u pon the Horizon then dits oth 
Day begin (whether it be Light or Dark, Black or White), and until it bath
 25 
passed its elevatio n its Day lasteth until it riseth ane w, and after that it hath
set its Night endureth; so that as well in the Days of the Sun as in those of the
Moon and of the othertshe Day, s of all the Planets be minglonelyd, that one
commenceth sooner than another, according to which nature they be mingled
together in the Celestial Signs. Now it is requisite that I should tell unto you
what be the Planetary Hours! Know then that each Planet hath only an hour
during the which it is very powerful, being over you and above your head, that
is to say when it is in the Meridian. Then, naturally, will sometimes arrive the
Hours of two Planets together and beginning at the same m oment; they then
produce an eVect according unto the nature, quality, and complexion of these
 26 
stars. But all this only hath power in natu ral things. Here have I declared and
proved unto you the errors of the (common) Astrologers; keep yourselves
carefully from the insensate follies of their Days and Hours, because if ye make
use of these as do the false Magicians and Enchanters, God will chastise you;
and in order to chastise you will pay but little attention unto the awaiting of
the Hour of Saturn or of Mars. 
 I therefore now conclude this chapter, having suY ciently treated of the
false and useless method employed by the Astrologers in the Election of Days
and of Hours.

 TH E S EV E N T H CH A PTE R. 
 re gar ding wh at it is n e cessar y t o a cc omp lis h dur i ng the 
 fi rs t t wo mo on s of t h e b eginn ing o f thi s v er i tabl e an d 
 sa cr ed ma gi c. 
 E who commenceth this Operati on should consider with care that 
 which we have before said, and should pay attention unto that which 
+ followeth; and the thing being of importance, I shall leav e alone for the 
present all other considerations, so that we may begin with the Operation 
which we should perform on the Wrst morning after the celebration of the 
Feast of Easter (or Passover). 
 Firstly: Having carefully washed one's whole body and having put on 
fresh clothing: pr ecisely a quarter of an hour before Sunrise ye shall enter into 
your Oratory, open the window, and place yourselves upon your knees before 
the Altar, turning your faces towards the window; and devoutly and with 
boldness ye shall invoke the Name of the Lord, thanking Him for all the grace 
which He hath given and granted unto you from your infancy until now; then 
with humility shall ye humble yourselves unto Him, and confess unto Hirn 
entirely all your sins; supplicating Him to be willing to pardon you and remit 
them. Ye shall also supplicate Him that in the time to come He may be willing 
and pleased to regard you with pity and grant you His grace and goodness to 
send unto you His Holy Angel, who shall serve unto you as a Guide, and lead 
you ever in His Holy Way and Will; so that ye fall not into sin through 
inadvertence, through ignorance, or through human frailty. 
 In this manner shall ye commence your Oration, and continue thus every 
morning during the Wrst two Moons or Months. 
 Meseemeth here that now some may say: “Wherefore dost thou not write 
down the words or form of prayer the which I should employ, seeing that, as 
for me, I am neither suY ciently learned, n or devout, nor wise?” 
 Know ye that although in the beginning your prayer be but feeble, it will 
suY ce, provided that ye understand how to demand the Grace of the Lord 
with love and a true heart, whence it must be that such a prayer cometh forth. 
Also it serveth nothing to speak without devotion, without attention, and 
without intelligence; nor yet to pronounce it with the mouth alone, without a 
true intent; nor yet to read it as do the ignorant and the impious. But it is 
absolutely necessary that y our prayer should issue from the midst of your 
heart, because simply setting down prayers in writing, the hearing of them will 
 27 
in no way explain unto you how really to pray This is the r. eason that I have
not wished to give unto you any special form of prayers and orations, so that 
ye yourselves may learn from and of yourselves how to pray, and how to invoke 
the Holy Name of God, our Lord; and for that reason I have not been willing 
 53

 The Sacred Magic 
that ye should re ly upon me in order to pray. Ye have the Holy and Sacred
Scripture, the which is Wlled with very beautiful and potent prayers and actions
of grace. Study then herein, and learn herefrom, and ye shall have no lack of
instructions how to pray with fruit. And although in the commencement your
prayer may be weak, it Ysuceth that your heart be true and loyal towards God,
Who little by little will kindle in you His Holy Spirit, Who will so teach you
and enlighten your Spirit, that ye shall both know and have the power to pray.
 When ye shall have performed your orations, close the window, and go
forth from the Oratory; so that no one may be able therein to enter; and ye
shall not yourselves enter again until the evening when the Sun shall be set.
Then shall ye enter therein afresh, and shall perform your prayers in the same
manner as in the morning. 
 For the rest, ye shall govern yourselves each day as I shall tell y ou in the
following instructions. 
 Concerning the Bed Chamber and the O ratory, and how they should be
 28
arranged, I will tell hereafter in the Eleventh Chapter. 
 It is requisite that ye shall have a Bed Chamber near the Oratory or else
your ordinary habitation, which it is necessarWrst ty o thoroughly clean out
and perfume, and see that the Bed be both new and clean. Your whole 
attention must be given to purity in all things; becau se the Lord hath in
abomination all that is impure. You shall sleep in this said Chamber, and you
shall continue therein during the day, there transacting the matters which
belong unto your business; and those which you can dispense with, leave
alone. You may sleep with your Wife in the bed when she is pure and clean;
but when she hath her monthly courses you shall not allow her to enter the
bed, nor even the Chamber. Every Sabbatheve it is necessary to change the
sheets of the bed, and all the linen. Every Saturday you shall perfume the
Chamber. And ye shall not allow any dog, cat, or other animal to enter into
nor dwell therein; so that they ma y in no way be able to render it unclean. As
regardeth the matrimonial obligation, it is chastity, and the duty that of
engendering children; but the whole should be done in the Fear of God, and,
above all things, in such case see that your Wife be not impure. But during the
following four Moons ye shall Xee sexual intercourse as ye would the Plague.
Even if ye have children, endeavour to send them away unto another place
before (commencing the Operation), so that they may not be an hindrance
from being about you; except the eldest-born of the family, and infants at the
breast. 
 As regardeth the regimen of your life and actions, ye shall have regard
unto your status and condition. If you be your own Master, as far as lieth in
your power, free yourself from all your business, and quit all mundane and
vain company and conversation; leading a lif e tranquil, solitary and honest. If
aforetime you have been a wicked, debauched, avaricious, luxurious and proud

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
man, leave and Xee from all these Vices. Consider that this was one of the 
principal reasons why Abraham, Moses, David, Elijah, John, and other holy 
men retired into desert places, until that they had acquired this Holy Science 
and Magic; because where there are many people, many scandals do arise; and 
where scandal is, Sin cometh; the which at length Vendeth and drivo eth away
the Angel of God, and the Way which leadeth unto Wisdom becometh closed 
unto ye. Fly as far as you can the conversation of men, and especially of such 
as in the past hav e been the companions of your debauches; or who have led 
you into sin. Ye shall therefore seek retirement as far as possible; until that ye 
shall have re ceived that Grace of the Lord which ye ask. But a Domestic 
 29 
Servant who is compelled to serve a Master cannot well have these 
conveniences (for working and performing the Operation). 
 Take well heed in treating of business, in selling or buying, that it shall be 
requisite that you never give way unto anger, but be modest and patient in 
your actions. 
 You shall set apart two hours each day after having dined, during the 
which you shall read with care the Holy Scripture and other Holy Books, 
because they will teach you to be good at praying, and how to fear the Lord; 
and thus day by day shall ye better know your Creator. The other exercises 
which be free and permitted unto you, are hereafter set forth and principally in 
the Eleventh Chapter. 
 As for eating, drinking and sleeping, such should be in moderation and 
never superXuous. It is especially necessary to shun drunkenness, Xeeand 
public dinners. Content yourself with eating at your own house, with your 
family, in the peace and quiet which God hath granted unto you. You should 
never sleep during the day, but you may in the morning, for after that you 
have performed your devotions you may if you wish again go to bed to rest 
yourself. And if it happeneth by chance that you do not rise suY ciently early, 
that is to say before sunrise, it doth not greatly matter (provided that it be not 
 30
done of evil intent), and you shall perform your ordinary morning prayer; 
but you should not accustom yourself to be slothful, it being always better to 
pray unto God at an early hour. 
 conc ern ing clo t hin g an d f a m i ly. 
 Your dress should be clean but moderate, and according to custom. Flee 
all vanity. You shall have two dresses, in order that you may be able to change 
them; and you shall change them the eve of each Sabbath, wearing the one one 
week, and the other the next brushing and perfuming them always 
beforehand. 
 As for that which regardeth the family, the fewer in number, the better; 
also act so that the ser vants may be modest and tranquil. All these pieces of 
advice be principal points which it is we ll to observe. As for the rest, you have

only to keep before your eyes the Tables of the Law during all this time, and
also afterwards; because these Tables should be the rule of your life.
 Let your hand be ever ready to give alms and other Wtsbene to your
neighbour; and let your heart be ever open unto the poor, whom God so
loveth that one cannot express the same.
 And in the case that during this period you should be attacked by some
illness, which would not permit you to go unto the Oratory, this need not
oblige you to abandon your enterprise at once; but you should govern yourself
to the best of your ability; and in such case you shall perform your orations in
your bed, entreating God to restore you to health, so that you may be enabled
to continue your undertaking, and make the saWcecris which be due, and so
with the greater strength be able to work to obtain His Wisdom.
 And this is all that we should do and observe during these two Moons.

 HE two Wrst Moons being Wnished; the tw o second Moons follow, 
 during the which ye shall make your prayer, morning and evening at the 
7 hour accustomed; but before entering into the Oratory ye shall wash 
your hands and face thoroughly with pure water. And you shall prolong your 
prayer with the greatest possible Vectia on, devotion and submission; humbly 
entreating the Lord God that He would deign to command His Holy Angels 
to lead you in the True Way, and Wisdom, and Knowledge, by studying the 
which assiduously in the Sacred Writings there will arise more and more 
(Wisdom) in your heart. 
 The use of the rights of Marriage is permitted, but should scarcely if at all 
be made use of (during this peri od). 
 You shall also wash your whole body every Sabbath Eve. 
 As to what regardeth commerce and manner of living, I have already 
given unto you suY cient instruction. 
 Only it is absolutely necessary to retire from the world and seek retreat; 
and ye shall lengthen your prayers to the utmost of your ability. 
 As for eating, drinking and clothing, ye shall govern yourselves in exactly 
the same manner as in the twWros t Moons; except that ye shall fast (the 
Qabalistical fast) every Sabbath Eve. 
 Note Well: The Sabbath is for the Je ws, who are accustomed to observe 
the same every Saturday, but for Christians the Sabbath is the Sunday, and 
 31 
they ought to consider the Saturday as its Eve.

 ORNING and Noon ye shall wash your hands and your face on
 32 
 entering the Oratory; and Wrstly ye shall make Co nfession of all your
0 sins; af ter this, with a very ardent prayer, ye shall entreat the Lord to
accord unto you this particular grace, which is, that you may enjoy and be able
 33 
to endure the presence and conversation of His Holy Angels, and that He
may deign by their intermission to grant unto you the Secret Wisdom, so that
you may be able to have dominion over the Spirits and over all creatures.
 Ye shall do this same at midday before dining, and also in the evening; so
that during these two last Moons ye shall per form the prayer three times a day,
and during this time ye shall ever keep the Perfume upon the Altar. Also
towards the end of your Oration, ye shall pray unto the Holy Angels,
supplicating them to bear your sacriWce before the Face of God, in order to
intercede for you, and that they shall assist you in all your operations during
these two Moons. 
 34 
 The man who is his own master shall leave all business alone, except
works of charity towards his neighbour. You shall shun all society except that
of your Wife and of your Servants. Ye shall employ the greatest par t of your
time in speaking of the Law of God, and in reading such works as treat wisely
thereof; so that your eyes may be opened unto that which from past time even
unto the present ye have not as yet seen, nor thought of, nor believed.
 Every Sabbath Eve shall ye fast, and wash your whole body, and change
your garment. 
 Furtherm ore, ye shall have a Vest and Tunic of linen, which ye shall put
on every time that ye enter into the Oratory, before ye commence to put the
Perfume in the Censer, as I shall tell ye more fully hereafter
 Also ye shall have a basket or other convenient vessel ofW colled wpper ith
Charcoal to put inside the Censer when necessar y, and which ye can take
outside the Oratory, because the Censer itself should never be taken away from
the place. Note well that after having performed your prayer, you ought to
 35 
take it out of the Oratory, especially during the Two last Moons, and ye
should inter it in a place which cannot well be made unclean, such as a garden.

 LTHOUGH the bes t counsel which I can give is that a man should go 
 into re tirement in some desert or solitude, until the time of the Six 
$ Moons destined unto this Operation be fulWlled, and that he shall hav e 
obtained that which he wisheth; as the Ancients used to do; nevertheless now 
this is hardly possible; and we must accommodate ourselves un to the era (in 
which we live); and being unable to carry it out in one way, we should 
endeavour to do so in another; and attach ourselves only unto Divine Things. 
 But there be cer tain who cannot even do this thoroughly, notwithstanding 
they may honestly wish the same; and this because of their divers employments 
and positions which will not permit them to act in accordance with their 
desires, so that they are compelled to carry on their worldly occupations. 
 In order then that such may know what occupations and business they 
can follow out without prejudice to this Operation, I will here state the same 
in few words. 
 We may then exercise the profession of Medicine, and all arts connected 
with the same; and we may perform all operations which tend unto charity 
and mercy towards our neighbour purely and simply. As for what concerneth 
the liberal arts ye may interest yourselves in Astronomy, etc., but Xee all arts 
and operations which have the least tincture of Magic and Sorcery, seeing that 
we must not confound together God and Belial: God wisheth to be alone; 
unto Him pertain all honour and glory. All the above matters are however 
permitted during the twoWrs t and the two second Moons. 
 You may walk in a garden for recreation; but you shall do no servile work; 
and amidst the Xowers and the fruits you can also meditate upon the 
 36 
greatness of God. But during the two third and last Moons ye shall quit every 
other matter only permitting your recreation to consist in things Spiritual and 
Divine. If ye wish to be participators in the Conversation of the Angels, and in 
 37 
the Divine Wisdom, lay aside all indiscr things, and reet egard it as a pleasure 
when ye can spare two or three hours to study the Holy Scripture, because 
hencefrom ye shall derive incredible prWt; and evo en the less ye are learned, so 
much the more will ye become wise and clever. IY cet sth that in u the
performance of your Orisons ye shall not give way unto sleep, and that ye shall 
fail in nowise in this operation through negligence and voluntarily.

 E should make the Selection of the Place (for the Operation) before 
 commencing it, and prior to the celebration of the Passover, in order
: that we may decide upon the same without hindrance, and it is 
necessary that all things should be prepared. 
 He who commenceth this Operati on in solitude can elect a place 
according unto his pleasure; where there is a small wood, in the midst of which 
you shall make a small Altar, and you shall cover the same with a hut (or 
shelter) ofW ne branches, so that the rain may not fall thereon and extinguish 
the Lamp and the Censer. Around the Altar at the distance of seven paces you 
shall prepare a hedge Xoofw ers, plants, and green shrubs, so that it may divide 
 39 
the entrance into two parts; that is to say, the Interior where the Altar and
Tabernacle will be placed after the manner o f a Temple; and the part Exteri or, 
which with the rest of the place will be as a Portico thereunto. 
 Now if you commence not this Operation in the Country, but perform it 
in a Town, or in some dwellingplace, I will show unto ye what shall be 
 40 
necessary herein. 
 Ye shall choose an Apartment which hath a Window, joined unto the 
which shall be an uncovered Terrace (or Balcony), and a Lodge (or small room 
or hut) covered with a roof, but so that there may be on every side windows 
whence you may be able to see in ever y direction, and whence you may enter 
 41 
into the Oratory. In the which place the Evil Spirits shall be able to appear,
since they cannot appear w ithin the Oratory itself In the which place, beside 
the Oratory towards the quarter of the North, you shall have a rooted or 
covered Lodge, in the which and from whence one ma y be able to see the 
Oratory. I myself also had two large windows made in my Oratory, and at the 
time of the Convocation of the Spirits, I used to open them and remove both 
the shutters and the door, so that I could easily see on every side and constrain
 42 
them to obey me. 
 The Oratory should always be clear and clean swept, and the Xooring 
should be of wood, of white pine; Wne, this place shouin ld be so well and
carefully prepared, that one may judge it to be a place destined unto pra yer. 
 The Terrace and the contiguous Lodge where we are to invoke the Spirits 
we should cover with river sand to the depth of twWngers at the least.o 
 The Altar should be erected in the midst of the Oratory; and if any one 
 43 
maketh his Orator y in desert places, he should bu of sild it tones which have
never been worked or hewn, or even touched by the hammer. 
60

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 44 
 The Chamber should be boarded with pine wood, and a Lamp full of 
Oil Olive should be suspended therein, the which every time that ye shall have 
burned your perfume anWdn ished your orison, ye shall extinguish. A 
handsome Censer of bronze, or of silver if one hath the means, must be placed 
upon the Altar, the which should in no wise be removed from its place until 
the Operation be Wnished, if one performeth it in a dwelling-house; for in the 
open country one cannot do this. Thus in this point as in all the others, we 
should rule and govern ourselves according unto the means at our disposal. 
 The Altar, which should be made of wood, ought to be hollow within 
after the manner of a cupboard, wherein you shall keep all the necessary 
things, such as the two Robes, the Crown or Mitre, the Wand, the Holy Oils, 
the Girdle or Belt, the Perfume; and any other things which may be necessary. 
 45 
 The second habiliments will be a Shirt or Tunic of linen, large and 
white, with well and properly made sleeves. The other Robe will be of 
Crimson or Scarlet Silk with Gold, and it should not be longer than just unto 
the knees, with sleeves of similar stuV. As for these vestments, there is no 
particular rule for them; nor any especial instructions to be followed; but the 
more resplendent, clean, and brilliant they are the better w ill it be. You shall 
also make a Girdle of Silk of the same colour as the Tunic, where withal you 
shall be girded. You shall have upon your head a beautif ul Crown or woven 
Fillet of Silk and Gold. You shall prepare the Sacred Oil in this manner: Take 
 46 47 
of myrrh in tears, one part; oWfn e cinnamon, two parts; of galangal, half a
part; and the half of the total weight of these drugs of the best oil olive. The 
which aromatics you shall mix together according unto the Art of the 
Apothecary, and shall make thereof a Balsam, the which you shall keep in a 
glass vial which you shall pu t within the cupboard (formed by the interior) of 
 48 
the Altar. The Perfume shall be made thus: Take of Incense in tears one part;
 49 
of Stacte half a part; of Lign Aloes a quarter of a part; and not being able to 
get this wood you shall take that of cedar, or of rose, or of citron, or any other 
odoriferous wood. You shall reduce all these ingredients into a vWne ery 
powder, mix them well together and keep the same in a box or other 
convenient vessel. As you will consume a great deal of this perfume, it will be 
advisable to mix enough on the eve of the Sabbath to last the whole week. 
 You shall also have a Wand of Almond-tree wood, smoo th and straight, of 
 50 
the length of about from half an ell to six Afeet nd ye shall keep the aforesaid 
 51 
things in good order in the cupboa ord f the Altar, ready for use in the proper 
time and place. 
 Here followe th the manner of ordering oneself and of operating.

 HIS Operation being truly Divine, it is necessary once more to treat of 
 and distinguish the present Consecration into diVerent periods of time. 
7 You shall then understand that during the twoWrst and tw o second
Moons, no other Consecration must be performed, than that of which we have 
 52 
already spoken in the Seventh and Eighth foregoing Chapters, unto the
which I refer you, so as not to be too prolix. And I only say unto you, that 
during the course of the twWrso t and two second Moons, every Saturday when 
ye perform the Orison, ye shall also burn the Perfume as well in the morning 
as in the evening; and in the two third and last Moons ye shall make the Prayer 
and the Perfume thrice daily. 
 Now here hath the last part of the time arrived here therefore open ye 
your eyes and be attentive, and govern yourselves in everything and every place 
in the way which I have written unto you. Have Wdeconce in Gon d, because if
even until then ye have faithfully observed mine instructions which I have 
given unto you, and if your Orisons shall have been made with a righteous 
heart and with devotion, there is no manner of doubt that all things will 
appear easy unto you, and your own spirit and your understanding will teach 
you the manner in which you shou ld conduct yourself in all points; because 
your Guardian Angel is already about you, though Invisible, and conducteth 
and governeth your heart, so that you shall not err. The two Moons being 
Wnished, in the morning ye shall commence all that is commanded in the 
 53 
Ninth Chapter, and further observe this present Chapter. 
 When Wrst ye shall enter into the Oratory, leave your shoes without, and 
 54 
having opened the windo wy, e shall place the lighted coals in the Censer 
 55 
which you shall have brought with you, you shall light the Lamp, and take 
from the Cupboard of the Altar your two Vestments, the Crown, the Girdle 
and the Wand, placing them upon the Altar. Then take the Sacred Oil in your 
left hand, cast some of the Perfume upon the Fire , and place yourself upon

know my wretchedness, and that I am not worthy to appear before Thy 
Divine Majesty, nor even to implore and beseech Thy Goodness and Mercy 
for the least Grace. But, O Lord of Lords, the Source of Thy Bounty is so 
great, that of Itself It calleth those who are ashamed by reason of their sins and 
dare not approach, and inviteth them to drink of Thy Grace. Wherefore, O 
Lord my God, have pity upon me, and take away from me all iniquity and 
malice; cleanse my soul from all the uncleanness of sin; renew within me my 
Spirit, and comfort it, so that it ma y become strong and able to comprehend 
the Mystery of Thy Grace, and the Treasures of Thy Divine Wisdom. Sanctify 
me also with the Oil of Thy SanctiWcation, wherewith Thou hast sanctiWed all 
Thy Prophets; and purify in me therewith all that apper taineth unto me, so 
that I may become worthy of the Conversation of Thy Holy Angels and of 
Thy Divine Wisdom, and grant unto me the Power which Thou hast given 
unto Thy Prophets over all the Evil Spirits. Amen. Amen.” 
 This is the Prayer which I myself made use of in my Consecration; the 
which I give not here to coWne yn ou (to a certain form), nor to oblige you to 
employ the same, nor to tell it you over as I would to a parrot whom I should 
wish to teach to talk; but only and solely to give unto you an idea of the 
manner in which we should pray. 
 Having Wnished your Orison, rise from your knees, and anoint the 
 57 
centre of your forehead with a little of the Sacred Oil; after this dip your 
Wnger into the same Oil, and anoint therewith the four upper corners of the 
Altar. Touch also with this Holy Oil the Vestments, the Girdle, the Crown, 
and the Wand, on both sides. You shall also touch the Doors and the Windows 
of the Oratory. Then with your Wnger dipped in the Oil you shall write upon 
the four sides of the Altar these words, so that they may be per fectly clearly 
written on each side:– 
 “In whatever place it may be wherein Commemoration of My Name shall 
be made, I will come unto you and I will bless you.” 
 This being done the ConsecrationW is nished, and then ye shall put the 
White Tunic and all the other things into the Cupboard of the Altar. Then 
kneel down and make your ordinary prayer, as is laid down in the Third 
 58 
Chapter; and be well ware to take no consecrated thing out of the Oratory; 
and during the whole of the ensu ing period ye shall enter the Oratory and 
celebrate the OY ce with naked feet.

 E are now arrived at a point at which ye shall be able to see clearly,
 having duly followed out and obser ved the instructions which I

your Creator with a perfect heart. We are now arrived at the term, wherefore 
the following morning rise betimes, neither wash yourselves at all nor dress 
yourselves at all in your ordinary clothes; but take a Robe of Mourning; enter 
the Orator y with bare feet; go unto the side of the Censer, take the ashes 
therefrom and place them upon your head; light the Lamp; and put the hot 
coals into the Censer; and having opened the windows, return unto the door. 
There prostrate yourself with your face against the ground, and order the 
 59 
Child to put the Perfume upon the Censer, after which he is to place himself 
upon his knees before the Altar; following in all things and throughout the 
instructions which have I given unto you in the last chapter of the First Book,
 60 
to which I am here referring H. umiliate yourself before God and His
Celestial Court, and commence your Prayer with fervour, for then it is that 
you will begin to enXame yourself in praying, and you will see appear an 
extraordinary and supernatural Splendour which Wll the wwill hole apartment,
and will surround you with an inexpressible odour, and this alone will console 
you and comfort your heart so that you shall call for ever happy the Day of the 
 61 
Lord. Also the Child will experience an admirable feeling of contentment in
the presence of the Angel. And you shall continue always your Prayer 
redoubling your ardour and f ervour, and shall pray the Holy Angel that he 
may deign to Sign, and write upon a small square plate of silver (which you 
shall have had made for this purpose and which you shall have placed upon 
the Altar) another Sign if you shall have need of it in order to see him; and 
everything which you are to do. As soon as the Angel shall have made the Sign 
by writing, and that he shall hav e written down some other counsel which may 
be necessar y unto you, he will disappear, but the splendour will remain. The 
which the Child having observed, and made the sign thereof unto you, you 
shall command him to bring you quickly the little plate of silver, and that 
which you Wnd written thereon you shall at once copy, and order the Child to 
replace it upon the Altar. Then you shall go forth from the Oratory and leave 
the Window open, and the Lamp alight, and d uring this whole day you shall 
not enter into the Oratory; but shall make preparation for the day following; 
and during the day you shall speak to none, no r make answer, even were it 
your own wife or children or servants; except to the Child whom you can send 
away. Also you shall beforehand have set Vyoairs in ur a order, and so arranged

them that no embarrassment may be caused you thereby, which might dis tract 
your attenti on. In the evening when the Sun shall be set, you shall eat but 
soberly; and then you shall go to rest alone; and you shall live separated from 
your wife during these days. 
 During Seven Days shall you perform the Ceremonies without failing 
therein in any way; namely, the Day of the Consecration, the Three Days of 
the Convocation of the Good and Holy Spirits, and the Three other Days of 
the Convocation of the Evil Spirits. 
 Now the second morning after, you are to be prepared to follow the 
counsel which the Angel will have given you. You will go early unto the 
Oratory, you will place the lighted charcoal and perfumes in the Censer, you 
are to relight the Lamp if it be (by that time) extinguished; and wearing the 
same Robe of Mourning as of the day before, prostrate with your face towards 
the ground, you shall humbly pray unto and supplicate the Lord that He may 
have pity on you, and that He may deign tWol y fulour prayer; that He will 
grant unto you the vision of His Holy Angels, and that the Elect Spirits may 
deign to grant unto yo their fu amiliar converse. And thus shall ye pray unto 
the utmost degree that shall be possible unto you, and with the greatest fervour 
that you can bring into action from your heart, and this during the space of 
two or three hours. Then quit the Oratory, returning thither at midday for 
another hour, and equally again in the evening; then you shall eat after the 
manner aforesaid, and go to rest. Understand also that the odour and the 
splendour will in nowise quit the Oratory. 
 The third day being now arrive d, you shall act thus. The evening (before) 
you shall wash your whole body thoroughly; and in the morning, being 
dressed in your ordinary garments, you shall enter into the Oratory, but with 
naked feet. Having placed the Fire and the Pe rfumes in the Censer, and lighted 
the Lamp, you shall put on the White Vestment, and place yourself on your 
knees before the Altar, to render thanks to God for all HiWs ts,bene and Wrstly 
for having granted unto you a Treasure so great and so preci ous. You shall 
render thanks also unto the Holy Guardian Angels, praying unto them that 
henceforward they will have you in their care for the whole period of your life; 
 62 
also that he will never abandon you, that he will lead you in the Way of the 
Lord, and that he will watch carefully over you to assist you, and consent unto 
the present Operation of the Sacred Magic, so that you shall have such Force 
and Virtue that you may be able to constrain the Spirits accursed of God, unto 
the Honour of your Creator, and for your own good and that of your 
neighbour. 
 And then shall yoWurst be able to put to the test whether you shall have 
well employed the period of your Six Moons, and how well and worthily you 
shall have laboured in the quest of the Wisdom of the Lord; since you shall see 
your Guardian Angel appear unto you in unequalled beauty; who also will

 The Sacred Magic 
converse with you, and speak in words so fuVlectiol of an and of goodness, and
with such sweetness, that no human tongue could express the same. He will 
animate you unto your great content in the fear of God, making you a recital
of the blessings which you have received from God; and bringing unto your 
remembrance the sins by which you havVended He o im during the wh ole
period of your life, will instruct you and give unto you the manner in which
you shall be able to appease Him by a pure, devout, and regulated life, and by
honest and meritorious actions, and such things as Go d shall ordain unto you.
After this he will show unto you the True Wisdom and Holy Magic, and also 
wherein you have erred in your Operation, and how thenceforward you should
proceed in order to overcome the Evil Spirits, and Wnally arrive at your desired
ends. He will promise never to abandon you, but to defend and assist you 
during the whole period of your life; on condition that you shall obey his
commands, and that y ou shall not voluntarilyVen od your Creator. In one 
word, you shall be received by him with such aVection that this description
which I here give unto you shall appear a mere nothing in comparison. 
 Now at this point I commence to restrict myself in my writing, seeing
that by the Grace of the Lord I have submitted and consigned you unto a 
Master so great that he will never let you err. 
 Observe that on the third day you sh ould remain in familiar 
 63 
conversation with your Guardian Angel. You should quit the Oratory for a
short time in the afternoon, re maining without about an hour; then for the
rest of the day you shall remain therein, receiving from the Holy Angel distinct
and ample information regarding the Evil Spirits and the manner of bringing
them into submission, carefully writing down and taking notes of all these
matters. Now, the Sun being set, you shall perform the Evening Orison with
the ordinary Perfume, giving thanks unto God in particular for the very great
Grace that He hath granted unto you in that day, there also supplicating Him
to be propitious unto you and to aid you during your whole life, so that you
shall never be able toV oend Him. You shall also render thanks unto your 
Guardian Angel and beseech him not to abandon you. The Prayer being 
Wnished you will see that the Splendour will disappear. Then shall you quit the
Oratory, closing the door, but leaving the windows open and the Lamp alight.
You shall return as on the preceding days unto your apartment where you shall
modestly recreate yourself, and eat your necessary food, then you shall go to
rest until the following morning.

 conc e rn ing th e con vo c at i on of th e sp i rits . 
 HOUGH the following advice may be scarcely necessary for the most 
 part, since I have already explained unto you all things necessar y to be 
7 done; and also seeing that your Guardian Angel will havY cientle suy 
instructed you in all that you should do; yet nevertheless I will here declare 
plainly certain matters unto you, with the idea rather of making the account of 
 65 
the Operation complete in this Boo akn, d also to give you every opportunity 
of possessing the matter thoroughly through reading these things many times; 
so that having received the Vision of the Angel, you Wmay nd yourself 
thoroughly instr ucted in all the essential points. 
 Having then reposed yourself during the night, you shall rise in the 
morning before dawn, and shall enter into the Oratory; and having placed the 
lighted Charcoal in the Censer, light the Lamp also. You shall then robe 
 66
yourself, taking Wrst the White Vestment, and over this you shall put on, that 
of Silk and Gold, then the Girdle, and upon your head you shall place the 
Crown, and you shall lay the Wand upon the Altar. Then, having put the 
Perfume in the Censer you shall fall upon your knees, and pray unto Almighty 
God to grant you the Grace toWnish y our Operation unto the Praise and 
Glory of His Holy Name, and for your own use and that of your neighbour. 
Also you shall supplicate y our Guardian Angel to aid you, and to govern your 
heart with his counsel, and all your senses. After this you shall take the Wand 
in your right hand, and pray unto God to give unto this Wand as much virtue, 
force, and power as He gave unto those Moof ses, of Aaron , of Elijah , and 
of the other Prophets whose numberW inite.s in 
 Now place yourself beside the Altar looking towards the Door and the 
 67 
open Terrace; or if you be in the C ountry place yourself at the W side,estern 
and commence by summoning the Chief Spirits and Princes. 
 But your Angel will already have instructed you how to convoke them, 
and will have suY ciently impressed it on your heart. 
 And as well in this as in the Orison, we should never proceed and act by 
the mouth only or by written Conjurations alone; but with a free hear t and 
intrepid courage; because it is certain that there is mYocure ltdiy in convoking 
 68 
the Evil Spirits than the Good, which latter usually appear more readily when 
they are Wrst called if it be by persons of good intent; while the Evil XSeepirits 
as much as possible all occasion of submitting themselves to man. This is 
wherefore be who wisheth to constrain them should be upon his guard, and 
follow out faithfully from point to point the instructions which his Guardian 
Angel will have given him, and that he impresseth them well upon his memory

 The Sacred Magic 
following them from point to point; seeing that while n o Spirit Good or Evil 
can know the secrets of your heart before you yourself bring the same to light, 
unless God Who alone knoweth all things should manifest them; they (the 
Spirits) nevertheless can penetrate into and understand that which you are 
 69 
thinking by means of your actions and your wo This is the rrds. eason why he
who wisheth properly to convoke and conjure the Spirits, should Wrst well 
consider the following Conjuration; and afterward perform it with feeling and 
freely by heart; and not by writing, because in using that composed by others, 
the Spirits thence judge that we ourselves are ignorant, and render themselves 
 70 
straightway more intractable and stubbo The Ern. vil Spirits be about you, 
though invisible, and they keenly examine whether he wh o conjureth them is 
coura geous or timid, whether he is prudent, and whether he hath a true faith 
in God Who can per form all things with ease. We can constrain them (the 
Spirits), and force them to appear; but a few words ill pronounced by an 
ill-intentioned person only produce an eVect against the person himself who 
ignorantly pronounceth them; and an individu al of such a character should in 
no way undertake this Operation, for such would be the true way to make a 
mock of God and to tempt Him. 
 of th e con ju r ati on s . 
 I have many times repeated unto you that the Fe ar of God is the principal 
subject of the instruction of your Guardian Angel, against which you sh ould 
never commit any fault, even if it be but slight. 
 71
 Firstly: You should perform the Conjuration in your mother ton orgue, 
in a language that you well understand, and conjure the Spirits by the 
authority of and their obedience to the Holy Patriarchs, rehearsing unto them 
examples of their r uin and fall, of the sentence which God hath pronounced 
against them, and of their obligation unto servitude; and how on one side and 
on another they have been vanquished by the Good Angels and by Wise Men; 
all which points you will have had plenty of opportunity to study in the Sacred 
Writings during the Six Moons (of preparation). Also you shall menace them, 
in case they are unwilling to obe y, with calling unto your aid the Power of the 
Holy Angels over them. Your Guardian Angel will also have instr ucted you to 
perform this Convocation with modesty, and in no wise to be timid, but 
coura geous, yet in moderation, however, with out too overbearing hardiness 
and bravery. And in case of their being inclined to resist, and unwilling to obey 
you, you must not on that account give way to anger, because thus you will 
only do injury to yourself; and they will ask nothing better, it being exactly 
what they would be endeavouring to do; but (on the contrary) with an 
intrepid heart, and putting your whole trust in God, with a tranquil heart you 
shall exhort them to yield, letting them see that you have put all your 
68

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
conWdence in the Living and Only God, reminding them h ow powerful and 
potent He is; thus, therefore, govern yourself, using prudence towards them. 
 72 
 And communicate unto them also the Fo inrm the which you wish them 
to appear; the which you can not determine, nor even themselves, but you 
ought the evening before to have demanded this from your Guardian Angel, 
who knoweth better than you your nature and constitution, and who 
understandeth the forms which can terrify you, and those of which you can 
 73 
support the sight. 
 And you must not think that this can be d one otherwise, as certain 
Accursed Persons write; that is to say, by means of Seals, and Conjurations, 
and Superstitious Figures, and Pentacles, and other Abominations, written by 
 74 
Diabolical Enchanters; for this would be the coin wherewith the Hideous 
Satan would buy you for his slave. 
 But let your whole trust be in the Arm, the Power, and the Force of God 
Almighty; then shall you be in all safety, and the Guard of your Angel will 
defend you from all dangers. This is why you should have good courage, and 
have coWndence that no adversity can happen unto you. Observing then the 
doctrine that your Angel will have given unto you, and persevering in placing 
all your trust in God, at length they will appear in the form commanded upon 
the Terrace, upon the sand; when, according to the advice and doctrine 
received from your Holy Angel, and as I will clearly teach you in the following 
Chapter, you shall propound your demand, and you shall receive from them 
 75 
their oath.

the said Spirits, bringing to their remembrance their promises and Oaths made 
 77 
on the preceding day to send unto you the Eight Sub-Princes; and address the 
Conjuration unto all the Twelve together, and in a little while they will appear 
visibly, the Eight Sub-Princes in the form which hath been commanded them; 
and they will promise and swear unto you (allegiance), as will be more fully

Sub-Princes. But while invoking God your Lord for strength and surety, and
your Holy Angel for counsel and assistance, never forget what the latter will
have taught you, for it is a necessary point.

 The Demand of the First Day when the Four Superior Princes shall have 
visibly appeared, you shall make according unto the Order of the Angel: 
 Firstly: The Proposition by what Virtue, Power and Authority you make 
your demands unto them; that is to say by the Virtue of God our Lord Who 
hath made them subject unto all His creatures, and brought them to your 
 79 
feet. 
 80 
 Secondly: That your object is not at all a malign curiosity, but (one 
tending) unto the Honour and Glory of God, and to your own good and that 
of all the Human Race. That further, every time that you shall summon them, 
by whatever Sign or Word, and in whatever Time and Place, and for whatever 
occasion and service, they shall have to appear immediately without any delay, 
and obey your commands. And that in case they shall have some legitimate 
hindrance hereto, they are to send unto you some other Spirits assigning then 
and there such as shall be capable and po tent to accomplish and obey your will 
and your demand in their place. And that they shall promise and swear to 
observe this by the most rigorous judgment of God, and by the most seve re 
punishment and chastisement of the Holy Angels, Xicted upon them. in And
that they will consent to obey, and that the Four Sovereign Princes will name 
unto you the Eight Sub-Princes, whom they will send in their place to take the 
Oath as I have already said, to appear at once on the following morning when 
commanded by you; and that they will duly send the Eight Sub-Princes. 
 For greater certainty, quit the Altar now, and go towards the Door which

the Four Sovereign Princes. And further you shall request from these four, that 
is to say, from Oriens, Paimon, Ariton , and Amaimon; that each of them 
shall assign and consign unto you your Familiar Spirit, which from the day of 
your birth they are compelled to give unto you. These will be given and

for you to demand from these the other Spirits which you may wish to have; 
but seeing that they be inWnite in number, and one more skilful in service than 
another, one for one matter, another for another; you shall make a selection of 
the Spirits whom you wish, and you shall put outside upon the Terrace a 
written list of their names for the Eight Sub-Princes (to see), and you shall 
require from these (latter) the Oath, as you did from the Four Superior

 The Eight Sub-Princes having presented all the Spirits as you have 
 82 
directed them, you shall command that Astarot with all his following shall 
appear visibly in the Form which the Angel shall have prescribed unto you; 
and immediately you shall see a Great Army, and all under the same Form . 
You shall propound unto them the same demand, which you have already 
made unto the Princes, and you shall cause them to take Oath to observe the 
same; that is to say, that every time that you shall call one of them by his 
name, that he shall at once appear in such Form and Place as shall please you, 
and that he shall punctually execute that which you shall have commanded 
 83 
him. All having sworn, you shall put outside the entr of the Doy or, all the
 84 
Signs of the Third Book which belong untoAsta rot , alone, and make him 
 85 
swear thereon, also ordaining unto them that in cases when it may not seem 
Wt unto you to command them verbally, that as soon as you shall take o ne of 
these Signs in your hand and move it from its place that the Spirit marked in 
the Sign shall do and execute that which the Sign beareth, and that which your 
 86 87
intimation joined thereto shall indicate; also that in the case that in the Sign 
none of them shall be specially named, that all in general sha ll be obliged 
promptly and readily to perform the Operation commanded; and that if also 
in the time to come, other (Signs or) Symbols be made by you which be not 
 88 
here included, that then also they (the Spirits under Astarot) shall be equally 
bound to observe and execute them also. And when the Oath hath been taken, 
cause the Prince in the Name of the rest to touch the Wand. 
 After this, remove those Symbols from the Do orway; and call Magot , 
and after him Asmodee, and lastlyBel zebud; and act with all these as you 
have done with Astarot ; and all their Symbols having been sworn unto, put 
them aside in order in a cer tain place, so arranged that you can easily 
distinguish one from another, as regards the s ubject, operatioVn, ect,o for e r 
which they have been made, and unto which they belon g. 
 This being done, you shall call Astarot and Asmodee together, with 
 89 
their common Servitors, and shall propound unto them their Symbols; and 
72 



--------------------------------------- 35

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
having made them swear in the fore mentioned manner, you shall call in 
similar fashion Asmodee and Magot , with their Servitors, and shall make 
them take oath upon their Signs in the aforesaid manner. 
 90
 And thus shall you observe this method with the Four other Sub-Princes; 
but Wrst of all convoke them with their co mmon Servitors, and make them 
swear upon the common Signs, then Amaimon and Ariton together, and 
 91 
Wnally each one apart, as in the Wrst case. 
 And when you have put back all the Symbols into their proper place, 
 92 
request from each of these last Four your Familiar Spirit, and make them 
repeat its Name, which you shall at once write down, together with the time 
during which they shall be o bliged to ser ve you. Then you shall propound 
 93 
unto them the Signs of the Fifth Chapter o f the Third Bo and shall makeok; 
them not only swear upon these Symbols (collectively), but also each one 
(separately), that from this time forward he will observe duly and with 
 94 
diligence the six hours destined; and you shall cause them to promise to serve 
you withW delity, performing all which they are obliged to do, and that you 
shall command their (services); and that they shall not in the slightest degree 
be false and lying as regardeth you; also, that if by chance you should assign 
over one of them unto another person, that he shall act as faithfully by him as 
by yourself; and, lastly, that they are toWl, f perul form, and execute, that which 
God for their Chastisement hath destined unto them for Sentence (of 
Judgment). 
 You shall then observe this form with all the Princes, and until:all the 
Symbols shall be sworn to, with the Four Familiar Spirits and the others 
dominating (them).

 95 
away the Spirits, because they themselves are only too glad to be far away
from You. This is wherefore you need not otherwise license them to depart;
that is to say that during the Three Days, having Wnished speaking with the
Four Sovereign Princes, and afterwards with the Eight Sub-Princes, and
received their Oath (of allegiance), y ou shall say unto them that for the present
they can go unto their destined place; and that ev ery time that they shall be

 HE Wicked Devil knoweth full well that you are in no way obliged 
 unto him, and that you have commenced this Operation under the 
7 Grace and Mercy of God, and under the protection and defence of the 
Holy Angels; nevertheless, he will not fail to tr y his fortune, and he will seek to 
turn you aside from the Veritable Path; but be you constant and courageous, 
and swerve not in any way, either to the right hand or to the left. If he showeth 
himself proud with you, render unto him the like, and in your turn show him 
your p ride. I f h e b e h umble, b e i n n o wise t oo r ude a nd s evere t oward him, 
but be moderate in all things. If he asketh you some matter, you shall make 
answer unto him according to the instruction which the Guardian Angel shall 
 96 
have given you; and understand that the Four Princes, more than all the rest, 
will powerfully tempt you, saying unto “Wyou ho is he who hath given sothee 
great authority?” They will reproach you with your hardihood and 
presumption in summoning them, knowing how powerful they are, and 
contrariwise, how weak and sinful you yourself are. They will reproach you 
with your sins, and will especially seek to dispute with you concerning your 
religion and your faith in God: if you be a Jew they will tell you that your faith 
and your religion have been refuted by God Himself, and that you observe not 
the True Law as it should be (observed): also if you be a Pagan they will say, 
What hath God to do with you or His Creatures either, seeing that you know 
not God ? if you be a Christian they will say unto you, What business is it of 
yours to have to do with Hebrew Ceremonies which are tainted with idolatry, 
and the like ? But let none of this disqu iet you in the least; answer them in few 
words, and laughingly, that it is none of their business to discuss these matters 
with you, and to deliver their opinions concerning them; and that alth ough 
you may be a worthless wretch and a gr eat sinner, you will yet hope that the 
True and Only God, Who hath created the Heaven and the Earth, and Who 
 97 
hath condemned them and brought them into submission under your feet, 
will forgive you your sins, both now and in future, whatever may be the 
religion which you profess. (Further that) you wish to know, understand, 
confess, and honour no other than the Great and Only God, the Lord of 
Light, by Whose Power, Virtue, and Authority you command them to obey 
you. 
 When you shall have spoken unto them thus, then will they sing another 
song, telling you that if you wish them to serve and to be obedient unto you,

that you must Wrst come to terms with them. Then shall you answer them on 
this wise: 
 98 
 “God our Lord hath condemned and sentenced y to serou ve me, and I
do not treat as an equal with those who are accustomed to obey”. 
 Then will they demand of you some saWcecri or courtesy if you wish to be 
served and obeyed promptly. You shall reply that Wcesacri is not to be made 
unto them, but rather unto the only God. 
 They will then entreat you not to hinder or bring to shame by means of 
this Wisdom any of their Devotees and Enchanters in their operations and 
enchantments. You shall then make answer that you are obliged to pursue the 
Enemies of God and the Lord, and to repress their malice, and also to save and 
defend your neighbour, and any who arVended and hure o t by them.
 Then with much verbiage, and an inWnitude of diVerent ways will they 
make severe attacks upon you, and even the Familiar Spirits will rise up against 
you in their turn. These latter will demand and beseech of you that you will in 
no way give them over unto others (to serve them). HWrm, old however, and 
promise nothing either to one class (of Spirits) or another; but reply to them 
that every true and brave man is obliged to aid and serve his friends to the best 
of his ability, and with all his po ssessions, among the which they must 
assuredly also be comprised. 
 When at length they see that they have lost all hope of making you 
prevaricate, and that they can obtain nothing notwithstanding all their 
requests; they will deWnitely surrender, and will ask nothing else of you unless 
it be that you shall not be too rude and insulting in commanding them. You 
shall make answer to this, that if they prove themselves to be obedient and 
prompt in serving you, that it may be that your Angel, by whose instruction 
and command you are governing yourself, may instruct you not to be so rigid 
and severe with them if they shall obey, and that in such case you will act as 
may be right.

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 TH E E I GH TE EN TH CH A P T ER . 
 ho w he wh o op era t et h sh ou ld b e ha ve as reg a rd eth t he 
 sp ir its . 
 E have already seen how one should constrain the Spirits, and what 
 one should ask of them; also how to dismiss them without hurt, and 
: how we should make answer unto their demands and 
 99 
presentments. 
 All that I am about to say unto you now is superXuous, because it is 
certain that any one who shall have observed with a true hearWrmt and 
resolution the advice w hich I have given regarding the Six Moons, will be 
instructed with so much thoroughness and clearness by his Guardian Angel, 
that no doubtful point will present itself which he will not be able easily to 
clear up of himself. 
 We have also alreadyY suciently shown how on every or any occasion, he 
who operateth should comport himself as regardeth the Spirits; that is to say as 
their Lord, and not as their Servitor. Ye t in all matters there should be a 
reasonable mean, seeing that we are not treating with men, but with Spirits, of 
whom each one knoweth more than the whole Universe together. 
 Now if you shall make some demand unto a Spirit, and he shall refuse to 
execute it; Wrst well and carefully examine and consider whether it be in the 
power and nature of the Spirit to whom you make such demand, Wl theto ful 
same. For one Spirit knoweth not all things, and that which appertaineth unto 
the one, another knoweth not. For this reason, see that ye well take heed 
before endeavouring to force them to perform a matter. Ye t if, h owever, the 
Inferior Spirits be disobedient, you shall call their Superiors, and remind them 
of the oaths which they have taken unto you, and of the chastisement which 
awaiteth the breaking of such vows. 
 And immediately, on beholding your steadfastness, they will obey you; 
but should they not, you ought then to invoke your Guardian Angel, whose 
chastisement they will quickly feel. 
 Yet, notwithstanding, we should never employ harsh means, in order to 
 100 
have that which we can obtain by gentleness and co urtesy. 
 If during the Invocation they should appear with tumult and insolence, 
fear nothing; neither give way to anger; but appear to make no account 
thereof. Only show them the Consecrated Wand, and if they continue to make 
a disturbance, smite upon the Altar twice or thrice therewith, and all will be 
still. 
 It should be noted, that after you shall have licensed them to depart, and 
they shall have disappeared, you shall take the Censer from the top of the

 The Sacred Magic
Altar, and having put perfume therein, take it out of the Oratory on to the
Terrace whereon the Spirits shall have appeared, and you shall perfume the
place all round; for otherwise the Spirits might work some evil unto persons
entering by chance therein. 
 Now should you be willing to content yourself with the Symbols which
be in the Third Book here following; you shall the day after take away all the
Sand from the Terrace and cast it into a secret place; but above all things take
care not to throw it either into a river or into the navigable sea.
 But should you desire to procure for yourself various other Symbols and
Secrets, leave the Sand and all things in place, as we shall also describe more
particularly in the last chapter. 
 Also, should you wish it, you can retain your arrangements in place, and
keep the Apartment of the Oratory proper and clean, as well as the Altar;
which latter you may place in a corner, should it incommode you in the centre
of the room. For in this Apartment, if it be not contaminated n or profaned,
you may every Saturday enjoy the presence of your Guardian Angel; the which
is one of the most sublime things which you can desire in this Sacred Art.

 I have thought it advisable to gi ve as far as possible some idea of Wtcahet i onSigns oi f
these names of Spirits, which are for the most part derived from the Hebrew or Chaldee, and
also from Greek and Lati n and Coptic, etc. 
 THE CHIEF SPIRITS. 
 Lucifer : From Latin, Lux, Light, and Fero,to bear, - A Light Bearer. There is a name
“Lucifuge” also employed occasionally, frLuomx, Light, and Fugio, to Xy from, - He who
shuns the Light. 
 LEVIATAN: From HebrewLV, IThN (usually written Leviathan instead of Leviatan), -
the Crooked or Piercing Serpent or Dragon. 
 Satan : From Hebrew, ShTN, = an Adversary. 
 Belial : From Hebrew, BLIOL, = a Wicked One. 
 THE EIGHT SUB-PRINCES. 
 Astarot : From HebrewOS, hThRVTh , = Xocks, crowds or assemblies. Usually written
“Ashtaroth”. Also a name of the Goddess Astarte; Esther is derived from the same root.
 Magot : May be from HebrewMO, VTh , = small stones or pebbles; or from MG, = a
changing of camp or place; or from GreMaekg, os, a magician. Usually written Maguth.
Compare the French wordMa “go,” t meaning “a sort of baboon,” and also “a hideous
dwarWsh man”; this expression is often used in fairy-tales to denote a spiteful dwarf or elf.
This Spirit has also been credited wi th presiding over hidden treasure. Larousse derives the
name either from ancient French or German. 
84 



--------------------------------------- 47

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 Asmodee: Usually written “Asmodeus,” and sometimes “Chashmodai”. Derived by 
some from the Hebrew word “Asamod,” to destroy or exterminate; and by others from the 
Persian verb “Azmonden,” = to tempt, to try or prove. Some Rabbins say that Asmodeus was 
the child of the incest of Tubal-Cain and his sister Naafrfah. Others say that he was the 
Demon of impurity. Others again relate that he was employed by Solomon i n the building of 
the Temple at Jerusalem; that he then attempted to dethrone Solomon, to put himself in his 
place; but that the King vanquished him and the Angel Gabriel chased him into Egypt, and 
there bound him in a Grotto. The Rabbins say that when Asmodeus was working at the 
building of the Temple, he made use of no metal tool; but instead of a certain stone which 
cut ordinary stone as a diamond will glass. 
 Belzebud: Also written frequently “Beelzebub”, “Baalzebub”, “Beelzebuth”, and 
“Beelzeboul”. From Hebrew, BOL, = Lord, and ZBVB,= Fly or Flies; Lord of Flies. Some 
derive the name from the SyriacBeel d “ 'Bobo,” = Master of Calumny, or nearly the same 
signiWcation as the Greek worDiad bolos , whence are derived the modern French and 
English “Diable” and “Devil”. 
 Oriens : These four names of Oriens, Paimon, Ariton and Amaymon,are usually 
all otted to the Evil Kings of the four quarters of the World. Oriens, from LatiOrienn, , s = 
rising or Eastern. This name is also written Uriens, from LatiUron, , = to burn, or devour 
with Xame. It is probably from Uriens that a mediaeval ti tle of the Devil, viz., “Sir Urien”, is
derived. The Name is also sometimes written “Urieus,” from LatiUrion, “s ”, a title given to 
Jupiter as presiding over the Wind. Urieus is also derivable from the Greek A“Eurus,dj. 
Eureia, Euru,” meaning vast or extensive. By the Rabbins he is also called SMAL, Samael, 
which is derived from the Hebrew root SML, which meanWgus “a re, image, or idol”. It is a 
name given in the Qabalah to one of the Chief Evil Spirits. 
 Paimon: Is also frequently written “Paymon”, and sometimes “Paimonia”. Probably 
from Hebrew, POMN, = a tinkling sound or small bell. This is again derived from the 
Hebrew root POM, = to agitate, impel, or strike forward. The word POMN is employed in 
Exodus 28, 34; 28, 33; and 39, 25. Paimon is also called by the Rabbins by the title of 
OZAZL, Azazel, which is a name used in Leviticus with reference to the Scape-Goat. Its 
derivation is from OZ, = a Goat; and AZL, = to go away. It has frequently been warmly 
discussed whether the word in question means simply the Scape-Goat, or whethWeesr it signi 
a Demon to whom that animal was dedicated. But in Rabbinic Demonology it is always used 
to mean one of the Chief Demons. 
 Ariton : It is also often called “Egyn," or “Egin”. This name may be derived from the 
Hebrew root ORH, = to lay bare, to make naked. It may also be derived from the Greek 
word Arhreton , = secret, or mysterious, in any sense good or bad. Egin, may be derivable 
from Hebrew, OGN, = to delay, hinder, or retard. There may also be a connection with the 
Greek Aix,Ai g os, = a Goat. This Spirit is also called by the Rabbins OZAL, Azael, from the 
root OZ, which means both a Goat, and also vigour, vehemence of force; thus having partly 
the same root as “Azazel”. 
 Amaimon: Also written frequently “Amaymon”; perhaps from the Greek word 
Maimon, present participle of Maimao; and A as an enforcing particle; hence Amaimon 
would mean “terrible violence and vehemence”. This Spirit is also called by the Rabbins 
MHZAL, Mahazael, perhaps from the root MZ, = to consume, or devour. Amaymon is 
spoken of in the various mediaeval Magical works as being a very potent Spirit, and the use 
of a ring, with Magical characters to hold before the mouth while conversing with him, is 
recommended as a protection against his deadlyWery,, and poisonous breath.

 T H E TWENTIET H C HAPTE R,
 h ow t he op era tio ns s hou l d be p erf or med.
 HE aforesaid Operation being Wnished, it is necessary, in order to
 render this instruction complete, to say how we should manage the
7 Operations which he who operateth wisheth to put into practice.
 Firstly, then, having come unto the end, and having obtained all that is
necessary; you cannot suY cientl y praise and honour God, and His Most Holy
Name, even although you had a thousand tongues; neither also can you
suY ciently magnify and thank your Holy Angel Guardian as he meriteth.
However, you ought to render thanks proportionate to your estate and to the
Great Treasure which you have received. It is necessary also that you should
fully understand how you ought to enjoy these immense riches, s o that they
may not be in your hands unfruitful, or even harmful. Because this Art is like a
Sword in your hand, capable of serving for all kinds of evil and for hurt unto
your neighbour. But in putting it into practice for that sole end for which it
bath been made, namely for vanquishing therewith Dethe mon and Enemies,
then shall you be making a good use hereof. I wish also further to give you
some instruction upon certain necessary and principal points.
 The Operation of the Spirits being Wnished, you shall continue a whole
week to praise God; and as regardeth yourself personally, you shall do no
servile work during the Seven Days, neither shall you make any Convocation
of the Spirits in general, nor of the Familiars; and af terwards, when the Seven
Days be passed, you shall commence to exercise your power, as shall be
hereafter said: 
 (1) Take heed before all things to per form no Magical Operation soever,
or Invocations of the Spirits on the Sabbath Day, during the whole period of
your life, seeing that that day is consecrated unto God, and is the day on
which you should repose and sanctify yourself, and you should solemnise it by
prayers. 
 (2) Keep yourself as you would from the Eternal Fire, from manifesting
unto any living being that w hich your Guardian Angel shall havWdede con
unto you; excepting unto him who hath given unto you the Operation, unto
whom you have as it were a greater obligation than unto your own father.
 (3) As far as lieth in your power take heed in no way to make use of this
Art against your neighbour; except for a just Vengeance; although I counsel
88 



--------------------------------------- 51

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
you even in this particular to imitate God, who pardoneth even you yourself, 
and there is not in the world a more meritorious action than to pardon. 
 (4) In the case of your Angel dissuading you from some Operation, and 
forbidding you to do the same, keep well from becoming obstinate therein, for 
you would in such a case ever repent it. 
 (5) Fly all kinds of (Evil) Science, Magic, and Enchantments, beca use they 
be all Diabolical Inventions; also put no trust in books which teach them, 
though in appearance they may seem reliable to you, for these be nets which 
the perWdious Belial stretcheth out to take you. 
 (6) In conversing with Spirits Good or Evil, never employ words which 
you do not understand, because even so will you have shame and hurt. 
 (7) You shall never demand of your Guardian Angel any Symbol 
wherewith to operate for an Evil end, seeing that you would grieve him. You 
will Wnd only too many persons who will beseech y ou to do thus; see that you 
do it not! 
 (8) Accustom yourself as much as possible to purity of body and 
cleanliness of raiment, seeing that this is very necessary; for the Spirits, both 
Good and Evil alike, love purity. 
 (9) As far as possible shun the employment of your Wisdom for others in 
evil things; but Wrst well consider him to whom you would render a service; 
because it often happeneth, that in doing service unto another one worketh 
evil for oneself. 
 (10) In no way attempt to procure the Operation of the Holy Angels 
unless you have extreme need ther eof, seeing that these Holy Angels be so far 
above you that it is useless for you to wish to compare yourself unto Them, 
you being nothing in comparison of Them Who are the Angels of God. 
 (11) If the Operations can be performed by the Familiar Spirits, it is not 
necessary to employ others therein. 
 (12) Though it should be an easy matter for you to employ your Familiars 
to annoy your neighbour, seek to abstain therefrom, unless it were to repress 
the insolence of such as might attempt aught against you personally. Never 
keep the Familiar Spirits in idleness, and should you wish to give one over 
unto any person, see that such person be distinguished and meritorious, for 
 89



--------------------------------------- 52

 The Sacred Magic 
they love not to serve those of base and common condition. But should such 
person unto whom you give them have made some express Pact (with Spirits) 
in such case the Familiar Spirits will Xy in haste to serve him. 
 (13) These three Books of this present Operation ought to be read and 
re-read an inWnitude of times; so that in the space of Six Months before 
commencing, he who operateth should be fully instructed and informed 
therein; and if he be not a Jew, he should further be conversant with many of 
the customs and ceremonies which this Operati on demandeth, so as to 
become accustomed unto that retirement which is so necessary and useful. 
 (14) Should he who performeth this Operation during the Six Months or 
Moons commit voluntarily any mortal sin prohibited by the Tables of the Law, 
be certain that he will never receive this Wisdom. 
 (15) Sleep in the day-time is entirely forbidden, unless absolutely 
requisite, owing to some inWrmity, or to old age, or to debility of constitution; 
 104 
for God is always willing to employ mer tocy wards mankind, because of 
their inWrmities. 
 (16) If you have not the Wxed intention of continuing the Operation, I 
counsel you on no account to commence it; because the Lord doth not care to 
be mocked, and He chastiseth with corporal maladies those who make a mock 
of Him. Howbeit, he who is hindered from continuing through some 
unforeseen accident, sinneth in no way. 
 (17) It is impossible for him who hath passed Wfty years of age to 
undertake this Operation. Thus also was it the custom in the true and ancient 
Je wish Law concerning the Priesthood. Also, he should not be less than 
twenty-Wve years of age. 
 (18) You shall not permit the Familiar Spirits to familiarise themselves too 
much with you, through your disputing and arguing with them; because they 
will propound so manyV aairs and things at once as to confound and trouble 
the mind. 
 (19) With the Familiar Spirits you should n ot make use of the Symbols of 
 105 
the Third Book, unless it be those of the Fifth Chapter ther buteof; if you 
desire anything, command them aloud to perform it. Never commence many 
Operations at once and in the same time, but when you Wnished ohave ne
then begin another, until you are perfect in the practice; for an Apprentice 
Artist doth not become a Master suddenly, but little by little. 
90 



--------------------------------------- 53

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 106 
 (20) Without reasons of the very last importance, the Four Princes or
 107 
the Eight Sub-Princes should never be summoned, because we must make a 
great distinction between these and the others (who are inferior to them). 
 (21) In operating, as rarely as possible insist upon the Spirits appearing 
 108 
visibly; and thus you will work all the better, for it shouYld suce you for 
them to say and do what you wish. 
 (22) All Prayers, Orations, Invocations, and Conjurations, and in fact 
everything you have to say, should be pronounced aloud and clearly, without 
 109 
however shouting like a madman, but speaking clearly and naturally, and 
pronouncing distinctly. 
 (23) During the Six Moons, you shall sweep the Oratory every Sabbath 
Eve, and keep it strictly clean, for it is a place dedicated unto the Holy and 
Pure Angels. 
 (24) Take heed that you commence no Operation at night if it be 
important, unless the need be very pressing. 
 (25) Your only object during your whole life should be to shun as far as 
possible an ill-regulated life, and especially the vices of debauchery, gluttony, 
 110 
and drunkenness. 
 (26) Having completed the Operation, and being now the Possessor of 
the True Wisdom, you shall fast three days before commencing to put it in 
practice. 
 (27) Every year you should make a commemoration of the Signal beneWt 
which the Lord hath conferred upon you; at such time feasting, praying, and 
honouring your Guardian Angel that day with your whole strength. 
 (28) During the Three Days on which you constrain the Spirits you shall 
fast, for this is essential, so that when you are working yoWu ndma yy ourself 
freer and more tranquil both in body and mind. 
 (29) Note that the fasts are to be understood as commencing always from 
the Wrst nocturnal Star, and not otherwise. 
 (30) Keep as an indubitable precept never to give this Operation unto a 
 111 
Monarch, because Solomon was the Wrst wh o abused it; and if you should do 
the contrary, both you and your successors would alike lose the Grace hereof.

 The Sacred Magic 
With regard to this command, I myself having been sought by the Emperor 
Sigismond, gave him willingly the best Familiar Spirit which I had; but I 
steadily refused to give him the Operation; and it should not be given unto 
Emperors, Kings, or other Sovereigns. 
 (31) You may assuredly give, but it is not permissible to sell, this 
(Operation), for this would be to abuse the Grace of the Lord who hath given 
it unto you, and should you act contrariwise unto this, you would lose its 
control. 
 (32) Should you perform this Operation in a town, you should take a 
house which is not at all overlooked by any one; seeing that in this present 
 112 
day Curiosity is so strong that you ought to be upon your guard; and there 
ought to be a garden (adjoining the house) wherein you can take exercise. 
 (33) Take well heed during the Six Moons or Months to lose no blood 
from your body, except that which the expulsive Virtue in you may expel 
naturally of its own accord. 
 (34) Finally, during that whole time, you shall touch no dead body of any 
description soever. 
 (35) You shall eat du ring this whole period neither Xesh nthe or the blood 
 113
of any dead animal; and this you shall do for a certain particular reason. 
 (36) You shall bind by an Oath him unto whom you shall give this 
Operation, neither to give nor sell it unto any avowed Atheist or Blasphemer 
of God. 
 (37) You shall fast for three days before giving the Operation unto any; 
and he who shall receive it shall do likewise; and he also shall hand over unto 
you at the same time the sum of Ten Golden Florins, or their value, the which 
you should with your own hand distribute unto poor persons whom you shall 
charge to repeat the Psalms, Miserere Mei Deuets,c., “H ave mercy upon me, O
God”; and the De Profundis, etc., “Out of the Depths”. 
 (38) It will be a good thing, and one which will facilitate the Operation, 
for you to repeat all the Psalms of David, seeing that they contain great power 
and virtue; and to say them at least twice in the week. 
 Also you shall shun gaming as you would the plague; because it ever is an 
occasion of Blasphemy. Also during this time prayer, and the study of the 
 114 
Sacred Books, should take the place of gaming with you.

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 All this advice, and much more which you would be certain to receive 
from your Angel Guardian, I have here set down, so that by observing the 
same perfectly, without failing in the slightest particular, you shall at the end of 
the Operation Wnd the value thereof. I am now, therefore, ab out to give you 
 115 
distinct and suY cient information h ow to employ the Symbo and hols, w to
proceed if you wish to acquire others. 
 You are then to understand that once he who operateth hath the power, it 
 116 
is not necessary (in all cases) to use written Symbols, but it may suY ce to 
name aloud the Name of the Spirit, and the, fo rm in which you wish him to 
 117 
appear visibly; because once they have taken Oath, this suY ceth. These 
Symbols, then, be made for you to avail yourself of them when you be in the 
company of other persons; also you must have them upon you, so that in 
touching or handling them simply, they may represent your wish. Immediately 
 118 
then he unto whom the Symbol appertaineth will serve you punctually; but 
if you should desire something special which is in no way connected with or 
named in the Symbol, it will be necessary to signify the same at least by 
showing your desire by two or three words. And here it is well to observe, that 
if you use prudence, you can often reason with those persons who be with you 
in such a manner that the Spirits, having however been before hand invoked by 
you, will understand what they are to do; b ut it is necessary to discover your 
intent unto them by words. For they be of such great intelligence, that from a 
single word or a single motive, they can draw the construction of the whole 
matter; and although they cannot penetrate into the inmost parts of the 
human mind, yet nevertheless by their astuteness and subtlety they be so 
adroit that they comprehend by perceptible signs the wish of the person in 
question. 
 But when it is a grave and important matter, you should retire into a 
secret place apart, provided it be appropriate, for any place is good to invoke 
the Spirits proper unto the Operation. There give them their commission 
regarding that which you wish them to perform, the which they will either 
execute then or in the days following. But always give them the signal by word 
of mouth, or in any other manner that may be pleasing u nto you, whenever 
you wish them to begin to operate. Thus Adid bramelin in Egypt, Joseph in 
Paris, and as for myself, I have always acted in the same manner. I have also 
made myself a very great man, and especially one who hath been of service 
unto Princes and great Lords. 
 I will hereafter tell clearly what Operations belong unto this or unto that 
Spirit, and how it is necessary to act. 
 Now will I teach you how all those (Symbols) which be in this Book, as 
well as those which you will (hereafter) receive from the Spirits (themselv es), 
ought to be written down and acquired. For the number of Operations is 
inWnite, and it would be an impossibility to set them all d own in this work. If

therefore you should wish to perform certain fresh Operati ons by the use of a 
speaking of good 
 119 
Symbol not set d own in any yway in the Thirou shall make the demand therd Book [I am speaking eof fromo fy ogouodr
Guardian Angel in this manner: 
 Fast the day before, and on the following morning you, being well 
washed, shall enter into the Oratory, put on the White Tunic, illumine the 
Lamp, and put the Perfume in the Censer. Then lay the Lamen of Silver upon 
the Altar, where of the two Angles shall be touched with the Holy Anointing 
Oil; fall upon your knees and make your Orison unto the Lord, rendering 
unto Him grace for the benWts e which you have received in general. 
 Then shall you supplicate Him to be willing to send unto you your Holy 
Angel, that he may instruct you in your ignorance, and that he may deign to 
grant your demand. After this, invoke your Holy Guardian Angel, and pray 
him to favour you with his vision, and to instruct you how you should design 
and prepare the Symbol of the Operation desired. Also you shall remain in 
prayer until you shall see appear in the room the Splendour of your Angel. 
Then wait to see if he shall expo und or command anything touching the form 
of the Symbol demanded. And when you Whavnished e your supplication, arise 
and go to the Plate of Silver, whereon you shall Wnd written as it were in drops 
of dew, like a sweat exuding therefrom, the Symbol as you ought to make it, 
together with the Name of the Spirit who should serve you for this Operation, 
or else that of his Prince. And without touching or moving the Lamen, copy at 
once the Symbol just as it appeareth, and leave the Plate of Metal upon the 
Altar until the even; at the which time, after having made your ordinary 
Orison, and returned your thanks, you shall put it away in a piece of clean silk. 
 The most convenient Day for procuring these Symbols is the Sabbath; 
because by such an Operation, we do not in any way violate (its sanctity), 
neither do we injure the same at all. Also we can prepare all things necessary 
the day before. But if the Angel should not appear, and should not in any way 
manifest unto you the Symbol, then may you be certain that the pretended 
Operation, although it may appear good in your eyes, is not so considered by 
God and by your Guardian Angel and in such case you shall change your 
demands. 
 Now, as regardeth the Symbols for Evil Operations, these shall you obtain 
more easily; seeing that after (putting on) the Perfume, there is nothing else to 
do but to make your Orisons. Then being clad in your White Tunic, you shall 
put on over it the Silken Vestment and the Girdle, and after that the Crown, 
taking the Wand in your hand, and placing yourself at the side of the Altar 
towards the Terrace. Then, holding the Wand, conjure in the same manner as 
you did on the Second Day. And when the Spirits shall have appeared, you 
shall command them in no way to quit the place, until they shall have 
manifested unto you the Symbol of the Operation which you desire, together

with the Names of the Spirits capable of putting the same into execution, 
together with their Symbols. And then you shall see the Prince unto whom the 
Operation appertaineth avow, write, and sign upon the Sand the Symbol, 
together with the Name of the Spirit who is to ser ve for this Operation. Then 
shall you take the Surety and Oath of the Prince upon the Symbol, and also of 
his Ministers, as you will have previously done in accordance with the 
 120 
(directions given in the) Fourteenth Chapter And sho. uld several Symbols be 
given, make them take Oath upon them all. This being done, you can dismiss 
them in the manner we have already described, taking heed before this to copy 
the Symbols which they shall have traced upon the Sand, because in departing 
they will destroy the same. And when they have gone, take the Censer and 
perfume the place, as before said. 
 I do not however write this, so that you may hereby, as well as by the use 
of certain of the Symbols described in the Third Book, work Evil; I have in no 
way written them down for such an end; but only that you may understand 
the full Perfection of this Art, and what we can herewith perform. For the Evil 
Spirits be exceeding prompt and exceeding obedient in the working of Evil; it 
is to be wished that they were as much so for the Good. However, take heed 
that you be upon your guard. 
 And remember, that as there is a God to write these aforesaid Symbols, 
there is no particular preparation necessary of Pens, of Ink, and of Paper; nor 
yet of elections of particular Days, nor other things to be observed, which the 
False Magicians and Enchanters of the Devil would have you believe. It 
suY ceth that the Symbols should be clearly written with any kind of Ink and 
Pen, provided that we may easily discern unto what Operation each Sign 
appertaineth, the which also you can easily do by means of a properly arranged 
and drawn up Register of them. But the greatest part of the Symbols of the 
Third Book I counsel you to make before commencing the Operation, 
keeping them until that time in the interio r of the Altar. And after that the 
Spirits shall hav e taken Oath thereupon, you shall carefully keep (the Symbols) 
in a safe place, where they can neither be seen nor touched by any other 
person, because thus great harm might befal such pers on. 
 Now will we declare unto you what Symbols be manifested by the Good 
Angels and what by the Evil, and unto what Prince each Operation is subject, 
and lastly, what should be observed as regardeth each Symbol.

 Chapter I. ( To know all manner o f things Past and Future, which be not
however directly opposed to God, and to His Most Holy Will.) 
 First take the Symbol in your hand, place it (upon the top of your head)
under your hat, and either you will be secretly warned by the Spirit, or he will
execute that which you have the intention of commanding him to do. 
 (This next instruction is given in the MS. as relating to Chapter II., but it
evidently is more appropriate to:-) 
 Chapter III. (To cause any Spirit to appear, and take any form, such as of
Man, Animal, Bird, etc.) 
 Take in your hand the Symbol, and name the Spirit, who will appear in
the form commanded. 
 (The next following information evidently has reference to the Symbols of
the Fifth Chapter, but there is no number subjoined as in the other cases in the
original MS. 
 Chapter V. (How we may retain the Familiar Spirits bond or free, in 
whatsoever form.) 
 We must understand that every man may have Four Familiar or Domestic 
Spirits, and no more. These Spirits can serve you in many ways, and they are
granted unto you by the Sub-Princes. 
 The First hath his period of power from Sunrise until Noon. 
 The Second, from Noon until the Setting of the Sun. 
 The Third, from the Setting of the Sun until Midnight. 
 And the Fourth, from Midnight even unto the Sunrising of the following
Day. 
 He who possesseth them is free to avail himself of their services under
whatever form may be pleasing unto him. 
 Of this kind of Spirits there is an inWnite number, who at the time of their
fall were condemned to serve man; and to each man there be four of them 
destined; and each one is obliged to serve during a period of Six Hours, and in
the case of your giving one over unto some other person, you can no longer 
avail yourself of his services, but in order to replace him during his time of
service, you may call upon some other Spirit. And should you wish to send 
away one of the said Spirits before the Six Hours during which he is on Guard
be expired, it suY ceth for you to make him some sign that he can go , and at
once he will obey. But when the Six Hours of their Guard be expired, the

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
aforesaid Spirits will depart of their own accord without demanding your 
permission, and the next in rotation will successively take the place (of his 
predecessor). But if you have given one away (unto another person), you will 
 125 
employ one of the common kind in his place. 
 Chapter VIII. (To excite Tempests.) 
 If you should wish to excite Tempests, give the Signal above your head 
(and touch the Symbol on the top); and when you wish to make them cease, 
you shall touch it on the underneath side. 
 Chapter IX. (To transform Animals into Men, and Men into Animals, 
etc.) 
 Let the being, whether Man or Animal, see the Symbol, and then touch 
them suddenly with it, when they will appear transfo rmed; but this will be 
only a species of Fascination. When you wish to make it cease, you shall put 
the Symbol upon the head (of the being) and strike it with the Wand, and the 
Spirit will then restore matters to their former condition. 
 Chapter XI. (To cause all kinds of Books to be brought to one, and 
whether lost or st olen.) 
 Our predecessors, from the commencement of the World, have written 
many and dive rs excellent Books of the Qabalah, whose value surpasseth that 
of all the riches of the World. These Books have been for the most part lost by 
the Prov idence or Command of God, who hath not been willing that His 
High Mysteries should be made public by such means; seeing that hereby 
through such Books the Worthy and Unworthy can equally arrive at the 
enjoyment and possession of the Secret things of the Lord. Some also have 
been burned in Wres, or swept away by the Waters, and other similar accidents 
(have occurred) through the Evil Spirits, who are jealous of Man's possessing 
such great treasures, and of being obliged to obey him. But this Third Part (of 
this Book), that is to say the Sacred Magic, is that which hath not been entirely 
lost, but the greater part hath been hidden and built up within a wall, and this 
hath happened by order of the Good Spirits, who have not permi tted this Art 
to altogether perish, being willing that he who should (desire the same) should 
employ honourable means to obtain the same from the True and only God, 
and not from that PeWdiour s One and Deceiver, the Devil, and his following. 
 This Operation being completed in the proper manner, you will be able 
to see and to read these Books; but it is not permitted unto you to copy them, 
nor to keep them in your mem ory more than once. As for myself, I have made 
every eVort to copy them, but as fast as I wrote, the writing used to disappear 
from the page; whence you may conclude that the Lord knowing our nature, 
which is inclined unto Evil, doth not wish that such great Treasures should be

 The Sacred Magic 
 126 
employed to serve unto that end, and unto the destruction of the Human
Race. 
 Chapter XII. (To know the Secrets of any person.) 
 For this Operation it suY ceth to touch the Symbol, for at once the Spirit
doth whisper the reply in your ear; but should you comprehend by such a
means anything vile, w hatever it may be, as you love the Grace of the Lord, see
that you keep yourself from making manifest that which (you have obtained
by the use of ) the Symbol, seeing that by so doing you might work harm unto
your neighbour. Every time that you touch the Symbol you should mention by
name the person whose Secrets you desire to know. 
 Chapter XIII. (To cause a dead body to revive, and perform all the
functions which a living person would do, and this during a space of Seven
Years, by means of the Spirits.) 
 I can in truth both say and aY rm that a man who hath just died is
divided into Three Parts, viz.: Body, Soul, and Spirit. The Body returneth
unto the Earth, the Soul unto God or unto the Devil, and the Spirit hath its
period determined by its Creator, that is to say, the Sacred Number of Seven
Years, during the which it is permitted to wander hither and thither in any
 127 
direction; at length it taketh its decisio an, nd goeth straightway unto the
place whence it came fo rth (at the beginning). To change the condition of the
Soul is impossible, but the Grace of the Lord, for many causes and reasons
which it is not here permitted unto me to make manifest, hath been willing to
permit that, with the aid of the Spirits, we may force the Spirit to return and
to conjoin itself again with the Body, so that for the space of Seven Years it can
operate any matter. And although this Spirit and the Body joined together can
perform all the functions and exercises which they used to execute when the
Body, the Soul and the Spirit we re together, yet is it only an imper fect Body,
being in this case without the Soul. 
 This Operation is, however, one of the greatest, and one which we should
only perform in extraordinarily important cases; seeing that in order to
accomplish it the Chief Spirits have to operate. 
 Nothing else is necessary than to be attentive to the moment when the
Man is just dead, and then to place the Symbol upon him towards the Four
 128 
Quarters of the World; and at once he will lift himself up and begin to move
himself He should then be dressed; and a Symbol similar to that which hath
been placed upon him should be sewn into his garment. Know also that when
the Seven Years be expired, the Spirit which was conjoined with the Body will
at once depar t, and that we cannot further prolong the period of the aforesaid
Seven Years. I made proof of this Operation in the Morea for the Duke of
Saxonia, who had only children who were minors, and the eldest was between

appropriated unto themselves; and by this means I provided (against the 
contingency), and prevented that estate from falling into other hands. 
 Chapter XIV. (The Twelve Symbols for the Twelve Hours of the Day and 
of the Night, to render oneself Invisible unto every person.) 
 To render oneself invisible is a very easy matter, but it is not altogether 
permissible, because that by such a means we can annoy our neighbour in his 
(daily) life, for we can easily employ the same for producing vVaects,rious e 
and we can also work an Wnituin de of evils (herewith). But, honestly speaking, 
we must not do the latter, such being expressly forbidden by God. This is 
wherefore I entreat you to avail yourself hereof always for a good and never for 
an evil end! You have in this Chapter Twelve Symbols, for TwVelverente di 
Spirits submitted unto Prince Magot , who are all of the same force. You 
should put the Symbol (upon the top of your head) under the hat or bonnet, 
and then you will become invisible; while on taking it away, you will appear 
visible again.

 As for this Symbol, and all like ones appertaining unto this Chapter, 
when you shall wish to make use of them, you shall put them between two 
plates, dishes, or jugs, closed together, on the outside of a window, and before 
a quarter of an hour shall have passed, youW wnd and ill, will have that which
you have demanded. But you must clearly understand that with such kind of 
viands you cannot nourish men for more than two days only; for this food, 
although it be appreciable by the eyes and by the mouth, doth not long 
nourish the body, which hath soon hunger again, seeing that this (food) giveth 
no strength to the stomach. Know also that none of these (viands) can remain 
visible for more than twenty-four hours, the which period being passed, fresh 
ones will be requisite. 
 Chapter XVI. (To Wnd and take possession of all kinds of Treasures, 
provided that they be not at all magically guarded.) 
 Should you wish to discover or to take possession of Treasure, you must 
select the Symbol which you wish, whether it be of a common or of a 
particular Operation, and the Spirit will at once show it unto you, of 
whatsoever kind, or after whatsoever fashion, it may be. Then shall you place 
the Symbol which is referable unto it thereon, and it will no longer be possible 
for it to disappear into the ground, nor for it to be carried away. Furthermore, 
 103

 The Sacred Magic 
the Spirits destined unto the Guard of this TreasureX will ee, and you can then
dispose of it as you wish, and take it a way. 
 Chapter XVII. (ToX y in the Air and travel anywhere.) 
 Name the place whitherunto you wish to travel, and place the Symbol 
upon your head, under the bonnet or the hat; but take well heed lest the 
Symbol fall from Vo you through negligence or want of caution. Do not 
journey at night-time unless necessity or some pressing reason thereto 
compelleth you, but select the day-time, and that serene and calm. 
 Chapter XVIII. (To heal divers Maladies.) 
 Undo the bandages of the sick person, and clean them, and having 
applied the unguent and the compresses, put them again upon the sick 
 129 
person;and place the Symbol upon them and leav, e it thus for about a
quarter of an hour, then take it away and keep it (for use on another occasion).
But if it be an internal malady, you shall place the Symbol upon the bare head
of the patient. These Symb ols may be seen and examined without any danger,
howbeit it is always better that they should neither be seen nor handled b y any
other person than yourself. 
 Chapter XIX. (For every description oVfe Action and Love.) 
 And 
 Chapter XX. (To excite every description of Hatred and Enmity, 
Discords, Quarrels, Contentions, Combats, Battles, Loss, and Damage.) 
 On request, and by the intermediar y of the Spirits, we can obtain love,
goodwill, and the favour of Princes and Sovereigns, on this wise: Name aloud
the person or persons by whom you wish to be loved, and move the Symbol 
answering to the class under which they fall; because if you be operating for
yourself in matters falling under the heads of love, friendship, etc., you should
absolutely name aloud the person, and move the Symbol. But if you name or 
operate for two other persons, whether it be for love or for hatred, you should
expressly name both, and move the Symbols answering to the classes under 
which they fall. Also, if it be possible, you can touch them with the Symbol,
whether it be general o r particular. Under this heading are included all classes
of goodwill, among the which the mosYt dicult by far is to make yourself 
 130 
belove d by religious persons. 
 Chapter XXI. ( To transform oneself, and take diVerent Faces and Forms.)
 In this Transmutation, which is rather a Fascination, the method of 
operating is as follows: Take the Symbol in your left hand, and with it stroke
your face. Now were it some (ordinary) Necromancer who was transformed by 
the working of some Diabolical Art, he would soon be discovered (by you). It
104 



--------------------------------------- 67

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
is certain, however, that if he who operateth be instructed in the True and 
 131 
Sacred Magic, like yourself, that h coule d produce noV eect upon you; 
because against the Grace of the Lord, by whomsoever received, no Operation 
can take eVect, whether for Good or for Evil; but should such be Diabolical 
Operations by express pacts and similar Sorceries, it is certain that you would 
soon bring them to shame. 
 Chapter XXII. (This Chapter is only for Evil, for with the Symbols herein 
we can cast Spells, and work every kind of Evil; we should not avail ourselves 
hereof.) 
 All these Symbols are to be either buried in the ground, or placed under 
doors, steps, or buried under paths and other places by which people do pass, 
or whereon they lean; in this latter case it Yis ciesunt merely to touch (such 
places) with the Symbol. It must be here remarked that we can work much evil 
against our enemies, and if you know for a certain fact that they are 
attempting your life, there is no imaginable sin in availing yourself of (these 
Symbols for protection). But should you do this to please some friend, you 
would not escape easily with impunit y from (the disapproval of ) your 
Guardian Angel. Use then this Knowledge as a Sword against your Enemies, 
but never against your neighbour, which would be without any result but that 
of bringing hurt to yourself. 
 Chapter XXVI. (To open every kind of Lock, without Key, and without 
making any noise.) 
 Should you wish to open anything locked, such as ordinary Locks 
 132 
(Bolts), Padlocks, CVoers, Cupboards, Boxes, and Doors, you shall touch 
them with the side of the Symbol which is written upon, and immediately 
they will open wi thout any noise, without being in any way damaged, and 
without exciting any suspicion of their having been broken open. When you 
wish to again close them, you shall touch them with the back of the Symbol, 
that is to say, with the part thereof not written upon, and at once they will 
refasten of their own accord. And in no way should this Operation be 
employed in Churches, or for the committing of Murder. Also (remember) 
that this Operation can be used for all manner of wicked ends; wherefore we 
should obtain (permissionWrst fro) m our Guardian Angel, so as not to irritate 
him, and abuse the Grace of God, which we have re ceived. Neither should this 
(Operation) be employed to aid in the commission of Rapes and Violation of 
Women; but only for (laudable) eVects, and other (permissible) ends. 
 The Child of whose services you avail yourself for the conclusion of this 
Operation should not be more than Seven Years of age; it should be able to 
speak clearly, it should be active, and should comprehend what you teach it to 
 105



--------------------------------------- 68

 The Sacred Magic
do, in order to serve you. And fear not that this Child may be able to reveal
and tell unto others anything of what he doeth; also he will not in the least
remember that which he shall hav e done, and you can make trial thereof
yourself by interrogating him a fter the seven days be past, and yoWndu will 
that he will be able to tell you nothing of that which hath passed; the which is
a very remarkable thing. 
 When you shall have thoroughly decided to give this present Operati on
unto any, and which should only be given as a free gift, as I have already said;
remember to make such person give you Seven Florins, the which you shall
distribute unto Seven poor persons with your own hand, and such poor
persons must genuinely be in want. Them shall you straitly charge, t o repeat
for Seven days the Seve n penitential Psalms, or the Pater and Ave seven times a
day, praying unto the Lord for the person who hath given Xor(the ins) unto
you to distrib ute unto them, that He would deign to come unto his assistance,
and to grant unto him for ever such s trength that he may never transgress His
Holy Commandments. 
 While in the performance of the Operation, be certain that each person
(undertaking the same) is subject unto very great temptations to prevarication,
and in particular unto great disq uietudes of mind, to force the abandonment
of the Operation. For the Mortal Enemy of Man is grieved that he should
make the acquisition of this Sacred Science, the which also he receiveth from
God Himself, Who hath by this means closed the way against Demthe on, this
being the only obje ct and end of this Sacred Science. For the Enchantments
whereof the Ev il Enchanters and Sorcerers make employ, are in no way
wrought by the true meth od, and they only have power to execute their end in
proportion to the Tributes, SaWcrices, and Pacts, rendered in return, which
latter evidently bring about the loss of the Soul, and very frequently that of the
Body as well. 
 Consider that it is the pride of (the Demon) which hath chased him out
of Heaven, and think what a heartbreaking thing it is for him to see a Man,
made of vile earth, command him who is a Spirit, and who was created noble,
and an Angel (as well); and also that it is necessar y that he should submit
himself unto Man, and obe y him, not of his own free will, but by force, and
by a power of command which God hath given unto Man, to whom he is
forced to humiliate himself, and to obey, he, who had the greatest Y culty indi
submitting himself unto his Creator. And yet, notwithstanding all this, he is
obliged by his most profound humiliation, and by his most sevVerinere sug, to
submit himself unto Man, for whom further is destined that Heaven which he
himself hath lost for an Eternity. 
 Wherefore you should continue the Operati on, and have recourse unto
the Lord, and in no way be troubled, for you shall vanquish evY cultery ydi,
seeing that the Lord neve r faileth those who put all their coWdencne in Him.
106 



--------------------------------------- 69

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 You may only give this Sacred Operation unto two persons; and in the 
case of your giving it unto a third, it would hold good for him, but you 
yourself would be for ever deprived of it. I beseech you in grace to well open 
your eyes, and thoroughly examine him unto whom you shall give so great a 
Treasure, so that he be not one who will make use of the same to make a mock 
of God, which is a sin so great, that we Jews are a living proof thereof. For 
since our predecessors began to make use of this Sacred Magic for Evil, God 
hath granted it unto so few among us, that in my whole lifetime, ourselves 
included, we be but the number of Seven persons who by the Grace of God 
possess the same. 
 When the Child shall w arn you that your Guardian Angel hath appeared, 
then shall you, without moving from your place, repeat in a low voice Psalm 
CXXXVII., which beginneth: “ConWtebor Tibi Domine, in toto corde mI eo,” 
will give thanks unto Thee, O Lord, with mine whole heart," etc. And, on the 
contrary, when you shall convoke forW the rst time the Four Chief Spirits, you 
shall say Psalm XC.“Q: ui habitat in adjutorio Altis simi," Whoso dwelleth in 
the defence of the Most High,” etc.; and this not in a low voice as in the 
preceding case, but (aloud) as you usually speak, and standing where you 
happen to be. 
 Chapter XXVIII. ( To have as much Gold and Silver as one may wish, 
both to provide for one's necessities, and to live in opulence.) 
 And whereas I have allowed the Twenty-eighth Chapter to pass without 
notice, I now refer here to. Place the Symbol of the Money you require in your 
purse, let it remain there for a short time, then put your right hand in your 
purse, and you will there Wnd Seven pieces of the class of Money which you 
have intended to obtain. But take heed to perform this Operation only thrice 
in the day. And the pieces of Money whereof you have no longer need will 
disappear at once. This is why when you have need of small change you should 
take heed at the same time no t to ask for large pieces. I could have here set 
down other values and Symbols, but I have only given those which I have 
found the most necessary for a beginner, and partly also to avoid confusing 
you. And also it is n ot right that I who am only a mortal man should give 
further instructions hereon unto you who are about to have an Angel for 
Master and for Guide. 
 We have already said that providing he recogniseth a God, any Man, of 
any Religion soever, may arrive at the possession of this Veritable Wisdom and 
Magic, if he employ right and pro per ways and means. Now I say further that 
 133 
unto whatever Law he who operateth may pertain, he can observe the feasts, 
etc., thereof, provided that they hinder not the Operation, wiWrm andth a 
true conviction that he shall have from his Angel greater lights as to the points 
 107



--------------------------------------- 70

 The Sacred Magic 
wherein he may be liable to err. Wherefore you shall be ready and willing to 
correct your faults, obedient in all things, and on all occasions, unto his 
precepts. And you should obser ve exactly and inviolably from point to point, 
everything touching the regimen of life, the practice, and other counsels given 
in this Book. 
 As we have already said, if by chance some slight indisposition should 
overtake you after the commencement of the Operation, you shall observe that 
hereinbefore laid down; but should the illness become very much worse, so 
that remedies become necessary unto the health of the body, and that you have 
to undergo blood-letting; then d o not harden yourself against the Will of the 
Lord, but having made a brief prayer, thank Him for having visited you in this 
manner. And having made use of remedies which oblige you toV leav thee o 
Operation already begun, so as not to become as it were your own murderer, 
and notwithstanding that it grieveth you to the heart to be forced so to do, yet 
nevertheless conform yourself unto His Holy Will. And when you shall have 
regained your accustomed health, in His own good time shall you return unto 
the Operation, feeling sure that He will grant you His aid. Such a forced 
desistance doth not hinder you from awaiting a Wtting time, when you may 
recommence; seeing that such interruption is not in any way voluntar y, but 
forced by necessity. Whereas, had this interruption occurred through pure 
caprice, you ought never to think further of (recommencing), because we must 
not make a Mock of God. 
 There be two kinds of sins which arWe innitely displeasing u nto God. One 
is Ingratitude, and the other Incredulity. I say this cursorily, because the Devil 
will not fail to insinuate a thousand ideas into your head (such as) that this 
Operation may perhaps be (a real thing) and perhaps not; that the symbols are 
badly drawn, etc., so as to make you comment upon the subject. This is why 
you must have Faith, and that you must believe. Neither should you dispute 
concerning that which you understand n ot; remember that God out of 
nothingness hath created all things, and that all things have their being in Him 
watch, work, and you will see. 
 In the Name of the Most HolAdy onai, the True and Only God, we have 
Wnished this Book in the best order and with the best instruction which has 
been possible to me. Know also that it is only in God that yoWund the will 
sole and cer tain Way to arrive at the True Wisdom and Magic, but yet also by 
following out that which I have written down in this Book with such 
exactitude. Still, however, when you shall have put anything into practice, you 
shall manifestly know how great and immeasurable hath been my paternal 
 134 
aVection; and in truth I dare to say that I have done for love of you what no 
one in our times hath undertaken, and in especial in that I have declared unto 
 135
you the two Symbols, that of the Child, and your own particular one, 
without the which I swear unto you by the True God that out of an hundred 
108 



--------------------------------------- 71

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
persons who might undertake this Operation, there would be only two or 
three who would actually attain unto it. I have, however, removed most of the 
diY culties, (therefore) be now tranquil, and despise not my counsel. 
 It need not appear strange unto you that this Book is not at all like unto 
so many others which I have, and which are composed in a lofty and subtle 
style; because I have composed this (work) expressly in order to spare you so 
much labour, and to enlighten therein the diY culties which you might 
(otherwise) have encountered in order to comprehend its meaning. And so 
that it might not be at all necessar y for it to pass into other hands (than your 
own), in making this Book I have in no way availed myself of eloquent but 
peculiar expressions, which those who write such works usually make use of 
and even then not without mystiWcations. But I have employed a certain 
manner of arrangement, making a mixtu re of the subject matter, and 
dispersing it here and there in the Chapters so that you may be forced to read 
and re-read the Book many times, and also the better so to do, to transcribe 
and imprint it in your memory. Render then your thanks unto the Lord God 
Almighty, and never forget my faithful advice, even unto the day of your 
death. Thus will the Divine Wisdom and Magic be your wealth, and never can 
you Wnd a greater Treasure in the World. Obey promptly him who teacheth 
you that which he hath learned by his own experience; and I pray and conjure 
you by that God Who is my God, to observe summarily and inviolably the 
three following heads which sho uld serve you as guides and limitations until 
you shall pass the gulf of this Miserable World: 
 (1) Let God, His Word, all His Commandments, and the Co unsel of your 
Angel, never depart from your heart and from your mind! 
 (2) Be the declared enemy of all the Evil Spirits, their Vassals, and 
Adherents, during the whole period of your life. Dominate them, and regard 
 136 
them as your Servitors. If they make propositions to you, demanding from 
you pacts, or sacriWces, or obedience, or servitude, refuse them with disdain 
and menaces. 
 (3) It is more than evident that God can know the heart of men, the 
which none else can do. You should therefore force yourself to test severely for 
some time him to whom you intend to give this (knowledge). You shall closely 
note his method of life and habits; you shall discuss the subject with him, 
seeking to discover in the clearest way and as far as possible, whether he would 
use it for Good or for Ev il. Also in giving this Operation you shall fast, eating 
only once a day, and he who shall receive it shall do the same; see also what we 
 137 
have said in the Third Chapter , and elsewhere. It is also true that one who 
would suVer much in health by fasting in such a manner, may if absolutely 
necessary supplement the same by paying one or several persons to fast in his 
 138 
stead and to intercede for him. (The whole object and end of ) this should be 
both to give and receive this operation unto the Glory of the Great God, and 
 109



--------------------------------------- 72

 The Sacred Magic 
unto one's own good and that of one's neighbour, whether friend or enemy, 
and unto that of all things created. 
 139 
 The Ten Florins of Gold shall be distributed by your own hands when 
you shall have received the money, unto Seventy-two poor persons who know 
the Psalms, as mentioned in a preceding Chapter; and see also that you fail not 
in this, for it is an essential point. 
 Furtherm ore you shall demand from him to whom you shall give the 
Operation, some pleasurable gratiWcation which is in harmony with the 
Operation, at your choice. But see that you demand not money, for for this 
you would be deprived entirely of the Holy Wisdom. 
 140 
 Every time that you shall desire to make a fresh comm yand, ou shall
thrice repeat the Psalm XC., “Qui habitat in adjutorium Altissimi,” etc., 
“Whoso dwelleth in the aid of the Most High,” etc., because this Psalm 
possesseth so great a virtue that you will be astonished when you comprehend 
it. 
 If you know that you, as a man, havVended e o your Creator, in anything
regarding the Tables of the Law; perform no operation until after having made 
a general confession of your sins unto God; the which you shall observe unto 
the day of your death. By thus acting the Mercy of the Lord will never depart 
from you. 
 Unto the which Lord be Praise, and Glory, and Honour, for the Gifts 
which He hath granted unto us. 
 So be it! 
 End of the Second Book

--------------------------------------- 73

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 Foo tnote s to th e Se cond B o ok 
 
1 
 The style of the writing here is much more quaint and obscure than that of the First Book; and is 
evidently the translation of Abraham the Jew from a more ancient writer. 
2 
 I.e., the Revelation, or Apocalypse. 
3 
 This whole passage about the siWcgniation of these numbers is very obsc urely worded in the original. 
I take the meaning to be the following: The Arts or methods of Magical working are twelve, if we class 
them under the twelve Signs of the Zodiac. The second number mentioned a bove, 5, is perfect 
because of its analogy with the Pentagram that potent Symbol of the Spirit and the Four Elements; 6 is 
the number of the Planets (as known to the Ancients, without the recently discovered Herschel and 
Neptune). As the Chaldean Oracles of Zoroaster say: " He made them Six, and for the Seventh, He 
cast into the midst thereof the Fire of the Su2 on". perates in the Stars and Planets as representing their
Good or Evil inXuence in the Heavens, in other words their dual nature. 3 consists in the Metals 
because, the ancient Alchemists considered their bases to be found in the three principlthes whey ich 
called Sulphur, Mercury, and Salt; but by which they did not mean the substance which we know 
under these names. 
4 
 Ie., “probabl as oe”pposed to “certain”. 
5 
 Ie., professing Magicians. 
6 
 In the original MS.: "Nouavs ons deja dit quelle est la science que je dois vous enseigner cest adire quelle
nest point humaine,et" c. 
7 
 Ibid. 
8 
 In the original: " Commjee suis apresent vous devez donc penser avant que d'entrbaerl," d eatns ce c. 
9 
 Ie., he who intends to undertake the Operation. 
10 
 I doubt this asser tion very much. 
11 
 Here comes another touch of prejudice. In the present day many of the profoundest students of the 
Qabalah are women, both married and single. 
12 
 It is necessary that the reader should not misunderstand this passage. What are meant are those 
Black Magic works containing garbled and perverted words and characters; and which teach nothing 
but hurtful and sWesl h practices; the great point in which is generally the forming of a Pact with an 
Evil Spirit. Because true Characters represent the Formulas of the Currents of the Hidden Forces of 
Nature and true Ceremonies are the Keys of bringing the same into action. 
13 
 It seems again to me here that Abraham the Jew stretches the matter too far. it is perfectly and 
utterly true without doubt that Angelic Magic is higher than that form of Talismanic Magic which has 
its basis in the Astrological positions of the Heavenly Bodies; and can therefore do more, and be also 
independent of Astrological considerations, because the matter is relegated to a higher plane than this' 
and one wherein the laws of Physical Nature do not obtain. But certainly when working with the rays 
of the Sun, we shall more easiWnlyd his occult force of heat attainable when he hi mself is producing 
that eVect upon the earth, i.e., when he is in the Sign of the Lion; while when he is in that of the Bull'
his force will be rather that of Germination, etc., when in the Northern Hemisphere. And the same 
with the other Planets. Also if working by the Indian Tatwas, weWnd i shatll necessary to consider the 
position of the Moon, the time in the day, and the course of the Tatwa in the peWverio Ghd of aris. Of 
 111 



--------------------------------------- 74

 The Sacred Magic 
 
course Abraharn could not make the experiments of Rabbin Moses succeed if he substituted the laws
of another plane for the ir own. 
14 
 So it would be if he applied it to the Angelic working; but equally it would be an error which,
though not so great, would still entail failure, to apply laws exclusively of the Angelic plane to those
experiments which would mainly depend on the physical rays of the Planets; though undoubtedly the
Angels of a Planet govern its rays. But the Angels of Mars do not govern the rays of Jupiter, nor those
of the latter the rays of Mars. 
15 
 The Grimoires of Black Magic would usually come under this head. But, nevertheless, the
extravagant words therein will be usually found to be corruptions and perversions of Hebrew, Chaldee,
and Egyptian titles of Gods and Angels. But it is undoubtedly evil to use caricatures of Holy Names;
and these for evil purposes also. Yet it is written in the Oracles of Zoroaster: “Change not barbarous
Names of Evocation, for they are Names Divine, having in the Sacred Rites a PVoablwer Ie!”ne
16 
 Yet, notwithstanding, it is well in a Sacred Magical Operation to employ a language which does not
to our minds convey so much the commonplace ideas of everyday life, so as the better to exalt our
thoughts. But, as Abraham says, we should before all unthindegrss tandwhat we are repeating.
17 
 The Passover is about the Vernal Equinox and nearly corresponds to our Easter; it begins on the
15th or 16th of the Jewish First Month= Nisan or Abib. The Feast of Tabernacles begins about the
middle of the ir Seventh Month= Tisri. 
18 
 Ie., religious denomination. 
19 
 It is immaterial whether the religious conception be Theistic or Pantheistic.
20 
 The Initiates of the True Rosicrucian Wisdom, know that there is a certain force in the observance
of the Equinoxes. 
21 
 Abraham evidently means his Guardian Angel. 
22 
 Here Abraham admits to an extent what I have urged in my previous notes. 
23 
 I.e., the Astrologers to whom Abraham refers inWr thst see ntence of the chapter.
24 
 I.e., the Moon and Monday; Sun and Sunday; Mars and Tuesday (Tuisco is a name of Mars); Venus
and Friday (Freya's day, after Freya, the Scandinavian Goddess), etc. 
25 
 “Et jusqua ceguil tremonte son jour dure jusqua cequil se leve derechef.”
26 
 This is the initiated Rosicrucian teaching, which is vVeeryre dnit to that of the outer and uninitiated
World. 
27 
 This is the great point to be s tudied in all Magical Operations soever, and unless the whole heart and
soul and faith go with the ceremony, there can be no reliable result produced.
28 
 The title of the Eleventh Chapter of the Second Book is: “Concerning the Selection of the Place”.
29 
 Meaning in the case where the Aspirant unto the Sacred Magic is a Servant actually then serving a
Master. 
30 
 The object of most of these instructions is of course to keep the Astral Sphere of the Aspirant free
from evil inXuences, and accustom him to pure and holy thoughts and to the exercise of Will power
and Self-control. The student of the Indian Tatwas will know the value of active meditation at Sunrise
because that moment is the AkAsic commencement of the Tatwic course in the day, and of the power
of the Swara. 
31 
 I.e., the Christians.

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 
32 
 This probably means in the bed-chambeforber e entering the Oratory. 
33 
 Que vous puissiez jouir et résistera la pr ésense, etc. 
34 
 I.e., independent. 
35 
 I.e, the ashes of the charcoal and incense. 
36 
 In the text evidently by a slip the wogranrd deuris repeatedla grandeur la grandeur de Dieu.
37 
 “Laissez apart touttes les choses curieuses.” 
38 
 This chapter is previously referred to in the Seventh Chapter in speaking of the Bed-chamber and
the Oratory. 
39 
 “L'avenue”; the modern sense of this word is, of course, a road or path bordered by trees. 
40 
 Compare the following description with that of Sir Philip Derval's so-called Observatory, in the
Strange Storyby Bulw, er Lytton. 
41 
 I.e., the Terrace or Balcony. 
42 
 I.e., the Spirits. 
43 
 I.e., the Altar. 
44 
 He here evidently means the Oratory, and not the Bedchamber described in Chapter VIl. 
45 
 The Rosicrucian Initiate will note the description of these vestments. 
46 
 “Mirrhe en larmes”

Anointing Oil and Perfume in Exodus xxx. 
48 
 Olibanum. 
49 
 Or storax. 
50 
 A “brasse” is a fathom; but here perhaps implies rather an arm's le“Lnune gth: brasse enveron ou demi
aulne”. 
51 
 I.e., in the hollow interior of the Altar. 
52 
 Which give the instructions for these periods. 
53 
 Concerning the two last Moons. 
54 
 It will be remarked how this point is insisted on. 
55 
 “Which,” apparently, should refer to the coals, and not to the censer. 
56 
 Preferably I should advise upon the Western side of the Altar, and facing therefore the East; also I
would have the cupboard opening upon the Western side, for certain mystical reasons. 
57 
 The place of the third eye in the IndWiguan res of Gods. 
58 
 This is apparently a slip for “the Seventh Chapter”; as the Third Chapter is only a short one
regarding those who arWtte ed to undertake the Operation. 
59 
 See Book I., Chapter X I I. 
60 
 Because previously when he has mentioned a foregoing chapter, it has been one of those in this
Second Book to which he has referred. 
61 
 If the Operator himself has developed the clairvoyant faculty; which the training he has subjected
himself to for six months o ugh t to have greatly aided, and be pure in mind, I can see no necessity for
the employment of a Child as Seer. 
62 
 I.e., your special and particular Guardian Angel. 
63 
 “En la familiarité et conversation delange.”

 The Sacred Magic 
 
64 
 I.e., those of a material force; many being evil, some few inclined to good, most of a mixed nature
somewhat good yet the evil predominating in their dispositions. 
65 
 I.e., this Second Book of the three constituting the treatise. 
66 
 I.e. the Red Robe, or Mantle. 
67 
 “Ou si vous estez en Campagne mettes vous ducosté, duThi ponant.” s word“p onan ist” almost obsolete
in modern French, being only employed in a nautical sense, and even then but rarely. It implies the
“West”, or rather the part of the “Ocean towards the West”. Even in the middle ages this expression
was not in wide use. The Occult student will remark here the idea of “turning to the East to pray, and
to the West to invoke”. But usually in Magic it is advisable to turn towards the quarter sympathetic in
nature with that of the Spirit you wish to summon. 
68 
 That is if you convoke them serto ve you. But all mediaeval tradition implies that they are ready
enough to come if you are an evil-minded person wishing to make a pact with them to obtain magical
force, i.e. a Goetic Magician as opposed to an Initiate Adept. 
69 
 This is why in religious and magical writings such stress is laid on the importance of controlling the
thoughts; which are as it were our prototypical speech and action in all matters of importance. Modern
thought-reading would alone suggest this to persons unskilled in Occultism. 
70 
 “Les Esprits jugent parla denostre ignoranse et serendent plus reveches Theet Inostinez.” itiate knows the
value of an Invocation written by himself, in harmony with and expressing exactly his will and idea.
But this does not deny the utility of many of the Conjurations handed down by tradition.
71 
 Yet the advantage of its being in a language which you do not immediately associate with the things
of every-day life is grepat,rov ided always that you understand the words and repeat them and pronounce
them correctly. 
72 
 This recalls the phrase so frequent in Conjurations, in which the Spirits are commanded to appear
“in human form without any deformity or tortuosity”. 
73 
 Because some of the Demonic forms are so terrible that the shock of their sight might cause a person
of a nervous te mperament to lose his reason. 
74 
 I must again repeat that it is only evil and perverted symbols which come under this denunciation of
Abraham the Jew; for nearly all Pentacles and Seals are the Symbols and Sigils of Divine and Angelic
Names. 
75 
 I.e., of allegiance to you. 
76 
 The four Superior Spirits and Princes are: Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan, and Belial.
77 
 The Eight Sub-Princes are: Astaroth, Magoth, Asmodeus, Beelzebuth; Oriens, Paimon, Ariton, and
Amaymon. 
78 
 By a very evident slip, “Chapitre IX.” is written in the MS. instead of XIX.
79 
 “Qui les asoumis atouttes ses Creatures et avos pied s.” 
80 
 This whole paragraph isY dculi t of clear translation by literal rendering, so I give the MS. text:
“Secondemenque vt ostrWen nest point cur iosité maligne mais alhonneur et gloire de Dieu et alutilité
propre et acelle de tout le genre humain et Pourtant tou tte cque veso Jus loises appellerez avec quelquesoit

 Of Abramelin the Mage

enleurplase aleurfaire preter le serment comme Jelay deja dit deparoitretc.e Tdahbort,” e writer of this
manuscript never uses the slightest punctuation, and paragraphs are infrequent. 
81 
 I.e., beyond the Door, but being careful not to go out on to the Terrace yourself. 
82 
 Written “Atarot” by a slip in the MS. 
83 
 I.e., upon the sand on the Terrace. 
84 
 Again erroneously“A tarot”. 
85 
 I.e., unto the subservient Spirits ofAstaroth. 
86 
 I.e., whether Verbal, or Mental, or by Gesture. 
87 
 Again note that the whole of the operations of this Magic of Abra-Melin and of Abraham the Jew
depends on these Symbols,so that it is not the true and sacred pentacles and symbols which he 
condemns; but erroneous and corrupted ones made use of ignorantly. 
88 
 If I.e., in those which the Operator has written down from the Third Book, and placed at the entry
of the Door for Astaroth to take oath upon. 
89 
 I.e., Servitors belonging equally to these two Sub-Princes together. 
90 
 I.e., Oriens, Paimon, Ariton, and Amaimon. Ariton is often called Egin or Egyn in other works on
Magic. 
91 
 I.e., following the order of the cWlassication in the Nineteenth Chapter of this Second Book.
92 
 I.e., Oriens, Paimon, Ariton, and Amaimon; one Spirit from each for a Familiar. 
93 
 Entitled: “How one may retain the Familiar Spirits, bound or free, in whatsoever form”. 
94 
 I.e., so that each of the four Familiars shall serve a fourth part of the twenty-four hours of the day,
that is six hours. 
95 
 However in all Magical Works great stress is laid on the importance of licensing a Spirit invoked in
the Operation to depart, and if he b e unwilling, of even compelling him against his will to return to
his place. It must be remembered here, in this Operation of Abraham the Jew, that not only his 
Oratory but his Bed-chamber also is kept pure and consecrated, and therefore it would be next to
impossible for an Evil Spirit to break through to attack him. But in all Magical Evocations by the
Circle,the Magician should never quit the same, without having licensed and even forced the Evil
Spirits to depar t; as cases are on record of the Operator experiencing sudden death. I myse lf was
present on an occasion when in the Evocation by the Circle, the Magician incautiously having stooped
forward and outward just over the limit of the Circle, received a sho ck like that from a powerful
electric battery, which nearly threw him down, struck the Magical Sword from his hand, and sent him
staggering back to the centre of the Circle. Compare also with this incident Allan Fenwick’s experience
in the Strange Story, when his hand accidentally went beyond the limits of the Circle when he was
replenishing the Lamps during the Evocation. 
96 
 Viz.: Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan, and Belial. 
97 
 I.e., the Demons and Evil Spirits generally. 
98 
 The Demons generally. 
99 
 in the original“d: emandes etapparitions”. 
 115



--------------------------------------- 78

 The Sacred Magic 
 
100 
 Let me here once again insist on the absolute necessity in Occult working ocourteous, f being even to
the Evil Spirits; for the Operator who is insolent and overbearing will speedily lay himself open to
obsession by a Spirit of like nature, the which will bring about his ultimate downfall, 
101 
 A similar name, “Buriol”, is given under the Spirits subservient to Amaymon. 
102 
 See same Name under Oriens. 
103 
 See same Name under Belzebud. 
104 
 In MS., "User d'humanité". 
105 
 Entitled: “How we may retain the Familiar Spirits bond or free, in whatsoever form”. 
106 
 Viz.: Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan, and Belial. 
107 
 Viz.: Ashtaroth, Maguth, Asmodeus, and Beelzebub; Oriens, Paymon, Ariton or Egyn, and 
Amaymon. 
108 
 For not only does constraining them to visible appearance require reiterated conjurations, but also
they must be in some way provided with the necessary elements wherefrom to build up a body to 
manifest in. 
109 
 In the Original"S: anspourtant crier comme unfou". 
110 
 I have by this phrase translated the expression in the OLerig ivicenal: de crapule. 
111 
 This also seems like mere prejudice on the part of Abraham. 
112 
 Remember that “this present day” means of course the period when Abraham was writing this 
work, ie., 1458 I.n this particular of curiosity the world has doubtless changed little since. 
113 
 Probably implying that the Evil Spirits could easily obsess such animal, so as to act upon the 
Operator through whatever he might eat of it. 
114 
 In the Original MS.: “Vousjuirez lejeu comme la peste parcequil occasionne toujours du blaspheme 
outreque dans ce temps la leveritable jeu est loraison et la lecture des ”. Blivryes “jsacreu,” hereze is
evidently meant gaming or gambling, and not simple recreation and amusement, which latter would 
be almost a necessity during this period, to prevent the brain giving way from the intense nervous 
strain. 
115 
 I.e., those of the Third Book. 
116 
 I have here interpolated “in all cases”, as otherwise this passage would clash with remarks elsewhere.
117 
 I.e., the Spirits, who have sworn allegiance to the Operator at his convocations of them. 
118 
 I.e., that Spirit. 
119 
 This Parenthesis is Abraham's. 
120 
 I.e., of this Second Book. The Chapter is entitled: “Concerning the Convocation of the Spirits”. 
121 
 I have thought it advisable to add here the headings of these chapters at length. 
122 
 Here again I am giving the headings of the Chapters of the Third Book at length; as by so doing 
they form a species of Key to the character, nature and oY ces of the Prince who governs their 
Operations. 
123 
 In addition to the chapters here given, Magoth is said to rule the operations of Chapter XIV. 
(Invisibility), in the special instructions of Abraham, the Jew, concerning that chapter. 
124 
 Notwithstanding these Numbers are here given, it will be found that the Instructions do not 
include all these Chapters, and, on the contrary, give information concerning some of those not here
specially mentioned. 
116 



--------------------------------------- 79

 Of Abramelin the Mage 
 
125 
 It is of course evident that the number Four of the Familiar Spirits = one for each of the Four
Elements of which Man is compose d, ruled by the Holy Name of Four Letters, IHVH, 
Tetragrammaton. 
126 
 I.e., the Evil. 
127 
 “Se resout”, in the MS. “Resoudre,” like our word “resolve,” also may imply to reduce to its chemical
constituents. These three parts of the person, which Abraham calls Body, Soul, and Spirit, are 
designated in the Qabalah by the respective terms of “Nephesch”, i.e., the animal part; “Neschamah”,
or the Soul, that is to say, the Higher Aspirations, and “Ruach,” ie., the Mind or Spirit. But besides
these, the Qabalists also recognise certain higher principles, of which Abraham the Je w does not here
speak, nor yet of the faculty of reincarnation of those principles. Reincarnation is a subject much
treated of by the Oriental Sacred writings, and was undoubtedly a fundamental doctrine of the 
Ancient Egyptian Magic, from which, be it well remembere d, the Hebrew Qabalah has been derived.
The Esoteric Buddhists divide the personality into Seven Principles, instead of the Three given above.
128 
 I.e., The Four Cardinal Points, 
129 
 the bandages. 
130 
 In the Original MS.“d, espersonnes religieuses”. This expression would include monks, nuns, and also
people bigoted in religion. 
131 
 I.e., such Evil Magician. 
132 
 “Serrures,” which implies bolts as well as locks. 
133 
 I.e., Religious denomination. 
134 
 Here Abraham the Jew is evidently especially addressing himself to his son Lamech. 
135 
 These two Symbols are probably those which are place d at the extreme end of the Third Book, ie.,
the Magical Squares with the NameAdsa m and Uriel returned therein, and of which the Squares of
numbers above are evidently intended for the reverse siAddes; am being applied to the Child, and
Uriel to the Guardian Angel of Lame ch. 
136 
 Again let the practical Occultist remember that this counse l applies principally to Adepts; for the
ordinary man can not command the Demons' seei ng that he has not yet learned to understand and 
control even all his thoughts; and the Adept can only command such beings through the knowledge of
his Higher Self, and of his Guardian Angel. 
137 
 I.e. of the Second Book. 
138 
 I think this system of substitution should be very rarely actised. He must be a very spiritless person
who would be dissuaded by the prospect of fasting for a day or two. 
139 
 Before alluded to in several places. 
140 
 This would apparently apply to a command given to the Demons, and not to an Aspirant for the
Sacred Wisdom.
