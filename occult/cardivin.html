 represent a lawyer; the King of Diamonds can represent an official of some
 kind.
   The cards have, of course, to be read in groups. The more they are used, 
 the more you find meanings in them, and the more deeply you will be able 
 to interpret them.
   An appropriate card is selected for the querant. A young man under about 
 thirty-five, with dark hair and blue or grey eyes, would be the Jack of Clubs.
 Card one is the querant. The cards are laid out as follows:


                         (3,8,13,18,23,28,33)
                        (1,2,7,12,17,22,27,32)
            (5,10,15,20,25,30,35)    (6,11,16,21,26,31,36)
                         (4,9,14,19,24,29,34)


   It will be seen that the cards are laid by putting number two card next 
 to the querant, then the third card is put in the top section, the fourth in
 the bottom section, the fifth in the left hand row, and the sixth in the 
 right hand row, then back to the middle row for card number seven, and so on,
 until all the cards are laid. The cards are shuffled by the querant before
 commencing, but after the querant card has been removed. They are generally
 laid face up, but if you want place them face down and flip as you read.
   The middle row, with the querant card in it, relates to the current situ-
 ation and describes events happening in the present.
   The left hand row is the past; the bottom row consists of environmental
 factors affecting the querant; the top row represents immediate probabilities 
 which may occure very soon; The right hand row concerns the future.
   Remember, the more you use these the easier they are to read and interpret,
 so practice and get used to them. A cool thing about this method is you don't 
 need special cards, or an abundance of occult knowledge. True the Tarot is 
 a bit more specific and can be read into alot easier, but this does work!
