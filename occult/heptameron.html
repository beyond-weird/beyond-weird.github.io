Heptameron: or, Magical Elements of Peter de Abano, philosopher 
In the former book, which is the fourth bo okA of grippa, it is sufficiently spoken concern- 
ing Magical Ceremonies, and Initiations. 
 But because he seemeth to have written to the learned, and well-experienced in this art; 
because he doth not specially treat of the Ceremonies, but rather speaketh of them in gen- 
eral, it was therefore thought good to adde hereunto the Magical ElemenPts of eter de 
A bano tha: t those who are hitherto ignorant, and have not tasted of Magical Supersti- 
tions, may have them in readiness, how they may exercise themselves therein. For we see 
in this book, as it were a certain introdiou n of Magical vanity; and, as if they were in 
present exercise, they may behold the dist fuin n ions of spirits, how they may be drawn 
to discourse and communication; what is to be done every day, and ever y hour; and how 
they shall be read, as if they were described sillable by sillable. 
 In brief, in this book are kept the principles of Magical conveyances. But because the 
greatest power is attributed to the Circles; (For they are certain fortresses to de fend the 
operators safe from the evil Spirits;) In the first place we will treat concerning the compo- 
sition of a Circle. 
 Of the Circle, and the Composition Thereof. 
 The for m of Circles is not alwaies one and the sa me; but useth to b e changed, accord- 
ing to the order of the S pirits that are to be called, their places, times, daies and hours. For 
in making a Circle, it ought to be considered in what time of the year, what day, and what 
hour, that you make the Circle; what S pirits you would call, to what S tar and Region they 
do belong, and what funions they have. Therefore let there be made three Circles of the 
latitude of nine foo t, and let them be distant one from another a hands breadth; and in the 
middle Circle, first, write the name of the hour wherein you do the work. In the second 
place, Write the name of the Angel of the hour. In the third place, The Sigil of the Angel 
of the hour. Four thly, The name of the Angel that ruleth that day wherein you do the 
work, and the names of his ministers. In the fifth place, The name of the present time. 
Sixthly, The name of the Spirits ruling in that part of time, and their Presidents. Sev- 
enthly, The name of the head of the S igne ruling in that part of time wherein you work. 
Eighthly, The name of the earth, according to that part of time wherein you work. Nin- 
thly, and for the compleating of the middle Circle, Write the name of the Sun and of the 
Moon, according to the said rule of time; for as the time is changed, so the names are to be 
altered. And in the outermost Circle, let there be drawn in the four Angles, the names of 
the presidential Angels of the Air, that day wherein you would do this work; to wit, the 
name of the King and his three Ministers. Without the Circle, in four Angles, letPen -

tagone bs e made. In the inner Circle let there be written four divine names with crosses 
interposed in the middle of the Circle; to wit, towards the East let there be wrAitlten pha, 
and towards the West let there be written Omega; and let a cross divide the middle of the 
Circle. When the Circle is thus finished, according to the rule now before written, you 
shall proceed. 
 Of the N ames of thHe ours, and theA ngels ruling them. 
 It is also to be known, that the Angels do rule the hours in a successive order, according 
to the course of the heavens, and Planets unto which they are s ; so that thatubje S pirit
which governeth the day, ruleth also the first hour of the day; the second from this gov- 
erneth the second hour ; the third; the third hour, and so consequentkly: and when seven 
Planets and hours have made their revolution, it returneth again to the first whi ch ruleth 
the day. Therefore we shall first speak of the names of the hou rs. 
 Hours of the day. Hours of the night. 
 1. Yayn. 1. Beron. 
 2. Janor. 2. Barol. 
 3. Nasnia. 3. Thanu.

 9. Neron. 9. Sassur. 
 10. Jayon. 10. Aglo. 
 11. Abai. 11. Calerna. 
 12. Natalon. 12. Salam. 
 Of the names of the Angels and their S igils, it shall be spoken in their proper places. 
Now let us take a view of the name s of the times. A year therefore is fourfold, and is 
divided into the S pring, Summer, Harvest and Winter; the names whereof are these. 
 The Spring. Talvi. 
 The Summer. Casmaran. 
 Autumne. Ardarae.l 
 Winter. Farlas.

 When the Circle is ritely pe rfe ed, s prinkle t he same with h oly or p urging water, and 
say, Thou shalt purge me with hysop, (O Lord,) and I shall be clea n: Thou shalt wash me, and I
shall be whiter then snow.

 T he God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, bless here the creatures of these kindes , that

 Of the Garment and Pentacle. 
 Let it be a Priests Garment, if it can be had, let it be of linen, and clean. Then take this 
Pentacle made in the day and hour oMercuf ry, the Moon increasing, written in parchment 
made of a kids skin. But first let there be said over it the Mass of the holy Ghost, and let it 
be sprinkled with water of baptism. 
 An Oration to be said, when the Vesture is put on. 
 A ncor, Amacor, Amides, Theodonias, Anitor, by the merits of thy Angel, O Lord, I will put on 
the Garments of Salvation, that this which I desire I may bring t: thro eoffeugh thee the most 
holy Adonay, whose kingdom endureth for ever and ever. Amen. 
 Of the manner of working. 
 Let the Moon be increasing and equal, if it may then be done, and let her not be com- 
bust. 
 The Operator ought to be clean and purified by the space of nine daies before the 
beginning of the work, and to be confessed, and receive the holy Communion. Let him 
have ready the perfume appropriated to the da y wherein he would perform the work. He 
ought also to have hol y water from a Priest, and a new earthen vessel with fire, a Vesture 
and a Pentacle; and let all these things be rightly and duly consecrated and prepared. L et 
one of the servants carry the earthen vessel full of fire, and the perfumes, and let another 
bear the book, another the Garment and Pentacle, and let the master carr y the Sword;

 over which there must be said one mass of the Holy Ghost; and on the middle of the
 Sword, let there be written this nameAg la +, and on the other side thereof, this name +
 On +. And as he goeth to the consecrated p lace, let him continually read Letanies, the ser-
 vants answer ing. And when he cometh to the place where he wil thel ere Circle, let him
 draw the lines of the Circle, as we have before taught: and after he hath made it, let him
 sprinkle the Circle with holy water, sayinAgs,perg es me DomineWa,sh me O Lord,
 &c. [ Wash me O Lord, 
 The Master therefore ought to be purified w ith fasting, chastity, and abstinency from
 all luxury the space of three whole dayes before the day of the operation. And on the day
 that he would do the work, being clothed with pure garments, and furnished with Penta-
 cles, Perfumes, and other things necessary hereunto, let him enter the Circle, and call the
 Angels from the four parts of the wor ld, which do govern the seven Planets the sev en
 dayes of the week, Colours and Metals; whose name you shall see in their places. And with
 bended knees invocating the said Angels particularly, let himO A say,n gels supradii, estote

 These things being performed, let him read the Conjur ation assigned for the day
 wherein he maketh the experiments, as we have before spoken; but if they shall be partina-

 assigned to the day, nor to the prayers before made, then use the Conjurations and Ex or-

 But that you may the better know the manner of composing a Circle, I will set down 
one Scheme; so that if any one would make a Circle in Spring-time for the first hour of 
Lords day, it must be in the same manner as is the figure following.

 The Spirits of the Air of the Lords day, are under the North-winde; their nature is to 
procure Gold, Gemmes, Carbuncles, Riches; to cause one to obtain favour and benevo-

mities. But in what manner they appear, it's spoken already in the former book of Magical

 But this is to be observed by the way, that the first hour of the day, of ever y Country, 
and in every season whatsoever, is to be assigned to the Sun-rising, when he first appe- 
areth arising in the horizon: and the first hour of the night is to be the thir teenth hour, 
from the first hour of the day. But of these things it is sufficiently spoken.
