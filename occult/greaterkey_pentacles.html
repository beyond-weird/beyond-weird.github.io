 SATURN. 
 Figures 11 and 12. 
 Figure 11. The First Pentacle of Saturn . – This Pent acle is of great value and
ut ility for s triking te rror into t he Spirits. Wherefore, upon its being s hown to th em
they submit, and kneeling upon the earth before it, they obey. 
 Editor’s Note–. The Hebrew Letters within the square are the four great Names of
God w hich a re written with four lette–rs Y: HVH, Yod, He, Vau, He; ADNI , Adonai;
IIAI, Yiai (this Name has the same Numerical value in Hebrew as the Name EL); and
AHIH, Eheieh. Th e Hebrew versicle which surrounds it is from Psa lm lxxii 9 ; " The
Ethiopians shall kneel before Him, His enemies shall lick the dust."
 Figure 12. The Second P entacle o f Saturn . – Th is Penta cle is of grea t value
against adversaries; and of especial use in repressing the pride of the Spirits.
 Editor’s Note .– This is the celebrated 
 S A T O R 
 A R E P O 
 T E N E T 
 O P E R A 
 R O T A S, 
 the most perfect existing form of double acrostic, as far as the arrangement of the
letters is concerned; it is repeatedly mentioned in the records of medieval Ma gic; and,
save to very few, its derivation from the present Pentacle ha s been unknown. It will be
seen at a gla nce th at it is a square of five, giving twenty-five letters, which, adde d to
the unity, g ives twenty-Six, the numeric al v alue of I HVH. The Hebrew versicle sur-
rounding it is taken from Psalm lxxii 8, "His dominion shall be also from the one sea
to th e o ther, and f rom the flood unto the world’s e nd. This passage cons ists also of
exactly twenty-five letters, and its total numerical value (considering final letters with
increased numbers), a dded to that of the Name Elohim, is exactly equal to the total
numerical value of the twenty-five letters in the Square.

 The Holy Pentacles 
 Figures 13 and 14. 
 Figure 13. The Third Pentacle of Saturn . – This should be made w ithin the
Ma gical Circle, and it is good for use at nig ht when thou invokest the Spirits o f the 
nature of Saturn. 
 Editor’s Note. – The ch aracters at the ends of the r ays of the Mystic Wheel are 
Magical Characters of Sat urn. Surrounding it are the Names of the Angels: Omeliel, 
Anachiel, Arauchiah, and Anazachia, written in Hebrew. 
 Figure 14. The Fourth Pentacle of Saturn . – This Pentacle serveth principally
for executing all the experiments and operations of ruin, destruction, and death. And 
when it is made in full perfection, it ser veth also for those Spirits which br ing news, 
when thou invokest them from the side of the South. 
 Editor’s Note–. The Hebrew words around the sides of the triangle are from Deut. 
vi.4:– "Hear, O Israel, IHVH ALHINVH is IHVH ACHD." The surrounding versicle is 
from Psalm cix. 18:– "As he clothed himself w ith cursing like as with a garment, so let 
it come u nto his bowels like water, and li ke o il into his bones." In the center of the 
Pentacle is the mystic letter Yod. 
 Figure 15. The Fifth Pentacle of Saturn . – This Pentacle defendeth those who
invoke the Spirits of Sat urn d ur ing the n ig ht; an d chaseth away the Sp irits whi ch 
guard treasures. 
 Editor ’s Note–. T he Hebrew l etter s in the a ngles of the C ross are t hose of t he 
Name IHVH. Those in the Angles of the Square form ALVH, Eloah. Round the four 
sides of the Square are the Names of the An–ge Alsr:ehanah, Rakhaniel, Roelhaiphar, 
and Noaphiel. The versicle is: "A Great God, a Mighty, and a Terr–i Dble."eut x. 17.

 Figures 15 and 16. 
 Figure 16. The Sixth Pentacle of Saturn . – Around this Pentacle is each Name
symbolized as it should be. The person against whom thou shalt pronounce it shall
be obsessed by Demons. 
 Editor’s Note–. It is formed from Mystical Characters of Saturn. Around it is writ-
ten in Hebrew: "S et thou a wicked one to be ruler over him, and let Satan stand at his
right hand." 
 Figure 17. The Seventh and Last Pentacle of Saturn . – This Pentacle is fit for
exciting ear thquakes, seeing that the power of each order of Angels herein invoked is
sufficient to make the whole Universe tremble.

 Editor’s Note–. Within the Pentacle are the Names of the Nine Orders of Angels, 
those of six of them in ordinar y Hebrew Characters, and the remainder in the le tters 
which are known as "the Passing of the River." These Nine Order–s 1, ar Ce:HAIATH

 JUPITER. 
 Figures 18 and 19. 
 Figure 18. The First Pentacle of Jupiter . – This serveth to invoke the Spirits of
Jupiter, an d esp ecially those whos e Names are w ritten around the Pentac le, among
whom Parasiel is the Lord and Master of Treasures, and teacheth how to become pos-
sessor of places wherein they are. 
 Edit or ’s Note–. Th is Penta cle i s comp osed o f Mystica l C ha ra cters of Jupit er.
Ar oun d i t ar e the N a me s of th e Angel– Ns: e toniel , D evach iah, Tzed e qi ah, an d
Para siel, written in Hebrew. 
 Fig ure 19. T he Secon d Pen tacle of Jupiter . – This is proper for a cquirin g
glor y, honors, dignities, riches, and all kinds of good, together with great tranquillity
of mind; also to discover Treasures and chase away the Spirits who preside over them.
It should b e writte n upon Virgin P archment, with the pen of th e swallow and the
blood of the screech-owl. 
 Editor’s Note–. In the center of the Hexagram are the letter s of the Name AHIH,
Eheieh; in the upper and lower angles of the same, those of the Name AB, the Father;
in the remaining an gles t hose of t he Name IH VH. I bel iev e the letters out side the
Hexagram in the reentering angles to be intended for those o f the first two words of
the Versicle, which is taken from Psalm cxi–i. " 3W: ealth and Riches are in his hous e,
and his righteousness endureth for ever." 
 Figure 20. The Third Pentacle of Jupiter . – Th is d efende th and protecte th
those who invoke and cause the Spirits to come. When they appear show unto them
this Pentacle and immediately they will obey. 
 Editor ’s Note–. In the u pper left hand corner is the Magical Seal o f Jupite r with
the letters of the Name IHVH. In the others are the Seal of the Intelligence of Jupiter,
Page 64

 The Holy Pentacles 
 Figures 20 and 21. 
and the Names Adonai and IHVH. Around it i s the Versicle from Psalm cxx–v "A. 1: 
Song of degrees . They that t rust in I HVH sha ll be a s Mount Zion, which ca nnot b e 
removed, but abidet h for ever." 
 Figure 21. The Fourth Pentacle of Jupiter . – It serveth to acquire riches and
honor, and to posses s much wealth. Its Angel i s Bariel. It should be engraved upon 
silver in the day and hour of Jupiter when he is in the Sign Cancer. 
 Editor ’s Note–. Above the Magi cal Si gil is the Name IH , Iah. Below i t are t he 
Names of the Angels Adoniel and Bariel, the letters of the latter being arranged about 
a square of four compar tments. Around is the Versicle from Psalm cx–i "Wi. 3:ealth 
and Riches are in his house, and his righteousness endureth for ever." 
 Figure 22. T he F ifth P entacle of Jupiter . – Th is hath great power. It serveth
for assu red visions. Ja cob being armed wit h this Pentacle beheld the ladder which 
reached unto heaven. 
 Editor’s Note–. The Hebrew letters within the Pentacle are taken from the five last 
words of th e versicle which surrounds it, ea ch of w hic h contains five letters. These 
are, then , recombined so as to for m certain Mystical Names. The versicle is taken 
from E zekiel i. 1–: "As I was amon g the captives by the river of Cheba r, the heavens 
were open ed, and I s aw vi sion s of Elohim." I n my opinion the versicle should only 
consist of the five last words thereof, when the anachronism of Jacob using a Pentacle 
with a sentence from Ezekiel will not longer exist. 
 Figure 23. The Sixth Pentacle of Jupiter . – It ser veth for protec tion against all
earthly dangers, by regarding it each day devoutedly and repeating the versicle which 
surroundeth it. "Thus shalt thou never perish."

 The Key of Solomon 
 Figures 22 and 23. 
 Editor’s Note–. The four Nam es i n the Arms of t he Cross are:- Seraph, Kerub,
Ariel, and Tharsis; the four rulers of the Elements. The versicle is from Psalm xxii 16,
17:– "They pierced my hands and my feet, I may tell all my bones." 
 Figure 24. The Seventh and last P entacle of Jupiter . – It hath great power
against poverty, if thou considerest it with devotion, repeating the versicle. It serveth
fur ther more to d rive a way those Spir its who guar d treasu res, an d to discover the
same. 
 Editor’s Note–. Myst ical Char acters of J upiter with the ver–s "Le: ift ing up the
poor o ut of th e mire , a nd ra ising th e needy f rom the dung hill, that h e may set h im
with princes, even with the princes of his peop– Ple."sa lm cxiii. 7.

 MARS. 
 Figures 25 and 26. 
 Figure 25. The First P entacle of Mars . – It is proper for invokin g Spirits o f
the Nature of Mars, especially those which are written in the Pentacle. 
 Editor’s Note–. Mystical Characters of Mars, and the Names of the four Ange– ls: 
Madimiel, Bartzachiah, Eschiel, and Ithuriel written in Hebrew around the Pentacle. 
 Figure 26. The Second Pentacle of Mars . – Th is Penta cle serveth with great
success against all kinds of diseases, if it be applied unto the afflicted part. 
 Editor’s Note–. The letter Hé, in the ang les of the Hexag ram. Within the same the 
Na mes IH VH, IH ShV H Yeheshuah (t he m ystic Hebr ew Na me for Joshua or Jesus, 
formed of the ordinary IHVH with the letter Sh placed therein as emblematical of the 
Spirit ), and Elohim. Around it is the sentence, John i–. " 4In: Him was lif e, and the 
life was the light of man." This may be adduced as an argument of the greater antiq- 
uity of the first few mystical verses of the Gospel of St. John. 
 Figure 27. The Third Pentacle of Mars . – It is of great value for exciting war,
wrath, d iscord, and hostility; also for resisting enemies, and striking terror into rebel- 
lious Spirits; the Names of God the All Powerful are therein expressly marked. 
 Editor’s Note–. The Letters of the Names Eloah and Shaddai. In the Center is the 
great letter Vau, the signature of the Qabalistic Microprosopus. Around is the versicle 
from Psalm lxxvii 13–. "Who is so great a God as our Elohim?" 
 Figure 28. The Fourth Pentacle of Mars . – It is of g reat virtu e and po wer in
war, wherefore without doubt it will give thee victory.

the Name I HVH; a bove and below, EL. Round it is the vers icle from Psalm c–x. 5:
"The Lord at thy right hand shall wound even Kings in the day of His Wrath."
 Figure 29. The Fifth Pentacle of Mars . – Write thou this P entacle upon Vir-
gin Parchment, because it is terrible unto the Demons, and at its sight and aspect they
will obey thee, for they cannot resist its presence. 
 Editor’s Note–. Around the figure of the Scorpion is the word HVL. The versicle
is from Psalm xci. 1–3": Thou shalt go upon the lion and added, the young lion and
the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet." 
 Figure 30. The Sixth Pen tacle of Mars . – It hath so great vir tue that be ing
armed th erewith, if thou art attacked by any one, thou shalt neith er be injured nor
wounded when thou fightest with him, and his own weapons shall turn against him.
 Editor’s Note–. Around the eight points of t he radii of the Pentacle are the words
"Elohim qeber, Elohim hath covered (or protected)," written in the Secret Alphabet of
Mala chim, or the writing of the Angels. The versicle is from Psalm xxxv–ii."T 1he5ir:
sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bow shall be broken." 
 Figure 31. The Seventh and Last Pentacle of Mars . – w rite thou th is upon
Virgin Pa rchment Pa per with the blood o f a b at, in the day and hour of Ma rs; and

cially those which are written in the whose Names are therein written; and thou shalt
immediately see ha il and tempest.

 THE SUN. 
 Figures 32 and 33. 
 Figure 32. The First Pentacle of the Sun . – The Countenance of Shaddai the
Almighty, at whose aspect all creatures obe y, and the Angelic Spirits do reverence on
bended knees. 
 Editor’s Note–. This singular Pentacle contains the head of the great Angel Meth-
raton or Metatron, t he vi ce-regent an d repres entative of Sh addai, who is called the
Prince of Countenances, and the right-hand masculine Cherub of the Ark, as San dal-
phon is the left and fe minine. O n e ither side is the Name "E l S haddai." A round is
written i n Latin:– "B ehold H is fa ce and form by Whom all things were made, and
Whom all creatures obey." 
 Figure 33. The S econd Pentacle of the Sun . – This Pentacle, and the preced-
ing and following, belong to the na tu re of the Sun. They serve to repress the pr ide
and arrogance of the So lar Spirits, which are al together proud and ar roga nt by t heir
nature. 
 Editor ’s Note–. Mystical charac ters of t he Sun an d the Nam es of the An–ge ls:
Shemeshiel, Paimoniah, Rekhodiah, and Malkhiel. 
 Figure 34. The Third Pentacle of the Sun . – This serveth in addition (to the
effects of the two preceding) to acquire Kingdom and Empire, to inflict loss, and to
acquire renown and glor y, especially through the Nam e o f God , Tetr agrammat on,
which therein is twelve times contained. 
 Editor’s Note–. The Name IHVH, twelve times repeated; and a versicle somewhat
similar to Daniel iv. 34:– "My Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and my dominion
endureth from age to age." 
Page 70

 The Holy Pentacles 
 Figures 34 and 35. 
 Figure 35. The Fourth Pentacle of the Sun . – This s erveth to enable thee to
see the Spirits when they appear invisible unto those who invoke them; because, when 
thou hast uncovered it, they will immediately appear visible. 
 Editor’s Note–. The Names IHVH, Adonai, are written in the center in Hebrew; 
and round the radii in the mystical characters of the "Passing of the River." The versi- 
cle is from P salm xiii. 3,4: -"Lighten mi ne e yes t hat I sl eep not in d eath, l est mine 
enemy say, I have prevailed against him." 
 Figure 36. The Fifth Pentacle of the Sun. – It serveth to invoke those Spirits
who can transpor t thee from one place unto another, over a long distance and in short 
time. 
 Editor’s Note–. Characters in the "Passing of the River" Alphabet, forming Spirit’s 
Names. The Versicle is from Psalm xci. 11, 12:– "He shall give His Angels charge over 
thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands." 
 Figure 37. The Sixth Pentacle of the Sun . – It serveth excellently for the oper-
ation of invisibility, when correctly made. 
 Editor’s Note–. In the center is the Mystical letter Yod, in the Celestial Al phabet. 
The th ree lette rs in the "Passing o f th e Riv er" writing , in th e Angles of the tr iangle,
form the great Name Shaddai. The words in the same characters round its t hree sides 
are, in my opinion, from Genesis i.– 1 "I: n th e b eginning the E lohim created, etc."; 
but the characters are sadly mangled in the MSS. The versicle is from Psalms lxix. 23, 
and cxxxv. 16–: "L et their eyes be da rkened that they see not; and make their l oins 
continually to shake. They have eyes and see not."

should b e engraved in Gold o n the day and h our of the Sun, he will be immediately
delivered and set at liberty. 
 Editor’s Note–. On the Arms of the Cross are written the Names of Chasan, Angel
of Air ; Ar el, An gel of Fire; P horlakh, An gel of E arth; an d Taliahad, An gel of water.
Between the four Arms of the Cross are written the names of the Four Rulers of the
Elemen ts; Ariel, Se raph, Tharshis, and Cherub. T he versicle i s from Psalm cxvi. 16,
17:– "T hou hast b roken my bonds in sun der. I wi ll of fer unto thee the sacrifice of
thanksgiving, and will call upon the Name of IHVH."

 Figure 40. The Second Pentacle of Venus . – These Pentacles are also proper 
for o bta ining grace and honor, and for all things which belong unto Venus, and for 
accomplishing all thy desires herein. 
 Editor ’s Note–. T he l etters r ound and wi thin the P entac le form t he Na mes of 
Spirits of Venus. The versicle is from Canticles viii 6:-"Place me as a signet upon thine 
heart, as a signet upon thine arm, for love is strong as death." 
 Figure 41. The Third Pentacle o f Venus . – This, if it be only show n unto any
person, serveth to attract love. Its Angel Monachiel should be invoked in the day and 
hour of Venus, at one o’clock or at eight. 
 Edit or ’s Note–. Th e f ollow ing Names are w r itte n w ithin the Fig–u IHre: VH, 
Adon ai, Ruach , Achides, Aegalm iel, Monach iel, an d Degaliel. The vers icle i s from 
Genesis i. 28:– "And the Elohim blessed them, and the Elohim said unto them, Be ye 
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the ear th, and subdue it." 
 Figure 42. The Fourth Pentacle of Venus . – It is of great power, since it com-
pels the S pirits of Venus to obey, and to force on the instant any person thou wishest 
to come unto thee. 
 Editor’s Note–. At the fou r Angles of the Figure are the four letters of the Na me 
IHVH. The other letters form the Names of Spirits of Venus, e– .Sgc.:hii, Eli, Ayib,

two ot her Names wh ich I c a nnot d eci pher, an d have, t herefore, gi ven them as they

 Editor’s Note–. In the center is the Name of God, EL The Hebrew letters inscribed 
about the dodecagram make the sentence, "IHVH, fix Thou the Volatile, and let there 
be unto the void restriction." Th e versicle– is " W: isdom and virtue are i n his house,
