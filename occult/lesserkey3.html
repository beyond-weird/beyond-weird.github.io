 The nature of the 24 Angels of the Day & Night changeth every day & their 
offices is to do all things that is attributed to the 7 Planets but that changeth every 
day also, as for example, you ma y see in the following treatise is that the Angel 
Samael ruleth the first hour of the day beginning at Sun Rising, supposing it to be 
on a Monday, in the first hour of the day that is attributed to the Moon, and you call 
Samael or any of his Dukes, their offices in that hour is to do all things that is attrib- 
uted to the Moon but if you call him or any of his servants D ukes on a Tuesday 
morning at Sunrising being the first hour of the Day their offices is to do all things 
that is attributed to Mars & so the like rule is to be obser ved in the first hour of 
every day & the like is to be observed of the Angels & their servants that ruleth any 
of the other hours either in the Day or Night, also again there is an observation 
(rule) to be obser ved in making the seals of the 24 Angels, according to the time of

 Ars Paulina 
The Second part of this Book of Solomon of the Art of Pauline, is 
 as followeth: 
 This second part contains the Mystical names of the Angels of the Signs in 
general & also the Angels of ever y degree of the signs in general, which is called the 
Angels of men, because that in some one of these signs & degrees every man is born 
in, theref ore he that knows the minutes of his birth, he may know the name of the 
Angel that governs him, & thereby he may attain to All Ar ts & Sciences yea, to all 
the wisdom & knowledge that any mortal man can desire in this world. But note 
this, that these Angels that are attributed to the fire hath more knowledge therein 
than any other, and those of the water hath more knowledge therein than any other, 
and also those of the earth hath knowledge therein than any other, and likewise 
those of the air. And to know which belongs to the fire, earth, air & water, observe 
the nature of the signs & you cannot err, for those that is attributed Aries is of the 
same nature Fiery, & so the like in the rest, but if any planet be in that degree that 
ascends, then that Angel is of the nature of the sign & planet both, & observe the 
following method & you cannot but obtain your desire &c.

 So when you know the Angel that governs the sign & degree of your Nativity 
& having the seal ready that belongs to that sign & degree as is showed before, then
you are next to understand what order he is of, as is showed herein the following
part. 
 First these genijs that belong to the Fiery Region, that i
s   and gov- 
erned by Michael the great Angel who is one of the Chief Messenge rs of God, who 
is toward the South, therefore these genijs are to be obser ved in the first hour of a
Sunday & at the 8th. hour, also at the 3rd. & 10th. at night, directing yourself 
toward that quarter, they appear in Royal Apparel holding scepters in their hands,
and riding on a Lyon or a Cock, their robes are of red & saffron color & most 
comely, they assume the shape Crowned Queen & very beautiful to behold. 
 S econdly these genijs that are attributed to   &  are of the Earthly 
Regions & are governed by Vriel who hath 3 Princes to attend him (viz) Asaiel, 
Sochiel & Cassiel. Therefore the genijs that are Attri buted to him & these signs are
to be obse rved in the West. They appear like Kings, having green & silver robes, or
like little children or women delighting in hunting, & they are to be observed on
Saturday in the 1st. & 8th. hours of the day & the 3rd. & 10th. of the night, in those
hours you are with privacy to obtain your desires directing yourself towards the west
as aforesaid. 
 Thirdly those genijs that are attributed to   &  are of the Airy Region 
whose soverign is called Raphiel, who hath under him 2 princes called Seraphiel &
Miel. Therefore these genijs are attributed to him & those signs are to be observed
towards the East, on a Wednesday the 1st. hour of the day & 8th., at night the 3rd.
& 10th. hours. They appear as Kings or beautiful young men in robes of diverse col-
ors but mostly like women transcendently handsome by reason of their admirable 
whiteness & beauty. 
 Fourthly & lastly, these genijs that are attr ibuted to   &  are of the 
Watery Regions & are governed by Gabriel who hath under him S amael, Madie l & 
Mael. Therefore these Genijs that a re under these signs & are governed by Gabriel
are to be observed on Mondays, towards the North at the 1st. & 8th. hours of the 
day & at night at the 3rd. & 10th. hours. They appear like Kings having green & sil-
ver robes or like little children or women delighting in hunting. 
 S o in the next place, we are to observe the season of the year according to the
constellations of the Celestial Bodies, otherwise we shall loose our labor, for if a
genijs be of the Igneal Hiera rchy its in va in to observe him in any other season but
when the enters these signs which is of his nature, tha
t i s &  . So if it be a
genij of the Earth, he is to be obser ved when the en ters   &  , & so the like
in the rest. Other wise thus: those genijs that are of the order of Fire are to be
observed in the Summer Quarter & those of the Earth in Autumn, those of the Air 
in Spring, & those of the Water in Winter quarter. Their offices is to do all things
that are just & lawful in the sight of the great God Jehovah & what is for our good
& what shall concern the protection of our lives or beings or wellbeings & the doing
good to our neighbors. 
20 



--------------------------------------- 21

 Ars Paulina 
 Now he that hath a desire to see his genijs ought to prepare himself accordingly. 
Now if his genijs be of the Fire, his demands must be for the conservation of his 
body or person, that he receive no hurt from or by any fire, arms or guns or the like. 
& having a seal suitable ready prepared he is to wear it when he hath a desire to see 
his genijs that he may confirm it to him, that for the time to come he may not fail of 
his assistance & protection upon any occasion. But if his genijs be Aireal, he reconci- 
leth mens natures, increaseth love & affection between them & causeth the desired 
love of Kings & Princes & secretly promotes Marriages. & therefore he that hath 
such a genius before he observes him shall prepare a seal suitable to his order, that he 
may have it confirmed by him in the day & hour of observation, w hereof he shall see 
strange & wonderful effects. & so the like of the other 2 hierarchies. 
 & when the time is come that you would see your genijs, turn your face to that 
qua rter the sign there is. & that, with prayer to God (they being composed to your 
fancy but suitable to the matter at hand) there thou shalt find him & having found 
him, sincerely acknowledge him, do your duty. Then will he, as being benign & 
sociable, illuminate your mind, taking away all that is obscure & dark in thy memor y 
& make you knowing in all Sciences sacred & divine in an instant. 
 [Below is] A form of prayer which ought to be said upon that coast or quarter 
where the genijs is several times, it being an Exorcism to call the genij into the Crys- 
tal S tone. Note this prayer may be altered to the mind of the worker, for it is here 
sett for an example. 
 The Prayer 
 “O thou great & b lessedN m y Angel Guardian, vouchsafe to descend from thy Holy 
mansion which is Celestial with thy holy influence & presence into this C rystal Stone, that 
I may behold thy glor y & enjoy thy society, Aid & Assistance both now & forever hereafter, 
O thou that art h igher than the 4th. heaven & knowest the sEelacnelrets of , thou that rid- 
est upon the wings of the wind & art mighty & potent in thy Celestial & supersublunary 
motion, do thou descend & be present I pray thee, I humbly desire & Int reat thee that if 
ever I have merited thy society or if any of my actions or intentions be real & pure & sanc- 
tified before thee, bring thy external presence hither & converse with me, one of thy submis- 
sive pupils, in & by the name of the greaJet Gohovad h, whereunto the whole choir of 
heaven sings continuaOlly A lappa-la-man Hallelujah, Amen.” 
 When you have said this prayer over several times, as occasion ser veth, you will 
at last see strange lights & passages in the stone & at last you will see your genius, 
then give him a kind entertainment as you were before directed, declaring unto him 
your mind & what you would have done. 
 So Endeth The Book Pauline

 Le megeton: Clavicula Salomonis
 Afte rword by the Editor
The text and diagrams of this book were taken directly from a copy of Sloane Manu-
script 2731. The handwriting in this section was small and cramped, even in com-
pa rison with the rest of the manuscript. It is very difficult to distinguish between the
copyist’s "o", "e", and "a"; thus there is some variation from other published editions
in the names of various angels. They are as accurate as I can make them, given the
state of the original materia ls. Punctuation marks and capitalization are virtua lly
non-existent in the manuscript, particularly in the parts describing the individual
angels and their subordinates. The punctuation in this edition represents my own
best guess as to how the run-on strings of words are divided into sentences.
 The Ars Paulina is, in one way, the most sophisticated of the books of the
Lemegeto. Un nlike the other books, eff ective practice of its methods required a
detailed knowledge of both mathematics and astronomy, possessed in those days
only by those who could afford the full course of the traditional Liberal Arts educa-
tion. As well, a tremendous amount of effort went into the preparations for any sin-
gle operation of the Art. Calc ulating a single astrological chart by hand, without
even the aid of a pre-calculated ephemeris, could consume many hours. 
 There is one flaw in this sophistication, and it appears in the first paragraph of
the book. There the author describes how the pow er governed by the angels ruling
the dawn hour varies according to the day; Lunar on Monday, Martial on Tuesday,
etc. Presumably the angels of the remaining hours either govern the same power, or
follow something akin to the traditional cabalistic system of planetary hours,
described in the Greater Key o f Solom anond many other places. The problem with
this is that the procedures described in the remainder of the book suggest that an
entirely different system is being used to determine the invoked powers. 
 To create the seal for the angels of a particular hour, the magician first casts the
astrological chart for that hour in the day the work is to be done. The planetary
glyph to be drawn in the center of the seal is the planet ruling the sign on the Ascen-
dant of the chart. The glyphs of the remaining planets are drawn counterclock wise
around the rim of the seal, starting with the fastest planet and ending with the slow-
est. Fina lly, for reasons not explained, the sign that is on the cusp oftwe thelfth 
astrological house is drawn in the center next to the ruler of the Ascendant.
 Therefore the planet emphasized in the seal may be different from the planet
ruling the day of the week. For example, the date of the a’us ethorxamples fell on a
Wednesday, but since Aries was rising at dawn, the central planet in the seal for that
hour is Mars. The planet ruling the day only shows up in the seals when a sign it
rules is rising at the beginning of an hour. 
 To invoke the angel of the hour, the magician is instructed to lay the Seal upon
the Table of Practice. But he lays it upon the sigil of the planet ruling the rising sign,
not upon the sigil of the Planet ruling the day and hour according to the cabalistic
system of hours. 
22 



--------------------------------------- 23

 Ars Paulina 
 Further, the invocation used makes no mention of the cabalistic ruler of the 
Day and Hour. It does mention elements of the Seals, and also refers to the ’angels 
“rays”; this term is frequently used in medieval documents when discussing the 
action of the planets on the world, but I have never seen it used in relation to the 
cabalistic system of attributes. 
 S o every symbolic and operational element of this magick seems geared towards 
using the Lord of the Ascendant as the power ruling the hour. The preliminary 
mention of the Ruler of the Day, with its implied reference to the cabalistic method 
of rulership, is not supported by anything that comes afterwards. 
 For the Seals shown in Part 1 of the book, the author chose the date of his 
example carefully. March 10, 1641 in the Old Style calend“aarc (cording to the old 
account”) is March 21 in the New S tyle, the first full day a fter the Spring Equinox. 
This was no doubt done to ease the process of calculations, since this is one of only 
two days during the year when the magickal "hours" of the day and night are of 
equal length, and are almost exactly one clock hour in length. At any other time of 
the yea r the day and night hours are longer or shorter, and this would have made the 
process of calculating the astrological charts for each hour rather more tedious and 
error-prone. Even so, it seems that he made a few small errors in his calcula tions, 
which show up in the example seals. A modern magician, with the assistance of a 
good computer and astrology software, can easily avoid this. 
 The author calculated his charts for the date specified, and for a place at 
approximately the latitude of London, England. Comparing his seals with calculated 
charts for that date, it appears that he used a system of house calculations resembling 
the old Meridian or Porphyry systems. The Placidus house system more commonly 
used today produces results substantially different from those shown in the seals. 
 It should also be noted that, despite the assertions of one commentator on this 
book, the author used the Tropical, precession-adjusted z odiac for his calculations, 
not any version of a sidereal or constellation-oriented zodiac. The example seals can 
only be produced if the Tropical zodia c is used.
