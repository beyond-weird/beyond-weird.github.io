HOW TO BE BORN AGAIN
**********************

Some people say: "Why all this fuss  about being born again? Why
are so many talking about it?"

Nicodemus,  who was a 'ruler of the  Jews'  during  Christ's
day,  came to  Jesus asking for an advice. Jesus' simple  answer:

"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God."
(John  3:3)

Some   today,  like Nicodemus, will  ask, "How can a man be born
again when  he is old? Can he enter the second time into  his
mother's womb and be born?"  (John 3:4)

But  Jesus  answers, "That  which  is born of  flesh is flesh,
and that  which  is born  of the Spirit is  spirit,"  stating
again that one must experience a spiritual rebirth in order to 
enter heaven   -   "YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN."

-A VERY PERSONAL QUESTION-
Have  you been born again? have you  experienced  this  spiritual  
rebirth?  This is the one thing, according to the Word of God,  
that will determine your eternal destiny.

For  those  who really want to know  how  to  be  born  again,  
here is the  answer from God's inerrant Word: THE BIBLE. 
We must RECOGNIZE that FACT that we  are  sinners,  that  we
have violated  God's laws (and we ALL have). 

God says, "ALL HAVE SINNED AND COME SHORT OF THE GLORY OF GOD    
........ THERE IS NONE  RIGHTEOUS, NO NOT ONE ... THERE IS NOT 
A JUST MAN UPON EARTH  THAT DOETH GOOD  AND SINNETH NOT ...  IF 
WE SAY THAT WE HAVE NOT SINNED,   WE MAKE HIM A LIAR,  AND  HIS 
WORD  IS NOT IN US."  (Romans 3:23,10)

We  must  REPENT  of  our sins. The  Bible says:   God   
sommandeth all men  everywhere to repent."    (Acts 17:30)  

Jesus said, "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." 
(Luke 13:30)

It is not so difficult to repent  when we pause to THINK of what 
our sins have cost us,   cost our friends,  and  cost our loved 
ones - but, most of all, of what that have cost GOD.
It was for our sins, yours and mine, that God, the CREATOR and 
KING of this  universe, left heaven and came to earth in the 
person of the Lord, Jesus  Christ, to suffer and bleed and die -
that WE might be free.

"Hereby PERCEIVE we the love of God,  because HE laid down HIS 
life of us."  (1 John 3:16)

We must RECEIVE Christ INTO our  hearts and lives as our PERSONAL 
Savior and Lord. We can read John's words  about Jesus in the 
first chapter:

"He was in the world, and the world  was made by Him, and the 
world knew Him not. He came unto His own, and His own  received 
Him not. But as many as  RECEIVED Him, to THEM gave He power to  
become the sons of God, even to them  that believe on His name."  
(John  1:1-13)

--THE PROMISE OF GOD-
The moment we open our hearts to the Lord Jesus, and place our 
complete  trust in Him, and Him alone, as our  Savior, God 
promises to forgive our  sins, save our soul, and reserve for us 
a home in heaven so that, on the  authority of the Word of God,
we can  KNOW where we will spend eternity. God  tells us:

"These things have I written unto  you that believe on the name 
of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have  eternal life." 
(I John 5:13) 

Jesus  promises:
"He that heareth my word, and  believeth on Him that sent me, 
hath  everlasting life, and shall not come  into condemnation; 
but is passed from  death unto life." (John 5:24)

You can be born again SIMPLY by  praying and asking Jesus Christ 
to work this miracle in your life. You can do  it AT THIS VERY MOMENT. 
Although it is  your HEART'S attitude that counts, we  suggest 
the following prayer that may  guide you.

"JESUS, I AM WILLING TO REPENT OF MY SINS AND RECEIVE YOU AS MY
PERSONAL SAVIOR AND LORD. I WANT TO PUT YOU IN COMPLETE CHARGE
OF MY LIFE. I TURN FROM MY OWN PATH AND REPENT OF MY DIRECTION
AND ASK FOR YOU TO FORGIVE ME. I THANK YOU FOR PAYING THE PENALTY
FOR MY SINS BY DYING FOR ME AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE. THANK
YOU, GOD, FOR MAKING ME A NEW  CREATURE."

------JUST IN CASE-----
In many mailings you receive, you  come across a folded paper
that is  labeled "DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE  DECIDED NOT TO
BUY, ETC..." This is our communication. If you are thinking about
NOT making this decision, we want to make one  final comment.
God is not someone or something you  should try to explain away
... or even  pretend He isn't there, that is not  important!
Instead, why not reach out  and commit yourself to HIM
completely?  Pray the above prayer or words that  come from your
heart and MEAN it!

Just like that - you will be BORN  AGAIN, and you will find you
have taken the first step on an exciting,  mind-boggling eternal
adventure of  fellowship with the God of this  universe. An
adventure that can take  you through the pressures of this life
like NOTHING you have EVER tried  before. God promises that He
will not  send us ANYWHERE that He has not  already prepared the
way. Rest in HIM.  Come to HIM.

---We pray for each caller - If you  have prayed this prayer
today, please  leave a message for SYSOP and we will  see to it
that you get information on  this life you have stepped out to be
part of, and we will endevor to direct  you to a body of Bible
believers. God  Bless    -SYSOP

If you have met Christ today through this bulletin, I urge to take
some time to read the Bible every day.  A good place to start would
be the Gospel of John, the book of Romans, or anywhere in the New
Testament.  I also recommend that you seek out a good Bible-beliveing,
Bible-teaching church in which to fellowship and grow in your walk
with Jesus Christ.  There are many and you will know you are in the
right one by their love and worship of Jesus!  God Bless You!!
