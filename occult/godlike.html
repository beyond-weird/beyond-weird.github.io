			 What God is Like

  God is like Ford, "He has a better idea".
  He is like Coke for "He is the real thing".
  He is like Pan-Am because "He makes the going great"
  and like Bayer Aspirin "He works wonders".
  He is like General Electric, "He lights the way"
  And like a Slow Poke Sucker, "He lasts a long time".
  Like Pepsi, "He has a lot to give",
  And like Tide because "He gets out the stains that others leave behind".
  He is like Mattel, "He is swell"
  And like VO5 Hair Spray "He holds in all kinds of weather".
  He is like Standard Oil, "You can expect more from Him"
  And like Dial, "Aren't you glad you know him".
  He is like Frosted Flakes, "He makes you feel Grrrrrrreat"
  And like Sears "He has anything".
  He is like Alka Seltzer "try it - you'll like it".
  He is like Whirlpool because "He makes your world easier".
  But most of all He is like Hallmark because "He cared enough to send His very
  best"
