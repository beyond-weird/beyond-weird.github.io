 THE THIRD BOOK OF THE sACRED MAGIC.
 (The Prologue.)
 E who shall have fait hfully observed that which hath been taught unto
 him, and shall have with a good will obeyed the Commandments of
 God, let him, I say, be ce rtain that this Veritable and Loyal Wisdom
shall be accorded unto him; and also that the Perfidious BELIAL can do no
otherwise than become his slave, together with all his Pestiferous Generation.
 However I pray the True God who governeth, ruleth over, and main-
taineth all that He hath created; that thou, O Lamech, my son, or whomsoever
he may be unto whom thou shalt have granted this Sacred Operation, mayest
work it out, having always before thee the Fear of God, and in no way use it for
Evil, because God the Eternal hath wished herein to leave us our f ree will, but
woe unto him who shall abuse His Divine Grace. Yet I say not but that if an
enemy should attempt thy life, that it is permissible unto thee if necessary to
destroy him; but in any other case lay not thine hand unto the sword, but use
gentler methods. Be kind and affable unto every one. One may also serve a
friend without harm unto oneself. 
 David and King Solomon could have destroyed their enemies in an
instant, but they did not so; in imitation of God Himself who chastiseth not
unless He is outraged. 
 If thou shalt perfectly observe these rules, all the following Symbols and an
infinitude of o thers w ill b e g ranted unto t hee b y t hy Holy G uardian A ngel;
thou thus living for the Honour and Glory of the True and only God, for thine
own good, and that of thy neighbour. 
 Let the Fear of God be ever before the eyes and the heart of him who shall
possess this Divine Wisdom and Sacred Magic.

 Of Abramelin The Mage 
 Notes To The Chapters Of Magical Symbols, 
 By 
 S. L. Macgregor-mathers. 
The following Notes to these Chapters I have classed under various heads for 
greater convenience of reference, thinking that besides th e explanations of most 
of the Magical Names employed in the Sy mbols, it would also be of assistance 
to the Occult student to be able to see at a glance briefly stated at the end of 
each Chapter, the substance of the information especially referring thereto, 
given by Abraham the Je w in other parts of the work, notably towards the end 
of the Second Book: 
 Under (a) therefore I have stated by what Powers the Symbols of each par- 
ticular Chapter are manifested. 
 Under (b )the Names of the Sub- Princes of the Evil Spirits who are the 
especial ove rseers of the execution of the effect desire d. 
 Under (c) whether the Operations of the Chapter in question can be to an 
exte nt performed by the “Familiar Spirits,” or not. 
 Under (d) an abridgment of any especial instructions given by Abraham in 
other parts of the work. 
 Under (e )I have given the meanings of most of the Names employed in 
the Squares, as far as possible, and also any additional remarks which seemed 
necessary. 
 These Magical Symbols of this Third Book consist solely of Squares of Let- 
ters, which may be roughly divided into four distinct classes. 
 (?) Those in which the whole of the Square is occupied by Letters. In this 
form the double Acrostic arrangement is especially marked; though in some few 
cases it is slightly varied by the introduction of a different name. 
 (? ) Those in which part of the Square is left vacant, the Letters being 
arranged in the form of what is called in Geometry, a Gnomon. 
 (? ) Those in which the central part of the Square is left vacant, the Le tters 
forming a border round the void part. 
 (? ) Those of more irregular disposition, and in which in some instances 
single Letters are placed separately in the vacant part of the Square . 
 It will be remarked that in nearly all cases these Names arranged in the 
Squares represent generally the effect to be produced, or in other words are sim- 
ply the Hebrew o r other appellations of the result t o which t he Square is to be 
applied. At the beginning of each Chapter is placed a numbered list of the 
effects to be obtained by the use of each Symbol there given. Then follow the 
Squares themselves. 
 124



--------------------------------------- 8

 The Sacred Magick 
 In the Original MS. these Squares have been also numbered to correspond 
with the list at the beginning of each Chapter, but from the evident difference 
in the ink this has been done later, though the handwriting is the same. I think
also that in several cases the numbers to the Squares have been misplaced; and 
though usually the natural Sequence?, o?, f ?, ?, ?, ? is adhered to, yet occa-
sionally they are in a more irregular order, as in?th the Chap ter, for example,
where they run thu?,s ?: , ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ??, ??, ??. 
 The Squares in the Original MS. are all of the same size, subdivided 
according to the exigences of the case, though convenience of printing has pre- 
vented this equality o f size being adhered to in the present work. In most 
instances the Gnomons and Borders are ruled off from the vacant part, but this 
rule is not adhered to in all cases in the Original MS. The Letters in the Squares
are Roman Capitals. In some few instances two letters are placed in the same 
small Square, or subdivision, of the larger Square. 
 Notes To Chapter I. 
 (a) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Angels or by 
the Guardian Angel. 
 (b) ORIENS, PAYMON, ARITON, and AMAYMON execute the Opera- 
tions hereof by means of their Common Ministers. 
 (c) The Familiar Spirits cannot well execute the Operations of this Chap- 
ter. 
 (d) Take the Symbol in your hand, place it under your hat or cap, upon the
top of y our head, and you w ill be s ecretly answered by the Spirit who will exe-
cute th at which you wi sh. (This mode of operation will evidently be applicable
to many of the Chapters.) 
 (e) No. ? is a Square o??f Squares, and is a complete specimen of double 
Acrostic arrangeme nt. MILON, though Greek-sounding, has here hardly a 
meaning if derived from either MILOS, a fruit or other tree; or from 
MEILON, a precious thing, or article of value. It seems rather derived from the 
Hebrew MLVN = a diversity of things, or matters. IRAGO is perhaps from 
Greek EIRA a question, or inquiry, and AGO to conduct or decide. Hebrew 
RGO = to disrupt or analyse. LAMAL, probably from Chaldaic MLA = full- 
ness, entirety. OGARI from Hebrew OGR = a swallow or swiftly-flying thing. 
NOLIM from Hebrew, NOLIM = hidden or covered things. Whence we may 
extract the following as the formula of this Squ“Vaarer:i ous questions fully 
examined and analysed, and that quickly, and even things carefully hidden and 
conceale”d. This rule we can apply to discover the formulas of other Square s. 
125 



--------------------------------------- 9

 Of Abramelin The Mage 
 No. ? is a Square o??f Squares, and is also a complete Specimen of double 
Acrostic. THIRAMA from Chaldee TIRM = strongly defended places, or Cita- 
dels. HIGANAM from Hebrew or Chaldee GNN or GNM = to defend. 
IGOGANA, perhaps from Hebrew GG = a roof or covering or protection from 
above. RAGIGAR, perhaps from Ch aldaic ROO (it must be remembered that, 
though I here transliterate the letter Ayin by O, it has really the power of a GH 
as well; it is a sound difficult of comprehension by a non-Orientalist) = to bre ak 
up, or breach. ANAGOGI probably from Greek ANAGOGE the act of raising 
or elevating. MANAGIH from Hebrew MNO to restrain; stop, put a barrier 
to, or contain by a barrier. AMARIHT from Hebrew AMRTH = Word or 
Speech. The whole idea of this Formula seems to be the making forcible way 
into a defended place or matter. 
 No. ? is a Square o??f Squares, and again a perfect form of double Acros- 
tic. DORE H, from DVR Hebrew = a habitation. ORIRE perhaps from Latin 
ORIOR = to rise r or be born. RINIR perhaps from Hebre w NIR = to renew. 
ERIRO perhaps from ARR to curse. HEROD from Hebrew ChRD = shaking, 
trembling. 
 No. ? is a Square o??f Squares, and again a perfect double Acrostic. 
NABHI from Hebrew NBA = to prophesy. ADAIH perhaps from Heb. DIH = 
a bird of omen. BAKAB from Heb. KAB = in trouble. HIADA from Hebrew 
IDH = sent forward, or thrown. IHBAN from IHB Hebrew = to give or bring. 
Hence the formula would be somewh“Toat prophesy by omens the troubles to 
come”; t he w hich i s m uch m ore a pplicable t o N? , o“.Th e Tribulations to 
come”; than to No. ? , which is fo“rT he Things to happen in W”a. r 
 No. ? is a double Acrostic of?? S quares. NVDETON from Hebrew ND = 
to remove, and ATHN = strongly. VSILARO from Hebrew BSHL = to ripen, 
and Chaldaic ARO = the Earth. DIREMAT from Hebre w DR = to encompass 
or include, and MT = things forgotten or slipped aside. ELEMELE from 
Hebrew ALIM and ALH = God of the Mighty One s. TAMERID from Hebrew 
THMR = straight like a palm-tree, and ID = put forward. ORALISV = from 
Hebrew = ORL = superfluous, and ISh = the substance. NOTEDVN, from 
NTH = to stretch out and DN = to contend or rule. 
 No. ? is a double Acrostic ??of Sq uares. SARAPI from Hebrew ShRP = to 
burn. ARAIRP from Hebrew AR = a river, and RPH = to abate or slacken. 
RAKKIA from Hebrew RKK = to become faint, to become softened. AIKKAR 
from Hebrew OKR = to trouble or disturb. PRIARA from PRR = to shatter or 
break up. IPARAS from Hebrew PRS = to break in pieces, to divide, or part in 
sunder. This will g ive a formula of trouble. 
 126



--------------------------------------- 10

 The Sacred Magick 
 No. ? is a double Acrostic o??f S quares. MALACH from Hebrew MLCh
= Salt; also that which is easily dissolved; to dissolve. AMANEC from MNK = a
chain, or from AMN - stability. LANANA from LNN = to lodge, or take up
one’s a bode. A NANAL f rom A N = l abour, and N LH, t o complete o r f inish.
CENAMA perhaps from QNM = odoriferous. HCALAMpe rhapfrs om HCL =
spacious (as a palace). 
 No. ? is a d ouble Acrostic ??of Squares. KOSEM, f rom Hebrew Q SM =
to divine or prognosticate. OBODE, from Hebrew OBD = a servant. SOFOS
from Greek SOPHOS = wise, learned, skilful. EDOBO, perhaps from DB = to
murmur. MESOK from Hebrew MSK = to mingle or intermix. 
 No. ? is a double Acrostic o?? f S quares. ROTHER is perhaps from RTT,
Trembling, Dread; and HRR to conceive or bring forth. ORORIE from
Hebrew OROR = laying bare, disclosing. TOARAH from Hebrew THVRH =
Law, Reason, o r O rder. HARAOTfrom Hebrew HRH to b ring forth, o r from
CHRTH = To inscribe or mark down. REHTOR from RTT and ThVR = rea-
son f or dread.The wh ole formula will represent the disclosing of the reasons for
dreading any terrible effect. 
 No. ?? is another double Acrostic ??of Sq uares, and No??. one of?? 
Squares. I have here given a sufficiently careful analysis of the meanings of the
combinations formed by the letters in the preceding Squares to give the Reader
a general idea of the formulas involved. To avoid an undue extension of these
notes, I shall not usually analyse every name contained in each Square, but shall
confine myself in most cases to giving sufficient indications of the meanings of
the principal words or words only, which are therein employed. Th e Reader
must remember also that in such an Acrostic arrangement of the letters of
words, half of those therein contained will simply be inversions of the principal
word or words therein contained. For example, in?? , NRo.E AHBEM is of
course MEBHAER written backwards. ELIAILE reads the same way backwards
or forwards, and so does HAOROAH; and BIKOSIA written backwards gives
AISOKIB. Yet undoubtedly some of these words are to an extent translatable
also, and in this case will be found to have a bearing on the subject-matter of
the Square. Hebrew especially is a language in which this method will be found
to work with a readiness unattainable in ordinary European languages, from the
fact that its Alphabet may be said to be entirely Consonantal in character, even
such letters as Aleph, Vau, and Yod, being rather respectively, a drawing in of
the breath than the letter A; V rather than U. and Y rather than I. Also in com-
mon with all really ancient languages the system of Verbal Roots from which all
the words of the language are derived, has this effect, viz., that the majority of
combinations of two or three letters will be found to be a Verbal Root, bearing
127 



--------------------------------------- 11

 Of Abramelin The Mage 
a definite meaning. Besides all this, in the Qabalah each letter of the Hebrew 
Alphabet is treated as having a complete sphere of hieroglyphic meanings of its 
own; whence the most important ancient Hebrew Names and Words can be 
treated by the Qabalistic Initiate as in fact so many formulas of Spiritua?l force. 
have been thus lengthy in explanation in order that the Reader may have some 
idea of the reason of the construction and use of these Magic Squares.

 (a) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested partly by the Angels, and 
partly by the Evil Spirits. 
 (b) ORIENS, PAYMON, ARITON, and AMAYMON execute the Opera-

 (c) The Familiar Spirits can to an extent execute the Operations of this 
Chapter. 
 (d) T ake t he S ymbol i n y our h and, a nd n ame w hat i nformation you 
require. (In the Second Book, the remarks given concerning this Chapter are 
evidently far more applicable to the Third Chapter, and I have therefore given 
them there instead of he re.) 
 (e) No. ? is an Acrostic o??f Square s. ALLUP from He bre w ALUP = a 
Doctor, Teacher, Leader, ie., a person who at the same time leads and instructs 
his following. Hence also this word means a Bull as the Leader of the herd. 
URIEL, Hebrew AURIEL = Light of God, is the well-known name of one of 
the ArchangelsP. ulla in Latin means both a fowl, and also light friable e arth; 
but is probably here derivable rather from the Hebrew PLH, meaning to clas- 
sify or arrange. 
 No. ? is an Acrostic o??f Squares. MELAMMED is evidently from 
Hebrew MLMD = a stimulus or spur to exertion. 
 No. ? is an Acrostic o??f Squares. EKDILUN may be from the Greek 
Ekdeilon, which means,“no t afraid o”f; from ek- in composition, anded ilon, 
frightened, cowardly.

AMR or IMR = To speak. LEIRU is the reverse of URIEL, ie., Uriel written 
backwards. This formula seems to show that the Symbol should be nu?mbered 
instead of? .

 Of Abramelin The Mage 
 Notes To Chapter V. 
 (a) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested only by the Angels or by 
the Guardian Angel. 
 (b) ORIENS, PAIMON, ARITON, and AMAYMON execute the Opera- 
tions hereof by means of their Common Ministers. 
 (c) The Familiar Spirits can hardly be said so much of themselves to be 
able to execute the Operations of this Chapter, as under the rule of the afore- 
mentioned Spirits. 
 (d) Each person can have four Familiar Spirits and no more: the first work- 
ing from Sunrise to Midday; the second from Midday till Sunset; the third 
from Sunset to Midnight; and the fourth from Midnight till Sunrise. Such Spir- 
its may also be loane d to friends, in which case you can avail yourself of an other 
ordinary Spirit in place. 
 (e) The Square numbered? is not howe ver placed first in Order in the 
MS., but fifth. It is a Gnomon of?? Squares taken from a Square?? of Sq uares. 
ANAKIM = Hebrew ONQIM = Giants; the root ONQ also = a necklace or 
torque. This word“An akim” hardly appears to have any reference to the form 
of a lion. 
 No. ? is a Gnomon of?? Squares again, taken from a Square?? o Sqf uares, 
and is in the MS. placed sixth in order. CEPHIR in Hebrew means KPIR a 
young Lion; and this Square should probably therefore be numb?. ered 
 No. ? is a Gnomon of?? Squares taken from a Square?? o fSq uares; and in
the MS. occupies the first place in ordeOirk. eti,s Greek, means a maid-servant 
or feminine page. This Square therefore should probably be num? . bered 
 No. ? is a Gnomon o?f Squares taken from a Square of?? Sq uares.
PARAS = Hebrew PRSh, a horse, or horseman, while PRS = an ossifrage, a bird 
of the hawk or eagle kind. This Square is apparently correctly numbered, 
though in the MS. it is in the second place. ?N ios. a Gnomon of? Sq uares
taken from a Square of?? Squares. RACAH is apparently from the Hebrew 
RQH meaning vain, empty; and does not seem to have any p articular reference 
to any of the forms mentioned for the Symbols. 
 No. ? is again a Gnomon o? Sqf uares, taken from a Square?? of Sq uares. 
It is placed fourth in order in the MS. CUSIS may be from the dative plural of 
the Gree k word KUON = a dog, but in Hebrew it would mean numbering, 
computing. 
 No. ? is a border of?? Squares taken from a Square?? o Sqf uares. PERA- 
CHI, perhaps from PRK, Savagery. DB is a Bear in Hebrew. 
 138

 The Sacred Magick 
 No. ? is a Square o??f Squares. RISIR, perhaps from Lati“n RISOR, ” a 
mocker or jester. ISERI, perhaps from Hebrew or Ch aldaic Root, ISR, to pun- 
ish or whip. SEKES, perhaps from SCHSH = reborn by hope . 
 No. ? is again a Square ??of S quares. NESER = Hebrew, NShR, an Eagle; 
which seems to shew that this Square should be numb? . ELeredEH E is proba- 
bly ALHI, Hebrew = My God. SEPES ? ShPS = t he hair on the lip, t he mous- 
tache. RESEN = RSN Heb., = a bridle or bit. 
 No. ?? is a Gnomon o??f Squares taken from a Square o?? Sqf uares.
PETHEN = Hebrew, PThN, an Asp or venomous Serpent, whence this Square 
should probably be number??ed. 
 No. ?? i s a S quare o ??f Squares. KALEF = KLP, Hebrew, a hammer. 
ARARE from He brew ARR t o curse , cursed. LAMAL p erhaps me“anins 
speaking” from MLL, Hebrew, to speak. 
 No. ?? is a Gnomon of? Squares taken from a Square of?? Sq uares.
KOBHA = perhaps Hebrew KBH = to extinguish.

 Notes To Chapter XV. 
 (a) The Symbols of this Chapter are manifested in Part by the Angels, and 
in part also by the Evil Spirits. 
 (b) ASMODEE and MAGOT together execute the Operations of this 
Chapter. 
 (C) The Familiar Spirits cannot well execute the Operations of this Chap- 
ter. 
 (d) As for these Symbols and all like ones appertaining unto this Chapter, 
when you shall wish to make use of them, you shall put them between two 
plates, dishes, or jugs, closed together on the outside of a window; and before a 
quarter of an hour shall have passed you will find and will have that which you 
have demanded; but you must clearly understand that with such kinds of 
viands you cannot nourish men for more than two days. For this food although 
it be appreciable by the eyes, and by the mouth, doth not long nourish the 
body, w hich hath s oon hunger again, seeing t hat this food gives n o strength t o 
the stomach. Know also that none of these viands can remain visible for more 
than ?? hours, the which period being passed, fresh ones will be requisite.

Magic fe asts in the“Ar abian Nights” and elsewhere.

endeavour to use these Signs, that unless animated by the purest and best 
motives they will find them react terribly against them; and that, if the prelimi- 
nary period of Six Mont’h ps reparation advocated by Abra-Melin be not

observed, the Names in the Squares for the most part are simply the state ment

 “ACCURSED BE H E W HO T AKETH T HE N AME O F G OD I N

 Of Abramelin The Mage 
 ESSENTIAL REMARKS UP ON THE FOREGOING SYMBOLS. 
It is certain that among all the Symbols which I have hereinbefore written 
down there be many which one can employ for evil (purposes); and I avow that 
(at first) I intended not to give them here at all; but thereafter I did make reflec- 
tion in myself that I was working no evil; for often the secret judgments of God 
pe rmit disgrace, hindrances, infirmities, and other vexing accidents to happen 
unto Mortals, either to awake them from the lethargy wherein they be sunk so 
that the y recognise not their Creator, or else to give them an opportunity by 
their afflictions of increasi ng their me rit. And although God can in no way do 
evil, but always good, nevertheless we cannot deny that occasionally He permit- 
teth the Secondary Causes to act. Now the Executioners and Executors of the 
Divine justice be the Evil Spirits. Whence I conclude that although it may be in 
no sense advisable to work Operations for Evil, yet that there may arise, how- 
ever, certain cases which do admit of and permit the same; as (for example) 
when i t i s n ecessary t o save a nd defen’ds o o nwen life, or to avert some great 
scandal or evil, or to prevent offensive acts which might be done against one- 
self, or to displease God and hurt’ ons neeighbour, as well as in just Wars, and 
other like cases. Yet it is always best in such instances to govern yourself accord- 
ing to the counsel of your Holy Guardian Angel. I have also written these for 
the reason that God hath given unto Man free Will both in merit and demerit; 
for, further, having finished the Operation, if thou shouldest wish (which I pray 
 1 
God not to permit) to operate for Evil and to abuse the Grace which God hath 
granted thee, the Spirits would be only too ready to give and manifest unto thee 
the Symbols, and will grant willingly unto thee all that thou shalt demand of 
them. Concerning this matter I repeat unto thee, Fear the Lord, love Him, and 
respect His Commandments with a good heart, and thou shalt live happy and 
contented upon Earth. 
 If thou considerest maturely what be the essential points of this Operation, 
thou shalt find that the first point is to make a firm, veritable, and real resolu- 
tion to live in a truly edifying condition of modesty, and in retirement, as far as 
it s hall be possible for thee so to d o. For Solitude is t he s ource o f m any b less- 
ings, such as, to give oneself up to prayer, and unto the contemplation of things 
Divine; to flee evil conversations and occasions of sin; to live in oneself; and to 
accustom oneself to continuing a life of such regularity. For if one were to go to 
present oneself before a King, what would one not do to appear before him 
with splendour and magnificence; and what diligence and care would not one

put in practice to prepare oneself hereunto. Now we must understand that the
enjoyment and vision of the Angels of the Lord be infinitely above the Princes
of Earth, who in fact are but a vanity, a shadow, and v ile dust of Earth. Now if
to please these Mortal Princes one would almost commit id olatries; what ought
one not to do to appear before the Holy Angels of God who represent the
Grandeur of the Majesty of God. Let each one hold for a thing, sure and certain
that the 
 Grace which th e Lord grante th unto us in giving us this Sacred Scie nce by
the means and intermediation of His Holy Angels is so great that none can fitly
express it. 
 It is certain that having obtained this Sacred Wisdom thou mayest dispose
of it and communicate it unto three friends; b ut thou must not exceed this
Sacred N umber o f t he Ternary, f or i n s uch c ase t hou w ouldest b e a ltogether
deprived of it. One of the most meritorious deeds in the sight of the Lord, is to
share with on’s e neighbour the goods whi ch God hath given unto us; yet must
we t ake n ote o f t hat w hich God c ommanded uMontseo s, when He ordered
him to give the Operation unAarto on his brother, namely that he should
receive as the Symbol of an Offering Ten Golden Florins, t he which h e should
distribute unto Seventy-Two poor persons with his own hands, obliging them
to repeat the Psalms which I have already mentioned in the Second Book, and
which should be of the number of SeventyTwo. For if he who rece iveth this
Operation should not perform this Alms, the Operation would be void of value
for him. Thou, not yet having the Authority to give it, without having received
the Ten Golden Florins, thou must act liMkeo ses, unto whom the Lord
granted it on this condition, for him to give it unto his broAatheronr .
 I have also described the precautions which we must take before granting
this Sacred Science unto an y; and I repeat here that at least Six Months should
transpire during which we should frequently test, and seek by conversations to
sound, the inclinations of him unto whom we may be willing to give it; so as to
know whether he be a reliable person, and also the object for wh ich he deman-
deth and is anxious to obtain this Science. Now shouldest thou perceive that
such an one is light and inconstant, and that he hath only vague ideas, and hab-
its and manners which be not good, then shalt thou temporise with him for a
time, s o as t o b ring u p causes, o ccasions, or pretexts, s o a s n ot t o g ive i t u nto
him, even shouldest thou already have promised it to him. For it is better to
undergo the displeas ure of a Mortal Man than that of an Eternal God, from
Whom t hou hast r eceived so g reat a Grace. I h ave, h owever, m yself made t rial
hereof, for to my great wonderment (once upon a time) when I was thinking
that I was putting it to good use in giving it unto a certain person for whom I

 Of Abramelin The Mage 
had great respect; God Himself intervened and did not permit my intention to 
be carried out, for that person began of his own accord to wonder whether the 
matter were true or no, and he doubted it much, believing that it was a fable, 
and did not have an en tire faith therein; and he made me comprehend by his 
discourse that he was not such an one as I had thought. Furtherm ore it hap- 
pened th at he fell dangerously ill, and I in my tu rn was reprimanded by my 
Angel who blamed me for the choice I had made. The whole machinery of the 
Universe is maintained by Faith; and he who believeth not, suffereth the chas- 
tisement of his perfidy both in this World and in the next. I could here say 
much more relating to our own selves, but as thou wilt have to pass under the 
 2 
influence of thy Holy Guardian Angel, thou wilt be sufficiently instructed in 
his own good time, and by himself, concerning these matters which be both 
 3 
delicate and to be jealously guarded. 
 The Evil Spirit is so subtle, so keen, and so cunning, that that which he 
cannot o btain a t t he t ime o f t he C onjuration, h e w ill s eek t o h ave o n o ther 
occasions in offering thee his services. This is why the very first action to take 
especially with thy Familiar Spirits, should be to command them, never to say 
anything unto thee of themselves, but only to speak when thou shalt interro- 
gate them, unless it were to warn thee of matters which concern either thine 
advantag e or thine hurt. For if thou dost not limit their liberty of speech they 
will tell thee so many and so important things, that they will completely over- 
 4 
cloud thine understanding, and thou wilt not know what to believe, so that in 
the confusion of ideas they could make thee prevaricate, and perhaps fall into 
irretrievable error. Never make thyself to be greatly entreated in any matter 
wherein thou canst aid and succour thy neighbour, and do not wait until he 
demandeth assistance from thee, but seek to know to the full his need even 
though it be concealed, and give him prompt aid. Also trouble not thyself as to 
whether he be Turk, Pagan, or Idolater, but do good unto all those who believe 
in a God. Be especially charitable towards those who are in extreme want, pris- 
oners, or sick, and let thine heart be touched, and succour them generously; for 
God tak eth pleasure in beholding the poor succoured. 
 In the Twenty-Eighth Chapter where it is treated of the way to have Silver 
and Gold sufficient to supply on’s nee eds on occasion; thou must know that

the quantity of Gold or of Silver of which thou hast then actually need, will be 
at once brought unto thee, and thou canst use it for this occasion only. And if 
thou usest it not within the twenty-four hours, this sum will disappear and 
thou wilt no longer be able to avail thyself of it, Think not, however, that this 
Gold is but a phantasy, for if thou effectually expendest it, and dost not endeav- 
our to hoard the same, he who shall receive it from thine hands can enjoy the 
same and expend it according unto his d esire, and t he money will b e real both 
for him and for others. 
 For once only mayest thou demand of thine Holy Angel the amount of 
Gold and of Silver which thou shalt judge suitable unto thine estate and condi- 
tions. My possessions were few, and I demanded of mine Angel Three Thou- 
 5 
sand Thousand Golden Florin s, and they were granted unto me. Later I made 
such good use of the Sacred Science, and I understood so well how to augment 
my goods, that at the present time, after hav ing married three Daughters unto 
each of whom I gave a hundred thousand (golden florins), as thou wilt see by 
the testament which I have made, I am leaving in current money more than a 
Million Golden Florins, besides a large quantity of very valuable furniture. Had 
I be en of noble birth I might have demanded much more and have profited 
less. When any one demanded of me“Eh : ! How have you managed to gain so 
much?” I would re ply thereto that it is a fine thing to know by certain Knowl- 
edge how much such or such a thing is worth here, and how much it is worth 
elsewhere, that this year, wheat, barley, and other crops, will be cheap in Italy, 
and dear in France, etc., etc.; and that commerce well managed, enricheth any 
one. 
 As for wh at concerneth the manner of treating and commanding the Spir- 
its, it is an easy thing unto whomsoever walketh by the proper paths; and it is a 
very difficult thing for whomsoever through ignorance submitteth himself unto 
them. I have heard say that there be some men who pass for being famous 
herein, such as a certain blind mD’an acali, a certain Bearli , a Peter 
 6 
D’Abano, and many others. Ah! how many of them do but deceive them- 
selves! I do not say th at these men did not perform extraordinary things; but it 
is necessary to note their manner of working, for their Science is impe rfect, and 
their Authority proceedeth not from God by the intermediation of His Holy 
 7
Angels, but proceedeth directly from express Pacts made with the an Dedvil, 
(acteth) by means of Consecrated Books full of thousands of Diabolical Conju-

rations and impious Exorcisms; in one word things which be contrary unto the 
Commandments of God a nd the peace of men. And wi th all this their Opera- 
tions be destined for certain times and hours, and finally the Demon carrieth 
away with him their miserable Souls, which thing arriveth only too often. And 
yet it is the Science of these persons which causeth them to pass for famous 
Wise Men. 
 In the First Book I have made mention of those whom I had encountered 
in my journeyings in Europe. The true Commandment is that which depen- 
deth f rom G od, a nd i n w hich t here i s n o d ependence p laced o n a ny S pirit 
imagin able, for in employin g them, if you make unto them the least submis - 
sion, the slightest prayer, or honour, you are rendering yo urselves their slaves, 
and they are in no way submitted unto you. The Spirits have so great knowl- 
edge th at they comprehend very well by our actions what dispositions we have, 
and understand our inclinations, so that from the very beginning they prepare 
the way to make us to fail. If they know that a man is inclined unto Vanity and 
Pride , they will humiliate themselves before him, and push that humility unto 
excess, and even unto idolatry, and this man will glory herein and become 
intoxicated with conceit, and the matter will not end without his commanding 
them some pernicious thing of such a nature that ultimately thence from will 
be derived that sin which will make the Man the Slave of the Demon. Another 
man will be easily accessible to Avarice, and then if he take not heed the Malig- 
nant Spirits will propose unto him thousands of ways of accumulating wealth, 
and of rendering himself rich by indirect and unjust ways and means, whence 
total restitution is afterwards d ifficult and eve n impossible, so that he who is in 
such case findeth himself ever the Slave of the Spirits. Another will be a man of 
Letters; the Spirits will inspire him with presumption, and he will then believe 
himself to be wiser even than the Prophets, furthe rmore they will endeavour to 
lead him astray in subtle points in matters appertaining unto God, and will 
make (that man) fall into a thousand errors, the which afterwards when he 
wisheth to support he will very frequently deny God, and His high Mysteries. 
The causes and matters whereof (the Spirits) will make use to cause a man to 
waver are infinite, especially when the man attempteth to make them submit to 
his commands, and this is why it is most necessary to b e up’son guar onde and 
to d istrust o neself, The t rue C ommandment w ill b e t hat which w ill b e g iven

 Abraham the Jew.

 The Sacred Magick 
Man not having on his side the support of the Power and Will of the Lord shall 
have sufficient force to command the Spirits and to constrain them to o bey 
him; (they, namely) who have the same virtue and power, which God hath 
granted unto the m, they having lost nothing hereof; and they also being Spirits 
from God and herein differing from thee who art drawn from the mire, as Gold 
is from Lead; and that their sin is notorious, for the which they were chased 
from Heaven; figure also u nto t hyself, that a Spirit w hich o f h is own n ature is 
all vanity, would not be likely to submit himself unto thee without a superior 
 8
force (compelling him), neither would he wish to obey thee nor to serve thee. 
He who shall reflect and reason upon these particulars will know that all things 
come unto us from God, and th at it is He Who wisheth and commande th that 
the Evil Spirits should be submitted unto us. If then all things depend from the 
Lord, upon whom wilt thou? Ma, n, base thyself so as to be capable of thyself 
(alone) to dominate the Spirits ? It is certain that such an enterprise cannot suc- 
ceed without the loss of thine own soul. Then it is by the virtue of that God 
Who hath submitted them under thy feet, that thou shalt command them, as 
will be precisely o rdained unto thee by t hy Holy A“Dngoenl.e c ponam inimi- 
cos tuos sc abellum Pedum tuorum.” “Until I shall make thy foes thy footst”ool. 
Also do not familiarise thyself with them; for they b e not little pet dogs. Adopt 
a serious tone and an air of authority, make them obey thee, and be well ware of 
accepting the least offer which they shall make unto thee of themselves; and 
treat them as their Master, also without occasion thou shalt never molest them, 
and order them to execute thy commands from point to point without adding 
or diminishing in any way imaginable. And when t hou canst employ Inferior 
Spirits (in a matter), thou shalt in no way make thy requests unto the Superiors. 
Also seeing that all have not the same powers, thou shalt take heed not to com- 
mand unto one (Spirit) a thing appertaining unto (the office of) another; and 
because it would be impossible for me to here write down in full the quality, 
virtue, and office of each Spirit, thou shouldest search this out for thyself and 
sharpen thy faculties; and in the first demand which thou shalt make unto the 
Four Spirits (who are) the Supreme Princes, and unto the Eight Sub-Princes; 
thou shalt demand the most skilful of the Spirits, of whom thou shalt make a 
register fo r convenience of the practice which I describe unto thee in this Third 
Book where also thou wilt find the Symbols of many Spirits. But seeing that the 
subjects of various erring humours (of mind) and other occasions which arise 
daily be diverse, each man will procure for himself those (Spirits) which be of

his nature and genius and fit for that wherein thou wouldest employ them. And 
when thou shalt find an extreme resistance unto operating, on the part of any 
Spirit, after that thou shalt have given him the necessary instructions, and that 
he c annot e xecute that w hich t hou h ast c ommanded h im; i n s uch c ase thou 
shalt convoke the Superio r Spirits and demand of them others which may be 
better capable of serving thee in thy need. And in all cases thou shalt avail thy- 
self of the power and command of thy Holy Angel. Keep ever continually 
before thine eyes the Fear of God; and seek to obey His Commandments, and 
those of thy Holy Angel, ever retain in thine heart his holy instructions; never 
submit thyself unto the Evil Spirits in the slightest degree even should it se em 
to be to thine own advantage and unto that of thy neighbour (so to do). For the 
rest, be certain that they will obey thee so perfectly and really, that there will be 
no operation however great or difficult it may be, that thou shalt not bring 
unto a glorious termination, the which I myself also have done. As regardeth 
the servic e which thou shouldest render unto thy neighbour in his necessities, 
thou shouldest perform it with zeal, and in no sense wait for him to ask it of 
thee, and seek also to comprehend his needs unto the uttermost, so as to be able 
to take sound action (therein). Thou shalt take heed to succour the infirm and 
the sick and to work for their healing; and see that thou dost not g ood works to 
attract praises and to make thyse lf talked of in the world. Also thou mayest 
make semblance of performing (thy cures) by prayers, or by ordinary remedies, 
or by (the recital of) some psalm, or by other like means. 
 Thou shouldest be especially circumspect not to discover the like matters 
unto re igning Princes; and in this particular thou shalt do nothing without con- 
sulting thy Good Angel; for there is a certain generation which is never con- 
tented, and besides that which ariseth from simple curiosity, these Princes 
regard such (action) as a duty and obligation. Also it is a certain fact that he 
who possesseth this Sacred Magic, hath no need whatever of them. Further they 
are naturally inclined to ask of thee always things prejudic ial, the whic h if 
granted by thee would o ffend the Lord, and if not they be come your de clared 
enemies. Now my opinion (is that it) would be always (preferable) to render 
them what services you can from a distance. 
 There is nothing which is so pleasing unto the Angels as to demand knowl- 
edge from them, and for my part I think there is no greater pleasure than that 
of becoming wise when one learneth from such masters.

 I both have exhorted, and do exhort unto a solitary wh lifeic, h is the
source o f all g ood; i t i s t rue t hat it i s d ifficult t o a ccustom o neself t hereunto;
but once thou shal t have obtained the Sacred Science and Magic the love for 
retirement will come unto thee of thine own accord, and thou wilt voluntarily 
shun the commerce with and conversation of men; for the pleasure and con- 
tentment t hou w ilt e njoy w hen t hou shalt be t he possessor of t his S cience will 
be so great that thou wilt despise all amusements, excursions, riches, and every 
other thing however attractive such may be. 
 For once only will it be permissible to obtain property and goods propor- 
tionate unto thy degree and estate; the which afterwards are to be used by 
spending them liberally for thine own needs and those of thy neighbour, shar- 
ing with him in his necessity the good things which God shall have given (unto 
thee); for he who should employ these for evil ends shall render himself incapa- 
ble of obtaining from God any other grace and benefit. 
 The Child which one should choose for greater surety and success in (the 
acquisition of) this Sacred Science should be born of a legitimate marriage, and 
its father and mother should be also legitimate. It should be from six to seven 
years of age, vivaci ous, and witty; it should have a clear speech and pronounce 
well. Thou shalt prepare it some time before commencing the Operation and 
have it ready when the time requireth. I myself am of opinion that there should 
be two (children) in case of any accident which might happen, through sick- 
ness, or death, or other like (hindrance). Thou shalt gain it over to thee by giv- 
ing it puerile things to amuse it, and have it ready when nece ssary, but in no 
way t ell i t anything o f w hat i t is t o s erve for, s o t hat i f i t b e q uestioned b y i ts
parents it can tell them nothing. An d if it be a well-behaved Child, it is all the 
better. We m ay be certain that by this m eans we can arrive at the possession of 
the Sacred Science; for where he who operateth faileth, the innocence of the 
Child supplieth (that which is wanting); and the Holy Angels are much pleased 
 10 
with its purity. We should not admit women into this Operation. 
 All the clothes and other things which have been used during the p eriod of 
the Six Moons, you should preserve, if you intend to continue in the same 
house wherein thou hast performed the Operation, because they be always 
good. But if tho u dost not intend to use them more, nor yet the Oratory, thou

 most of the leading political events of his time.

 Of Abramelin The Mage 
 It is now necessary to give unto thee a little light, and declare unto thee the 
quality and value of the Spirits, and in what thou canst exactly employ them 
with surety of success. Thou must however take note that each Spirit hath a 
great quantity of Inferior Spirits which be submitted unto him. Also I wish to 
say that as regardeth things base, vile, and of little importance the Supe rior 
Spirit will not execute them, but will cause them to be execute d by his Inferiors 
with all punctuality. And this mattereth not unto him who operateth provided 
that his commands be fulfilled, and that he be punctually obeyed. 
 THE O RDER OF THE FIRST HIERARCHY. 
 11 
 (Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones. ) 
The Spirits of the Seraphim s erve t o m ake t hee r e specte d a nd l oved f or 
works of Charity, for that which regardeth honours and other similar things. In 
matters of great importance they themselves act; but fo r matters base and car - 
nal, it is their subjects who do serve and operate. 
 THE ORDER OF THE SECOND HIERARCHY. 
 Dominions, Virtues, And Powers. 
The property of thDoe minions is to dominate; to procure liberty; to vanquish 
enemies; to give authority over Princes, and over all kinds of persons, even 
Ecclesiastics. 
 The Virtues are proper to give strength and force in all matters whether 
of War or Peace; and in all Operations concerning the health of men, and in all 
maladies for which the fatal hour hath not yet been written. 
 The Powers have the dominion over all the Inferior Spirits; and this is 
why they can serve in all things in general, good or evil, and they are devoted 
unto all things in general, good or evil; and they be straight and right in execu- 
tion, very punctual, very prompt, a nd exact in their Operations. 
 TH E ORDER OF THE THIRD HIERARCHY. 
 Princes, Archangels, And Angels . 
The Princes comprise Spirits capable of giving Treasures and Riches, and they 
or their dependants serve in all the Operations, being a mass composed of dif- 
ferent Orders, and they are sufficiently truthful. 
 11. These and the following Titles of the Hierarchi es are usually ascribed to the Good 
 Angels; but sometimes are also emp loyed to designate g rades of the Evil and Fallen 
 Angels as well. 
 216



--------------------------------------- 100

 The Sacred Magick 
 The Archangels be proper to reveal all Occult matters, and all kinds of 
secret things, such as obscure points in Theology and t he Law. They serve with 
great diligence. 
 The Angels in general do operate each one according unto his quality. 
There be an infinite number of them. They command the Four Princes and the 
 12 
Eight Sub-Princes in all kinds of Operations. These la havtter ing taken their
oath, observe that which they have promised, provided that the Operation one 
demandeth of them be in their power. 
 To cause the Spirit to re-enter a dead body is a very great and difficult 
 13
Operation, because in order to accomplish it the Four Sovereign P harincvees 
to operate. Also it is necessary to take great care, and to pay heed unto this 
warning, namely that we should not commence this Operation until the sick 
person is really at the point of death, so that his life is absolutely despaired of. It 
should be so ti med as to take place a little whi le before the sick person giveth up 
the ghost; and thou shalt carry out all that we have said hereon in the Second 
Book. But on no account should we perform this Operation to divert ourselves, 
nor for every class of person; but only on occasions of the very utmost and most 
absolute necessity. This Operation I myself have performed but twice in my 
life, namely once for the Duke of Saxonia, and o n another occa sion in the case 
of a lady whom the Emperor Sigismond loved passionately. 
 The Familiar Spirits are very prompt, and they are able to execute in 
most minute de tail all matters of a mechanical nature,, with the which therefore 
it is well to occupy them; as in historical painting; in making statues; clocks; 
weapons; and other like matters; also in chemistry; and in causing them to 
carry out commercial and business transactions under the form of other per- 
sons; in making them transport merchandise and other goods from one place to 
another; also to employ them in causing quarrels, fights, homicides, and all 
kinds of evils, and malefic acts; also to convey letters and messages of all k inds 
from one country to another; to deliver prisoners; and in a thousand other ways 
which I have frequently experimented. 
 The se Spirits should be treated according t o their quality, and a d istinction 
should be made between a great Spirit and one of a vile or insignificant nature, 
but thou shouldest nevertheless alway conserve over them that domination 
which i s p roper u nto h im w ho o perateth. I n s peaking u nto t hem t hou s halt 
give them no title; but shalt address them sometim“eyos as u,” sometimes as 
 12. Meaning apparently the Four Princes and Eight Sub-Princes of the Demons, 
 before so often a lluded to. 
 13. Viz.: LUCIF ER, LEVIATHAN, SATAN, and BELIAL.

 Of Abramelin The Mage 
“thou”; and thou shalt never seek out expressions to please them, and thou shalt 
 14 
always have with them a proud and imperious air. 
 There be certain little terrestrial Spirits that are simply detestable; Sorcerers 
and Necromantic Magicians generally avail themselves of their services, for they 
operate only for evil, and in wicked and pernicious things, and they be of no 
use soever. He who operateth could, should he so wish, have a million such, but 
the Sacred Science which worketh otherwise than Necromancy in no way per- 
mitteth you to employ such as be not constrained by an Oath to obey you. 
 All that hath hitherto been said and laid down should suffic e, and it is 
in no wise to be doubted that he who executeth all these matters from point to 
point, and who shall have the right intention to use this Sacred Science unto 
the honour and glory of God Almighty for his own good, and for that of his 
neighbour, shall arrive with ease at the possession th ereof; and even matters the 
most difficult shall appear easy unto him. But Human Nature is so depraved 
and corrupted, and so different from that which the Lord hath created, that few 
persons, if any, do walk in the right way; and it is so easy to prevaricate, and so 
difficult not t o fail in an Operation whic h demandeth t he whole (soul of a) 
man i n (its) entirety. And in order not to intimidate in any way him who shall 
resolve to undertake this Operation, I am about here to set down in writing the 
difficulties, temptations, and hindrances which will be caused him by his own 
relatives; and all this will be occasioned by the Evil Spirits so as to avoid having 
to submit themselves, and humiliate themselves, and subject themselves unto 
Man, their greatest enemy, seeing that the y behold him in powerful condition 
arriving at the enjoyment of that Eternal Glory which they themselves have 
foolishly lost; and their rage is so great and their grief so poignant, that -there is 
in the world no evil which they be not ready to work, if God were to permit 
them, they being always attracted by the idea of the destruction of the Human 
Race. Therefore is it necessary to take courage and make a constant resolution 
to resist in all things with intrepidity, and to earnestly desire to obtain from 
God so great a Grace in despite of men and of the Demon. Also beforehand 
thou shouldest arrange thine affairs in such wise that they can in no way hinder 
thee, nor bring thee any disquietude in the period of the Six Moons, during 
which time there will occur the greatest possible attempts at assault and damage 
unto thee which the keen and subtle Enemy will bring to bear upon thee. He 
will cause thee to come in contact with evil books, and wicked persons, who by 
Diabolic methods and tricks will seek to turn thee aside from this enterprise, 
 14. In spite of what Abraham here says, I must reiterate, that the greatest courtesy 
 should always be used towards Sp’ irothitserwise the Operator will s peedily be l ed 
 into error.

 The Sacred Magick
even though it be already commenced, by bringing before thee matters which
in appearance will seem of the greatest importance, but which really be only
built up on false (and evil) foundations. To such annoying accidents thou
shouldest steadily oppose thyself, by following out carefully the ample instruc-
tions which I have given thee, thus banishing them from thee with calmness
and tranquillity so as to give no chance to the Enemy of exerci sing his fraudu-
lent tricks to interrupt thee. 
 Thy relations also, astonished at thy manner of life and thy retirement, will
make every effort to attempt to find out the reasons thereof. It will be necessary
to satisfy them by words full of affection, and to make them think that time
which engendereth change, also causeth men who are not altogether ignorant
persons t o resolve at times to live b y themselves. This b ath been the cause why
so great a number of good and learned men have retired into desert places, so
that be ing separated from their own relatives and from the world they might
live tranquilly in prayer and orisons to render themselves more worthy to
obtain through the Grace of the Lord a Gift so great and so perfect.
I Further approve of thy possessing a Bible in the vulgar language, and also
the Psalms of David, for thine own use. Some person may her“eI u renpldye:r -
stand the Latin, and I have no need of the common lang”. uI aagneswer him
that when we pray we ought not in any way to embarrass the Mind b y having
to interpret the Psalms; for at such a moment we should be as much united as
possible to God; and even the Psalms being in the vulgar tongue when one
readeth them they imprint themselves better on the memory; and this is the
true manner of particular prayer, if the person praying be illiterate, for in saying
the Psalms in Latin he would not know what he was asking of God.
In these Three Books we shall not find the slightest thing which hath not a
true and necessary foundation. And we should take the greatest care, and keep
ourselves as we would from a deadly poison, from commencing this Operation
at all, i f we have not made a firm r esolution t o carry i t through u nto the e nd.
Because (in the contrary case) some notable evil would befall him who had
(carelessly) commenced the Operation, and who would then only too well
comprehend that we may not make a mock of the Lord. Should it happen that
God by His Will and Commandment should visit thee and affl ict thee with
some malady which should render thee incapable of finishing the Operation
according un to thy wish, thou having already commenced it; then shouldest
thou l ik e a n o bedient s ervant s ubmit t hyself h umbly u nto His Holy Will and
Commandment, re serving His Grace unto the time pleasing unto His Divine

 Of Abramelin The Mage 
Majesty to grant it thee. And thou shalt cease from thine Operation, so as to 
finish it on another more favourable occasion, and m eanwhile thou shalt devote 
thyself u nto t he cure o f t hy body. A nd s uch a case o ught in n o w ay t o afflict 
thee, for the Secrets of God are impenetrable, and He performeth, permitteth, 
and operateth all things for the best and for our good, al though it may be not 
understanded of us. 
Hereinafter Will I set down the Key of this Operation, which is the only 
thing which facilitateth this Operation to enjoy the Vision of the Holy Angels, 
 15 
by placing the Symbol gs iven here after upon the brow of the Child and of 
him who performeth the Operation, as I have said in the First Book, to which 
one can easily refer. 
 I will say even as much as this, that out of an hundred scarce ly five or six 
persons can attain unto the possession of this Sacred Magic without this Key; 
for reasons which one can in no way disclose . 
 Also we should repeat the Psalm V“DomI. ine, ne in furore tuo arguas” me, 
etc. (“O Lord, afflict me not in Thine Ange”).r 
There is n othing in the World w hich we s hould so much desire a s a true Sci- 
ence , neither is there any more difficult to obtain than this one, because often 
one dieth before attaining unto it in its entirety. 
 This is the true and only Way of this Sacred Science and Magic which the 
Lord hath granted unto us by His pure mercy; and is that which in Six Months 
maketh us attain unto the most high and Occult gifts of the Lord which we can 
think of. 
 This is the True Science which comprehendeth all other Sciences once one 
is in possession thereof 
 Oh! how many books be read among us which seem wonderful! 
 It is not fitting for me even to reve al a part of this Science and its proper- 
ties; and to appropriate unto myself that which appertaine th unto a pe rson of a 
 16 
great mind and so far above m eIn. teaching it even, I have far exceeded that 
which I should have done, in having given unto thee the two last Symbols, b ut 
what will not paternal love and affection do? Endeavour only to obey me and to 
follow out my precepts from point to point, according to the manner in which 
I have given them unto thee in writing; keeping alway the Fear of God before

thine eyes. Also forget not the slightest thing which I have said unto thee in 
these Three Books, for with the help of God Who ruleth and governeth all 
things, and reigneth gloriously in Heaven an d upon Earth, and Whose Divine 
justice shineth in Hell; if thou hast recourse unto Him and puttest all thy con- 
fidence in His Divine Mercy, thou shalt obtain this Holy Science and Magic 
whose power is inexpressible. Th?en my, Son! and Whosoever may attain 
thereunto; remember to praise and glorify the Lord, and to pray unto Him that 
He may be willing to deign and accord unto me His Holy Glory, the place of 
veritable rest, whereof to me while yet in this Valley of Misery He hath granted 
a large share through His Goodness and Mercy; and I pray the Lord also that 
He m ay b e w illing t o g rant it u nto thee also w ith His Holy B enediction, a nd
unto all those who by thy means will arrive at the possession of this Sacred 
Magic, and who will use it according unto His Holy Will. 
 May God deign, say I, to grant unto such all temporal goods, and a good 
Death in His Holy Kingdom! 
 SO MAY IT BE!

Note. The above set of four Squares evidently represent the Symbols already referred
to in the Second Book (Chap. xx.), and in the concluding pages of this Third Book; as
being those to be placed on the hea d of the Operator and of the Child during the 
Angelic Invocation. The Name URIEL for the former, the Name ADAM for the lat- 
ter. But evidently, also, the Squares of numbers above are intended as the reverse sides
of the two lower ones. The La tin word HOMO is the translation of ADAM in the 
sense of Man. The Squares of numbers are not of the ordinary magica l class.
