                         Excerpt from the poem

                           "A Psalm of Life"  

                     by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow


                    Lives of great men all remind us
                    We can make our lives sublime,
                    And, departing, leave behind us
                    Footprints on the sands of Time;

                    Footprints, that perhaps another,
                    Sailing o'er life's solemn main,
                    A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
                    Seeing, shall take heart again.

breath                       physical body                     hatha

energy                       powers of nature                  shakti

self                         ecstasy                           samadhi





Western Magickal Tradition                                                                         

Asana      - stills body, sense shut-down, chakras bud

Pranayama  - stills emotions, appetites, breath energizes chakras
                        
Mantrayoga - stills mind


Yama  - moral qualities attained   &   Niyama - good works

              both of these function to still the life
              (so as not to excite the mind) and to  
              still the emotions and passions          
              (so as not to excite the mind)

Pratyahara -  inhibitory power over thoughts
              (similar to asana but power over mind/   
              thoughts rather than body)

The next 3 are inter-related:

Dharana - direction of thought/mind to a single point    
                  
Dhyana -  annihilation of the ego
          the contents of the mind consist of 2 things
          which become one; thought, time, space are
          destroyed

Samadhi - the ideal is experienced
          formlessness                
          becoming of the object (taste, sound, etc.)




Hermetic Tradition  

1.  Control of thoughts

    You must be able to decide what you think and when, to
    determine which thoughts are YOURS and which are garbage,
    to have the ability to turn your thoughts on one thing only
    and the ability to keep out stray thoughts. Also, develop the
    ability to discriminate between the essential and the non-
    essential.  This leads to the ability to discriminate
    between truth and appearance (thought independent of
    sense distortion).  This also leads to logical and                   
    sensible thought following upon thought.

2.  Control of actions

    Realize the effects of karma in your life. All actions
    should become less automatic re-actions.  Work to eliminate
    unintentional actions.

3.  Perseverance

    Do not be easily discouraged by delays on the path of
    spiritual progress.  If you make a vow, think carefully
    about it.  To plan, will, and NOT DO is Will-depleting.

4.  Tolerance

    You must develop tolerance of others, tolerance               
    of circumstances, and tolerance for Self.


5.  Faith/Impartiality

    Try to have faith and trust in all you meet.  Have
    faith in self, in your connectedness to all things, and
    in the rightness of life.  You will learn that if you
    do X then Y will follow...this develops faith in the
    power of your intentions.


6.  Inner balance

    You must maintain balance in ALL things or...that balance
    will be restored for you like it or not.  Try to retain 
    composure in joy and sorrow.  Be ready armed for all life
    brings.

7.  Love of Inner Freedom

    You must be free from an ego-centric view of life (even
    regarding your own life!)




Modern Western Tradition 

Thinking

Be aware that thoughts are things and use them with care.        
Everything which exists began as a thought.                       
Develop your imagination and use it to create goals 
because the creation of goals generates energy.
Learn to recognize the various parts of the mind,
especially the ego which often depletes energy.
Take responsibility for all your thoughts and          
work at maintaining a positive attitude. Remember
that your environment is a reflection of your
thoughts.

  
Willing   

Develop self-discipline...when you say you will do           
something know that you will.  Become a reliable         
person. Learn to trust yourself, this will lead to       
self-awareness. Be enthusiastic about life and     
your plans. This will help you to accomplish both.
Work on developing patience in all things.


Acting 

Make yourself useful in daily life to self and others.
Always finish what you start and take care of
everyday tasks including the mundane ones.       
Try to keep your eye on your goals and not get     
lost in the process of trying to attain them.
Learn to plan what you do with your time.  Make
lists of what must be done and do it.  Make sure 
your priorities are correctly ordered.
