                         THE EMERALD TABLET OF HERMES

                                      .
                                     ...
                                    .....


             True,  without falsehood, certain and most true, that which
       is above is as that which is below, and that which is below is as
       that  which  is above, for the performance of the miracles of the
       One  Thing.  And  as all things are from One, by the mediation of
       One,  so  all  things  have  their  birth  from this One Thing by
       adaptation.  The Sun is its father, the Moon its mother, the Wind
       carries  it  in  its  belly,  its nurse is the Earth. This is the
       father of all perfection, or consummation of the whole world. Its
       power is integrating, if it be turned into earth.

       Thou  shalt separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the
       gross,  suavely,  and with great ingenuity. It ascends from earth
       to  heaven and descends again to earth, and receives the power of
       the superiors and of the inferiors. So thou hast the glory of the
       whole  world;  therefore let all obscurity flee before thee. This
       is  the  strong  force of all forces, overcoming every subtle and
       penetrating  every  solid  thing. So the world was created. Hence
       were  all  wonderful  adaptations,  of  which this is the manner.
       Therefore am I called Hermes Trismegistus, having the three parts
       of  the  philosophy  of  the  whole world. What I have to tell is
       completed, concerning the Operation of the Sun.


                                            Hermes Trismegistus
