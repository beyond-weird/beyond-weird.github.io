                   The Fundamental Laws of Human Ecology

1. We're all in it together. Everyhting is connected to everything else.
You can't do just one thing. <Law of Interrelatedness>

2. The Earth and its resources are finite. or You can't get something for
nothing. <Law of Conservation of Energy>

3. As energy and other resources  are used, there is an overall decrease in
the amount of usefulness. (Second Law of Thermodynamics>

4. Everything must go somewhere-there is now away. <Law of Conservation of
Matter>

5. Up to a point, ther bigger the bettter; behond that point, the bidder
the worse. or To everything there is an optimum size. <Brontosaurus
Principle>

6. Everything is boecoming something else. <Law of Continuous Creation>

7. In most cases, the greater the diversity of a system, the greater its
stability. <The Diversity Principle>

8. Nature frequently but not always "knows" best. Note: People use
antibiotics to counter nature. <Nature knows best>
   i'm not sure i agree with this one :)

9. We shape our buildings <environment> and afterwards our buildings
<environment> shape us. - Winston Churchhill <Your Environment is You>

10. As human beings, one of our inalienable rights is the right to live in
a clean environment. <The Environmental Bill of Rights>

11. Our environment does not belong to us alone. It was used by our
forefathers, passed on to us, and we are charged with the responsibility of
passing it undamaged to all future generations. <the Rights of the Unborn>

12. All persons must be held responsible for their own pollution. <the
Responsibility of the Born>

13. All persons are created with an equal right to live in dignity and
peace and to work out a meaningful existence. Everyone is entitled to a
fair share of the world's resources-provided one is carrying one's onw
share of the resposibilities for maintaining an orderly world. <The Law of
Equtiy>

14. Comfortable living, in harmony with nature, should be each society's
goal. <the Goal of Society>

15. Our dependence on tenchnology is, today, so strong and widespread, that
we are compelled to use technology as a means for getting out of our
environmental delemma. <Technology-Part of the Problem, Part of the
Solution>
    Corollary: Good science proceeds into the unknown with caution and in
ignorance refrains

16. No national purpose however urgent, no plitical or economic necessity
however pressing can possibly justify the risk of bringiong all human
history to an end. <Give Earth a Chance>
