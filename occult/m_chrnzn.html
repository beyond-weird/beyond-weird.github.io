                    The Mass of Choronzon, by Pete Carroll

An Invocation of the personal ego or false Holy Guardian Angel, for
the purpose of casting ones entire will as an Enchantment upon
reality. Such an operation would normally qualify as an extreme act
of black magic, were it not prefaced by an initial invocation of the
formless Kia or real Holy Guardian Angle. The essential purpose of
the conjuration as a whole is to increase the dominian of ones ego
over the world in the hope of bringing the formless life force of
the Kia more fully into play. The ritual is traditionally performed
with a wand to exemplify will, although other instruments can be
used, or improvisation made with the clenched fist if necessary.

The invocations are in the Enochian language and represent in part,
adaptions of the calls of the first and tenth Enochian Aethers, and
consist of eleven and thirty three words each.

Unlike the Mass of Chaos B (Baphomet Conjuration), this ritual
cannot be aimed to enchant for any specific desire and has the
property of tending to phenomenise the desires of the ego at random.
Herein lies its use and its danger. You may only realise what it was
you wanted when it arrives.

The ritual must therefore be considered as partly an act of
Divination. Following the statement of intent, the Kia is first
invoked by an incantation, a mantra and a brief period of complete
mental silence. It would be both blasphemous and catastrophic to
attempt to conceptualise Kia as other than a formless pregnant void.
The god/daemon form of Choronzon is manifested by a visulisation of
ones self in the form of ones grossly hypertrophied ego whilst the
incantation is given. The ritual is concluded with three
simultaneous acts. A lightening flash in the form of the solar sig
or sigil or sowulo victory rune is visualised flashing down from
ones head to the ground, a loud martial arts Kia is shouted and the
wand is struck against the ground. Laughter banishing then follows.
