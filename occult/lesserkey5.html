Ars Nova – Book Five of the Lemegeton

 Ars Nova 
 Introduction 
There is some question whether thArse Nova qualifies as a separate book of the 
Lemegeto.n In my copy of the ma nuscript (S loane 2731) it consists of a single sheet 
of paper. It is only distinguished from the precedArinsg Al made bl y the word “Finis” 
at the end of that book; there is no new title for the text that follows. 
 It is my belief that the lack of a title– a nd an error at whatever time the pages 
were numbered – has caused previous publishers and commentators onAr thes N ova 
to put its two pages in the reverse of the sequence in which they should be shown. 
Using the opposite of the accepted order puts the presentation in a logical sequence, 
and clears up the mystery surrounding t“hMie ghty Oration”, which has puzzled 
previous commentators. 
 Sloane 2731 is characterized by an almost obsessive concern with conser ving 
space. Each sheet of paper is used to the maximum. The writing is minuscule. The 
margins are very narrow, and the copyist wrote in what we now c“landscaall pe” ori-
entation in order to fit as many words as possible on each line. There are only two 
places in the manuscript where as much as a half-page is left blank, and one of these 
is in theArs N ova. If the accepted order of the pages is used, this blank comes in the 
middle of the presentation, for no obvious reason. It seems more reasonable to con- 
clude that this blank comes at the end of the section, and thus at the end of the 
entire Lemegeto;n it is blank because the work is finished at that point. 
 Most of the text ofArs N ova clearly relates to the first book of theLem egeto,n 
the Goetia, and the“ tools of the trad”e described therein: the magickal circle and tri- 
angle, the hexagrams within the circle and the pentagrams surrounding it. It lists the 
divine names written in each of these, and adds a short prayer, with one line of 
prayer per name. This list takes up the entire first page. I believe that the prayers 
were to be spoken either while drawing the divine names and figures, or later while 
consecrating the place of the work. 
 On the opposite side of the sheet, there are three sections. In the first, several 
sets of Hebrew characters are shown with accompanying names in the Latin alpha- 
bet. The latter do not appea r to be transliterations of the Heb–re whw ich, in any 
case, is only partly legible. 
 The second section is a prayer that incorporates some of the Latin-alphabet 
words from the previous section. But it actually makes more sense with those words 
excised: it is a prayer to god to confine evil and aerial spirits in a brass urn. This 
immediately brings to mind the brass vessel of Solomon, shown inGo theeti a. Possi- 
bly this is a prayer to be said while consecrating or preparing such a vessel. However, 
the divine names in this prayer are not those shown on the vessel in my copy of the 
manuscript, nor those on the vessel in the Crowley/Mathers edition ofGo theet ia. 
Possibly this section is a borrowing from some document outsideLe theme geto tran -
dition; the extreme corruption of the divine names would suggest it. 
 With the order of the pages reversed, the final section is“ thMieght y Oration”. 
Nelson White puzzles over this invoca tion, wondering whether the magician is sup-

posed to address the Spirit as if it were a thief. The expla nation is simple; it is not 
part of the Lemegeton as such. Rather, this section is a curse directed against any 
person who steals the book in which it is written. Such curses were common in the 
times when books were reproduced by hand; the time and effort it took to copy them 
made them much more valuable commodities than our modern mass-produced vol- 
umes. Its presence in this position is the final confirmation that the order of the 
pages has been reversed. 
 It should be noted than in the Introductory Description of theLem egeto (pn re-
sented in theGo etia volume of this series) this book is sometimes erroneously titled 
Ars Notoria. The Notoria is a separate (and much more complex) w ork, the text of 
which was included ( without its vitally important illustrations) as an appendix in one 
copy of theLe megeto. n

 1. The divine names in this section are all written in the peripher y of the Circ le of Art, 
 shown in the Go etia. 
 2. It is uncertain what the“H ” abbreviates. The names all refer to the Sphere of Saturn. 
 3. The copyist mistook a“d ” in the diagram of the circle for a“ln” , here and in the name 
 Zelez, which should be“Ze deq”.
