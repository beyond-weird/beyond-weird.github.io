                                     Death Psi

           Does approaching death make our psychic abilities more acute?

       According to British  psychologist  Keith Hearne, head of the Hearne
       Research Organization in North Humberside,  England,  the answer may
       be yes.

       To find out for sure, Hearne has begun 2 investigations  of his own.
       In the first  study,  terminally  ill people are asked to take tests
       that will rate their ESP capabilities.   "We  will  pick  out images
       from cards or pictures," he says.  "Then we will attempt to transmit
       the images to the terminally ill at specific times, probably twice a
       day.  The results  will be plotted back from the moment  of  death,"
       Hearne adds.  "I  expect  to  see  an  upward  turn  in psi as death
       approaches."

       The second study will focus on memories  and perceptions reported by
       those who have been, for a moment at least, clinically dead. To test
       hearing during death,  for  instance,  Hearne's  group  will  ask  a
       hospital medical team  to play random, prerecorded words and phrases
       at the moment of death.  If the patient  revives,  he or she will be
       asked to recall the words.

       Hearne admits it may be difficult to gain the cooperation of doctors
       and hospital administrators.  But he plans to circumvent  objections
       from the medical establishment "by appealing to the public at large.
       To choose to  participate is up to the individual's own conscience,"
       he says.  "I know if I were dying, I would be only too happy to take
       part in a parapsychological experiment."

       Hearne asks terminally ill people  interested  in  participating  in
       psychic research to  contact him at Box 84, Hull, North  Humberside,
       England, HU1 2E.
