Allium sativum - Garlic  (Liliaceae)

Parts used - bulb. Fresh juice is most effective.

Constituents - contains volatile oil which is composed of allicin
and sulphur related compounds plus citral, geraniol, etc.
Allicin is the major odour principle and taste of garlic, It is
generated by action of the enzyme alliinase on alliin. Under
normal conditions alliinase and alliin are separated from each
other inside the garlic bulb. However when the bulb is cut or
crushed, the two are brought together and allinase turns alliin (
a non volatile odorless sulfur amino acid) into allicin( a
pungent volatile sulphur compound.

- also contains enzymes, mucilage, protein and lipids.
- also contains selenium-best known source, has antioxidant
activity.

Properties- alterative, stimulant, diaphoretic, expectorant,
antiseptic, antibiotic, antispasmodic, cholagogue, vulnerary,
vermifuge.

- the ingredient allicin inhibits growth of various bacteria,
fungi, amoebas.

- inhibits production of harmful bacteria in the colon, for
influenza, common cold and any types of viral infections. 

- is natural penicillin - it has only 1% of the impact of
penicillin but it is more effective with gram negative bacteria
than penicillin.

- lowers blood pressure and blood cholesterol- use garlic oil for
earaches.

- for prevention and elimination of heavy metal poisoning from
the body on a daily basis-due to sulphur content.

- is rubefacient and use as poultice in acute pectoral and
abdominal inflammation and for drawing pustules and boils to a
head- for canker sores
