 Introduction 
This collection of essays, written between 1988-95, deals with
aspects of the practice of magical evocation. My first lengthy
foray into this much-misunderstood aspect of magic was a 
personal magical retirement inspired by accounts of magicians 
working the Abra-melin system, but perhaps more influenced 
in execution by the work of Austin Osman Spare and the 
Industrial art movement. My experiences in this retirement are
recounted in the first essayH, owling. At the core of this essay is
the identification of cognitive-emotional-behavioural constructs
as discrete entities - Personal Demons, if you will - a subject
which I have dealt with in more user-friendly detail in Condensed
Chaos (New Falcon Publications, 1995). The next phase of work 
concer ned the evocation ofS ervitor (lit:s a peson wr ho serves
another), prompted by a brief paragraph in Peter J. Carroll’s 
book, Liber Null (Morton Press, 1978). Working with the magical
g roup, Circl e of Star, Is developed a simple, generic approach to
creating and evoking magical servitors. The basics of this 
approach are presented in the Servitor essas y, f ollowed by both
an example of a rather successful servitor, and an approach to
what I have chosen to call, “Functional Spirits” which requires
no ritual tr appings w hatsoe ve r. The thir d phase of w ork 
concerned the more ‘traditional’ forms of evocation. Together 
with a colleague, Fra. GosaA, I embarked on a “Goetia Project”
- the aim being to experiment with various approaches to the 
evocation of spirits, beginning with the Lesser Key of Solomon
the King. Some observations on our results with the entities of
the Lesser Key of Solomon are enclosed. 
During this project, I found my interests returning to a recurrent
obsession - the entities of the Cthulhu Mythos. The final essay,
E voking Yg-Sothotho , (originall y written f or the jour nal of the
Esoteric Order of Dagon) is an attempt to pull together a 
 5

theoretical model relating to mythos entities, earth lights, and
other factors. At the time of writing this, I was very much into
creating ‘theoretical models’ prior to embarking on practical
projects. 
In a way, I was prompted to ‘specialise’ in methods of Evocation
by virtue of the fact that at the time, I hadn’t encountered much
in the way of useful information concerning this magical practice.
In the minds of some occultists, evocation seems inextricably
linked with ‘calling up demons’ and the notion that it constitutes
‘black magic’ - a notion much in favour with those who have
been exposed to too many Dennis Wheatley novels! Fortunately,
the rise of a more eclectic approach to practical magic, in which
I feel the so-called Chaos Magic movement has palyed a
significant part, has done much to banish the old dogmas
surrounding what is after all, a very practical and useful set of
magical techniques.

 Howling 
 “Mayhem speaks louder than w ords.”
 Brother Moebius B., L.O.O.N.
The Babblogue: 
A deliberate derangement of the senses - orchestrating a personal
cacophony; a descent into the depths of the subconscious, to
confront and bind the ‘lurkers’ within. 
 This essay is a short account of a personal exploration of the
‘demons’ of my own psyche. Rather than relying on existing
approaches, for the reasons given below, I preferred to develop
a purely personal approach. I give this account not to foist this
particular approach onto others, but in the hope that it will
assist those who are experimenting with different techniques.
Nor do I wish to invalidate the traditional systems of Goetic
magic, merely to say that while some may be satisfied to follow
the maps of Abra-Melin or Crowley, this is not the case for me.
 This work began fairl y innocuously, with the compilation of
a ‘blac k book’ - a dissection of self, in ter ms of h abits,
shortcomings, faults, hopes, ideals, all that I was, that I wished
to be, or rejected. Likes, dislikes, attractions and revulsions.
Then on to self-portraits; written in the third person - positive,
ne gative, neutral portrayals, a curriculum vitae, an obituary. To
this was added a “Book of Blunders” - every mistake or
embarrassing moment that could be dredged up, cuttings from
school reports, photographs and letters which brought back
painful memories. 
 Choice extracts from this catalogue were read onto tapes, and
the ta pes scr ambled to g ether to f orm cut-up sequences . A
deliberate attempt at psychic surgery this - smashing the vessel
in order to remould it. 
 7 



--------------------------------------- 8

 Then on to the mundane arrangements. Seclusion from
others, as of old, a necessity - that one’s demons do not trouble
the unwary visitor, and more practically, that one is not chanced
upon, mistaken for a psychotic, and incarcerated.
 As for food, I decided to rely on simple nutritious fare,
sustaining and easy to prepare, with a stack of Pot Noodles as
chemical aids. Drugs? Who needs them? Still, a selection of
natural substances can aid things along.
 T he T emple: blac k, unadorned, windowless, but not
uncluttered! Around its confines I heaped all kinds of junk.
Sheets of hardboard, rubbish from a building skip, a bucket of
clay, bottles, broken radio sets, a spray-gun. Everything I might
need, plus a few more things besides.
Bringing forth the dweller within - its name is legion.
I was preparing for a descent into the labyrinth, to make known
my ‘forgotten ones’, with only the thinnest of cords with which
to map the maze. 
 Why risk insanity in such a way? This is the inner journey, the
whale’s bell y, the f east of the ravening ones. Why g o alone,
without the security of tried and tested banishings and sigils?
Well I don’t trust those old books, those mad monks with their
Necronomicons, dead names and blasphemous sigils. What price
forbid den kno wledge? About £4.50 in pa perbac k actuall y.
Ridiculous! So I set forth to compile a ‘living’ grimoire. A product
of the technocratic aeon, I use its debris to mould my dreams.
“The Howling” - the hiss, roar and static screams of radios tuned
to dead channels. 
 To the work then. Some loose structure being required (or so
I thought), I devised a hierarchy based on the work of
psychologist Abraham Maslow - ranging from ‘survival demons’
such as hunger or thirst, working up towards ‘Ego’ demons - the
need for self-respect or a particular self-image, and more abstract
conceptions: the hunger for knowledge or wisdom. The deeper
the level of the hierarchy, the more primal the desires and urges.
 The techniques: flooding and vomiting (eating and excreting)
- to flood awareness with specific images, to bring forth (evoke)
the demon, giving it form, “flesh” and eventually a name or a
 8



--------------------------------------- 9

sigil. The scrambled personality tapes were to act as auditory
sigils - storms of emotion whipped up by intensive remembering
(replaying) sets of memories. Letting loose the hyenas of
cynicism on a cherished ideal or goal. 
 The means of Gnosis: sensory overload, hyperventilation,
old f avourites suc h as hung er, thir st, exhaustion. 120 hour s
without sleep produces a fine paranoic ‘edge’ to consciousness.
 Cohering the images that welled up from within - using finger-
painting, moulding clay mixed with body f luids and excreta,
sculpture using broken glass; and the more usual methods; sigils,
auto-writing , taking a line f or a w alk. By these means the
Forgotten Ones take shape. hese T ‘psychographs’ accumulate
in corners of the temple, and it takes on the clutter of an Austin
Osman Spare print. 
 Alas, these psychographs fall far short of the images and visions
that flicker around me. “Another pile of Shit for the ledger?” I
scream and take a hammer to them, only to collapse exhausted
and retching on the temple floor. The red lines of the yantra-
circuit on the floor seem at that moment to be particularly
mocking and indifferent to my efforts. There is a kind of
‘wrenching’ feeling in my head, the snap of vertebrae being
twisted, a helpless animal having its neck wrung, and I begin to
howl the names that erupt from my throat…
 And the jackals rushed in to feed, and I laughed when I saw
them ‘cos they all wore my face. 
 I came back from that moment into a kind of calm detachment
- ‘emptied’ momentarily of any further feeling. I walked around
the temple, as though seeing the debris for the first time, sifting
carefully through the mess, examining each half-finished piece
as though it wasn’t anything to do with me. Some I was able to
give names to - “you are Uul, the fear of failure”, “you are
Hamal, guilt not yet erased.” This was the beginning of the
formation of an alphabet of binding. 
 The second half of this operation consisted of experimenting
with this alphabet, binding the demons into magical weapons
for later use. When the initial phase of the work was done, I
 9 



--------------------------------------- 10

slept for about 18 hours, and awoke clear of the frenetic delirium
which had been built up. 
Commentary 
The Hierarchy of Human Needs 
Traditionally, Demons and Devils are organised according to
ranks and hierarchies with “Princes” ruling lesser demons. The
grimoires seem to imply that if Hell exists, then it is a
bureaucracy, and so by the same token, Earthly bureaucracies
are demonic structures - as anyone who has had any dealings
with the DHSS will readily testify. 
 The hierarchy used in the Babblogue was developed by the
psychologist Abraham Maslow, to show how the various levels
of ‘need’ influence behaviour and motivation. His hierarchy
of Human Needs is a pyramid of desires, ranging from
biological survival needs (food, shelter, etc.) to more complex
needs: 
 Biological hunger, thirst, w armth
 Safety i.e. freedom from fear
 Affiliative to be given consideration
 Esteem status, praise, belonging
 Cognitive intellectual stimulation
 Aesthetic culture, art 
 Self-Actualization self-knowledge 
 According to Maslow, the needs at one level must be at least
partially fulfilled before those on the next level become
important - so aesthetic needs are not usually high on the list
when one is star ving.One can become ‘possessed’ by one’s
survival demons, and consequentially able to perform actions
one would otherwise not consider. Air crash survivors resorting
to cannibalism is an extreme example of this. 
 In attempting to strip away the layers of my own psyche in
this way, I was struck by the ‘Russian-doll’ nature of the demons
- that the roots of a cognitive value could be traced downwards
into the levels of self-esteem, affiliation, and survival needs.
 10 



--------------------------------------- 11

This idea seems to be implied in the zoomorphic image of the 
man-beast. If we deny our demons then they are indeed ‘outside’ 
and the self becomes a fortress, for an army at war with itself. In 
contrast, the Babblogue is a trial by catharsis, to understand 
and unify the dwellers within, rather than deny or subjugate 
them. 
 T he Shaman ’s Jour ney 
The central theme of all ‘magical retirements’ of this nature is 
the journey within. Shamans world-wide, and the most powerful 
religious myths are concerned with this descent into chaos - the 
confrontation with death, the demon feast, trial by fire, 
communion with the dead - and the subsequent return - the 
realisation of power, and the subsequent return to Human affairs 
as an initiate. The core elements in this process can be 
summarised as follows: 
Phase of Departure: Summons to depart, seperation from 
mundane life, descent. 
Phase of Initiation: Ordeals, the labyrinth, womb, whales’ belly, 
guides and allies. 
Illumina tion/Transformation 
Phase of Return: Rebirth, return to world. 
Mastery 
 A wareness of this pr ocess is a centr al theme of the
contemporary approach to development which has come to be 
known as Chaos Magick, an approach which focuses on the 
examination and removal of belief structures, the cultural 
conditioning which defines our experience of the world. 
Deliberate self-wounding, to facilitate a retur n tthe o ‘union’ 
with Cosmos and Chaos that we initially feel that we have ‘lost’. 
The benefits of this experience is an increased ability to survive, 
not by fighting the environment or becoming passively resigned 
to what happens to you, but understanding the basic unity of 
self and environment, and the extent to which one can be a 
self-deter mining agent.

 Servitors
A Servitor is an entity consciously created or generated, using
evocatory techniques, to perform a task or service. In the Western
Esoteric Tradition, such entities are sometimes referred to as
‘T hought-Forms’, whilst in Tibetan magic, for example, they
are known as ‘Tulpas’. Servitor s can be usefully deployed to
perform a wide range of tasks or functions on your behalf.
 Servitors can be created to work with one particular situation
or event or, alternatively, Servitors can be created which have a
g eneral provenance in one area, such as healing.
 There are a number of advantages to using more generalised
Servitors. Firstly, they can be regarded as ‘expert’ systems which
learn from being given a task to execute - as if the more healing
tasks you give a servitor, the better it seems to become at healing.
Secondly, continued use of the Servitor, with successful results,
builds up “confidence” in it’s activity on the part of those who
use it. With a more g eneralised Servitor, anyone who knows its
activation sequence (such as a mantra, sigil, or visualisation
sequence) can employ it to work at a given task. One example
of this form of Servitor is the entity ICANDOO. ICANDOO
(“I-can-do”) was created at an open group workshop in Servitor
creation. The name of the Servitor was also its mantra for
summoning it, and it’s general brief was to assist those wh o
used it for overcoming any obstacles that crossed them.
ICANDOO was created by a group of 12 people, and all of
them used the Servitor throughout the day, to assist them with
problems of one sort or another. In the design sequence, the
Servitor was given the ability to divide itself holographically, so
that each segment contained the powers and abilities of the
original entity. 
 On a still further level of generalisation, you can create
Servitors who have no specific function or provenance, saving
 13



--------------------------------------- 14

that they serve to increase the success of one’s own magics.
Such servitors can be used in both major and minor acts of
magic, and are particularly useful in acts of enchantment,
divination, or illumination. 
Servitor De pendenc y 
It is generally held that each usage of a Servitor serves to ‘feed’
it, and that each result which is rated as a success, serves to
enhance it’s power. It is also a good idea to get into the habit of
attributing any occurrences within the sphere of activity of that
Servitor, to it’s w ork. This can lead to problems, though. In
1992 I created a Servitor called “Eureka.” It’s given sphere of
activity was that of Illumination - inspiration, new ideas, the
boosting of creativity and brainstor ming in general. Initially,
the Servitor exceeded all my expectations of it’s performance. I
used it to stimulate new ideas for writing, lecturing and facilitating
seminars & workshops. With a colleague, it became a focus for
brainstorming - acting as a Third Mind arising from conversation.
Each time we made a creative leap, or an idea formed became
something workable in practice, the power of the Servitor was
boosted. In 1993, the activity of Eureka was linked with the
Neptune-Uranus conjunction with the result that, on April 22nd,
as Neptune & Uranus began to retrograde, Eureka went “off-
line.” 
 The immediate result of this was that I suddenly found it
much harder to get into a flow of creative thinking. It seemed
that Eureka had become such a dominant element in the
dynamics of my own creative process that, once it was removed,
I found it much harder to get into the appropriate frame of
mind. I had become dependent upon the Servitor. Eventually,
the Servitor was recalled and disassembled in such a way that a
‘splinter’ of it’ s original po wer sur v i ved as a f ocus f or
illumination. Having been made wiser by this experience, I
only occasionally use this fragment of the original servitor as a
focus for creativity. 
Vi ral Servitor s 
It is possible to instruct Servitors to replicate or reproduce
 14 



--------------------------------------- 15

themselves. Approaches to this include instructing the Servitor
to replicate itself as a form of cell-division, replication which
follows cybernetic or viral parameters, or to create a servitor
which ‘gives birth’ according to particular parameters, such as
time-units, astrological transits, or each time the target of the
Servitor carries out a particular behaviour. An early test of this
concept was that of a Servitor despatched to assist in the recovery
of property being withheld from it’wners o . Once a set deadline
had been passed, the Servitor began to generate a field of
‘confusion’ - lost keys, electrical blowouts & other minor but
annoying problems. After a second set deadline, the Servitor
began to replicate itself, so that the confusion field generated
was intensified. As soon as the recipient of the Servitor returned
the pr oper ty he had been withholding fr om it’ s owner, the
Servitors ceased to function. Evidence of the Servitors’ action -
the intensification of minor problems escalating into strange
poltergeist-type phenomenon, was gathered by talking to
associates of the target. 
 Viral Servitor s are par ticularl y appropriate f or long-ter m
enchantments, such as increasing the probability of one’s magic
being successful, or being used in healing & general protection
workings. 
 SE RVI TOR DESIGN SEQ UENCE
 1. Define General Intent 
 The first step in designing a Servitor is to decide the general
sphere of influence into which your intention falls, such as
healing, protection, binding, harmony, luck, divination, mood
enhancement, success in ...., and so forth.
 Defining your general intent will assist you if you wish to use
symbols & magical correspondences in creating your servitor.
For example, if you were interested in creating a servitor to act
within the spher e of Healing, then you could assemb le any
associations, symbols, emotions, memories, etc which you relate
to the conce pt of Healing. By consulting a book of magical
correspondences such as ‘777’, you could build up chains of
correspondences - planetary figures, scents, colours, planetary
 15



--------------------------------------- 16

hours etc. How far you go in this direction is very much a matter
of personal choice. 
 2. Defining Specific Intent 
 Here, you are creating the core of the Servitor’s purpose the
Statement of Intent which is analogous to the Servitor’s aetheric
DNA. Formul ating the Ser vitor’ s Sta tement of Intent ma y
necessitate a good deal of self-analysis into your motivations,
desires, realistic projections of goals, etc. As in all sorcery
operations, it is appropriate to ask advice from your preferred
form of di vina tion. To contin ue the e xample of a Healing
Servitor, an appropriate Statement of Intent might be:
 “To promote rapid recovery and health in ...(name)...”
 Once you have determined the appropria te Intent to form
the basis of your Servitor, then the Statement can be rendered
into a sigil, or glyph.. 
 3. What Symbols Are A pp ropria te to the Serask?vitor’s T
 There is a wealth of magical & mythic symbols which you
can draw upon when creating a servitor, which can be used to
represent different qualities, abilities and attributes. There is
also the symbolism of colour, smell, sound & other sensory media
to draw upon. In order to refine the ‘program’ which forms the
basis for your servitor further, you could embellish the sigil by
adding other symbols. 
 4. Is ther e a Time Factor to Consider?
 Here, you should consider the dur ation of the Ser vitor’s
operation. In other words, do you want the Servitor to be
‘working’ continuously, or only at specific periods? Here, you
may wish to take into account phases of the moon, astrological
conjunctions or planetary hours, for example, which could be
added into the Servitor’s symbolic instructions. The Healing
Servitor above for example, was instructed to be active for a
period of seven days, affecting it’s tar get recipient for seven
minutes, at seven hour intervals. This instruction serves to
reinforce the number symbolism & association with harmony.
 It is also at this point that you should consider what happens
 16



--------------------------------------- 17

after the Servitor has performed its task. It is generally held to
be preferable that when a Servitor has completed its task, the
Servitor should be disassembled by its creator. There are two
approaches to doing this. Firstly, one can encode a “self-destruct”
instruction into the Servitor at the time of it’s creation, where
the duration of its existence is defined in terms of the duration
of its task, or the fulfilment of a specific condition.
 The other a pproach to disassemb ly is to perf orm a ritual
‘reabsorption’ of the Servitor, mentally drawing it back from it’s
task, taking it apart by visualization, taking back the original
desire which sparked it’s creation, and taking apart or destroying
any material base which you have created for it. Whilst classical
occult theory has it that if you do not look after your thought-
forms, they will wander around the astral plane annoying people,
there is good psychological sense for ter minating the ‘lif e’ of
Servitors which have completed their assigned task - that you
are reclaiming responsibility for that desire-complex which you
used to create the Servitor. 
 5. Is A Name Required? 
 The Servitor can be given a name which can be used, in
addition to its sigil, for creating, powering, or controlling it. A
name also acts to further create a Servitor’s persona. A name
can reflect the Servitor’s task, or be formed from a mantric sigil
of it’s Statement of Intent. 
 6. Is a Material Base Required? 
 The Material base is some physical focus for the Servitor’s
existence. This can help to define the Servitor as an individual
entity, and can be used if you need to recall the Servitor for any
reason. Examples of a material base include bottles, rings,
crystals, small figurines as used in fantasy role-playing or figures
crafted from modelling compounds. Bodily fluids can be applied
to the material base to increase the perceived link between
creator and entity. This is very much a matter of personal taste.
Alternatively, the Servitor can remain freely mobile as an aetheric
entity. I tend to find that one-shot, task-specific servitors can be
left as aetheric entities, whilst for entities which have more of
 17



--------------------------------------- 18

along-term use, a material base is often helpful. For others, it 
might be possible to link their use to a specific, identifiable, 
state of consciousness, which forms part of the core associations 
which one builds up for a Servitor. 
 It is also possible to link a Servitor to a specific smell, such as 
a perfume or essential oil, so that each time the oil is applied, 
the Servitor is activated. This can be particularly useful when 
cr eating Ser vitor s for g eneral Healing, Protection, or
enhancement of a particular mood. A dab of the perfume can 
be put onto the Servitor’s material base, and the perfume should 
be inhaled during the launch of the entity. 
 7. Is a Specific Shape Required? 
 Servitors can be created to have any desired shape, from tiny 
homunculi to morphic spheres capable of extruding any required 
appendage. The shape you choose to identify with this particular 
thought-form can add another level of representational identity 
to the entity. A common practice though, is to visualiz e the 
Servitor as a featureless sphere, pulsing with energy, gwinglo 
with appropriately chosen colours, into which has been 
impressed, it’s sigilised instructions.

 GoHu Servitor 
This short essay is an account of one of my most successful
servitors to date. 
 The twin spirits of gossip and rumour have followed me about
ever since I started ‘doing things’ on the UK magical scene.
Rumours ranging from alleg ations of afiliaf tion to ‘dark’ satanic
groups to upheavals in my sex-life have whirled around and in
some instances, ended up in the pages of pagan ‘zines. Back in
the late 80’sP, agan At T he Hearmat gazine announced to their
readers that I had become ‘celibate’, and followed this up with
the announcement that they could name the ‘lady’ who
overcame my will - unfortunately, they got not only the name
but also the gender of the person concerned wrong, but I suppose
it’s the thought that counts! 
 At times I have become both paranoid and pissed off by the
rumours I heard circulating about myself. During a particularly
bad phase of feeling like this, I started working on a Gossip
Hunter-Seek er-Killer ser vitor, whose task w ould be to hover
around on the astral, detecting gossip and firing off a missile
containing some suitably horrible runic curse. I actually got as
far as ‘testing’ this entity - firing off a ‘blank’ missile at an
unsuspecting colleague - just to see if it worked the way I wanted
it to - before realising that I was going a teensy wee bit over the
top about the whole thing. 
 Instead of thinking, “Get the Bastards” I began to look at the
whole issue of gossip & rumour in a new light. After all, if
people are talking about you ‘behind your back’, they could be
said to be feeding you energy. As Terry Pratchett & Neil Gaiman
wisely note in Good Omens: “Notoriety wasn’t as good as fame,
but was heaps better than obscurity.” Bearing this in mind, I
 19 



--------------------------------------- 20

decided to create a servitor that actively worked to generate
gossip and rumour, rather than counter it. After all, what’s worse,
being talked about - or not being talked about? Those magicians
who leap to the defensive of their parent organisation every
time someone drops a snide remark about them being paranoid
would do well to remember this, and count themselves bloody
lucky that people bother to think about them at all! I do
remember, whilst being a member of a certain larg e international
magical order, some guy approaching me and hesitantly asking
“Is it true that to join the *.*.*. you have to be able to visualise
an object so that other people can see it too?” Naturally I said
nothing to deny or confirm this. Of course, this is the sort of
rumour one likes to hear about one’s organisation. But if you
want people to think this sor t of thing, you also have to be
prepared to accept the people who accuse you of being closet
Christians or not eating babies or whatever. Its’ a sort of Dayside/
Backside Tree of Lifemeta phor, I guess. Particularly as if you
continually deny anything that’s even a bit dodgy, people will
suss out that you’re talking through your backside. A few years
ago, at the Ox ford T helemic Symposium, a delegation from the Temple
of Set did a presentation on how nice they really all were. Their
spokesperson mentioned some of the rumours circulating -
animal sacrifices, rent boys, drugs etc. and dismissed them all,
saying that the TOS had been unfairly maligned. Sitting there,
I thought, well w hat’s the point then? I’ d have been mor e
impressed if they’d said - “Yes we do do unspeakab le rituals
with sheep and street urchins - and WHY NOT?”
 Anyhow, I ended up deciding that gossip about me was, by
and large, not all that bad. Not only are people feeding me
‘power’, they’re also doing some P . R. - and (though this is
stretching the idea somewhat) - some of the rumours might act
like a kind of enchantment - without me having to do anything.
I’d already heard two rumours about me owning various shops
in Leeds, you see. So GoHu’s task was to encourage people to
talk about me, and generate rumours - and ensure that I got to
hear about it eventually. Now as I’ve said, by the time I g ot
around to doing this, there was some level of gossip/rumour
 20



--------------------------------------- 21

being generated anyway. So all GoHu had to act as a kind of
‘amplifier’ as well as receiving rumours and beaming them in
my direction. 
 T he Rumour s 
 Since GoHu became active, the following tales have reached
back to my shell-like ears: 
 1. That I have a castle in the South of France (!)
 2. That I own the Atlantis Bookshop in London (!)
 3. That I am, in reality, Peter J. Carroll (!!)
 4. That I was putting in a bid to buy a Goth nightclub in
Birmingham (someone actually rang me up to ask me if this
was ‘true’!) 
 5. T hat I apparently sodomize former Chaos Inter national editor
Ian Read on a regular basis.(!) 
 6. That I am a blood-drinking ‘vampire’ - this ‘fact’ is
recounted in 2 books - Hearts o f Dknessar by John Parker (a so-
called ‘investigative journalist’ who purports to examine modern
occultism - in the wake of the ‘Satanic Child Abuse’ scare) and
T he World’s Gre atest Unsolv ed Mysteries - I forget the authors offhand,
but they are involved with ASSAP and the Society for Psychical
Research. This one stems from a short story w hich deals with
vampiric themes published in Chaos Inter n ational, entitled D‘ roplets’.
As it was written in the first person, apparently some people
have chosen to believe it was me baring my soul. Oh dear!

 Functional Spirits 
One approach to Evocation is working with Spirits which have 
a provenance over a particular situation or experience. Entities 
such as these are detailed in grimoires such Tashe Lesser K ey of
Solomon the King which are handbooks of spirits, giving details of 
spirits’ typical forms, names, sigils, and how to conjure them. 
The spirits in books such as the Lesser Key have bizarre names, 
even more bizarre appearances, yet their powers are directly 
functional and useful. For e xample , RAUM appear s as a 
blackbird, and can create love, reconcile enemies, or destroy 
cities and reputations. 
 The standard approach to summoning these spirits is to use 
the time-honoured magical ritual, wherein the entities are called 
forth into a triangle, and ceremonially bound to the magician’s 
will. However, there is also another possibility, which is simply 
that of summoning a Spirit when you find yourself in an 
appropriate situation. The following example illustrates this 
process. 
 All of us, at one time or another, suffer from being stuck in 
traffic, from freeway jams to slow-moving queues of people. 
Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to whistle up the assistance of a 
spirit which enabled you to start moving? A big hand please 
folks for the spirit GOFLOWOLFOG, the spirit who eases traffic 
blockag es so that you can continue your journey. Goflowolfog 
typically appears in the form of a shades-wearing cat riding a 
skateboard. He brings with him a wind, and a noise which sounds 
like “Neeeohttps://. ” He is of a cool, stylish disposition. 
 Gowflowolfog can be summoned when you are in a situation 
which falls under his governance, such as being stuck in a very 
crowded train (during a heatwave) which in accordance with 
the snafu principle, has stopped and shows no sign of moving 
again. In such a situation, listen out for the “Neeohttps://” and 
 22 



--------------------------------------- 23

watch out for Goflowolfog as he zips past you on his skateboard,
leaving the ghost-sensation of a breeze. If nothing else, this act
of summoning may take your mind off sources of stress - such
as the desire to murder the guy with the boom-box standing
next to you as you slowly melt in the heat of the carriage. As
the spirit slides past you, attract his attention by transfmingor
yourself (if only inwardly) into a dude who is almost as cool
and stylish as Goflowolfog himself, and visualise yourself for a
moment standing with him on the skateboard as it flashes
through the blockage. Then let go of the ‘vision’ and relax,
allowing the spirit to get on with his job. 
 If you should summon Goflowolfog to get the traffic around
you moving, and he performs his task (even if you only move a
few yards), then you are beholden to offer him something in
return (it’s only good manners). While there are many forms of
appeasement to spirits, the two most pleasing to Gowflowolfog
are firstly, to allow someone else space to move. This could take
the form of stepping back to let someone who is in a hurry walk
past you, or allowing another car driver to move into your lane
by leaving him a space. Secondly, be kind to the next cat you
see. 
 Where does Goflowolfog come from? He was identified and
assembled during a magical seminar in London, on an evening
when Britain was experiencing a heat-wave, and everyone who
had attended the seminar had experienced traffic problems in
getting there. The design sequence was as follows: 
 1. General Situation: Traffic 
 2. Function - related to situation:Easing T raffic stoppages
 3. Naming the Spirit - several suggestions were made for an
appropriate name, and GO FLOW was chosen. This name was
made suitably ‘barbaric’ by mirroring it, so becoming
GOFLOWOLFOG. 
 4. Shape of the Spirit - a number of possible shapes were
suggested, such as a wheel or set of traffic signals, but the image
of a cat riding a skateboard was both memorable, and similar
to the bizarre incongruous shapes accorded to spirits in the
grimoires. 
 23 



--------------------------------------- 24

 5. Disposition or Character of the Spirit: it was decided that
Goflowolfog could be nothing but cool, stylish and relaxed,
speedy and graceful. It was felt that he would respond kindly to
anyone who attempted to take on these qualities in a situation
as frustrating as being stuck in a traffic jam.
 The sound associated with the movement of the spirit can
also act as a mantra to help call him to you. His sigil, a circle
containing two opposite-running arrows, can be used as a
talisman, placed on cars, cycles or other modes of transport to
draw the favour of Goflowolfog or as a focus for evocation.
 Using this process, you could easily create your own grimoires
of helpful spirits. It can be interesting (and fun!) to do this with
a group of friends, so that not only are the spirits ‘assembled’
by many people, they are also used in different ways. The more
successful uses of the spirit that are reported, the more
‘confidence’ in the spirit will be raised. Given time and wide
usage, it may even happen that the image of your spirit enters
the general cultural meme-pool. If you ever see a report in the
National Enquirer or Fortean Times about sightings of cats riding
skateboards, remember Goflowolfog!

 Some Observations from The Goetia Project 
T he Goetia Pr oject w as the title of as long-ter m project
undertaken by myself and a colleague in 1989. Our original
aim was to work through a series of ‘traditional’ grimoires and,
following assessments and analysis of our findings, create a
general approach to Goetia suitable for our post-modern era.
Needless to say, things did not go exactly as we planned.
 Our first series of workings was drawn from the Lesser Key of
Solomon. Our first evocation, of the spirit Vassago, was performed
without using the traditional arrangement of circle, triangle,
etc. ‘Just to see what happened, as it were’. The result was that
the working lacked clear definition; visions of the spirit called
forth were hazy at best, and we both experienced a lowering of
vitality (a feeling of being ‘drained’), headaches and pre-flu-
like symptoms for a couple of days following. In view of this,
we constructed a permanent circle and triangle, according to
the ‘ules’r in the lesser Key, and all workings were conducted in
the fashion outlined in the lesser Key. 
 Using the long conjurations and constraints to the spirit given
in the Lesser K ey itself is exhilartinga . The long sentences ,
punctuated by the Old Testament names of God and Biblical
quotations, quickly raises excitement to a fever pitch, and once
the spirit can be discerned, it must then be abjured to remain
within the Triangle of Art. The shapes which the spirits assumed
were rarely exactly that described within the lesser Key (hereafter
LK), but general ly similar. We found tha t once a spirit had
appeared to us in a particular form, then it more or less took
that shape in subsequent evocations. 
 Once evoked, a spirit would then be questioned bout its
nature, qualities, and how we could improve upon the evocation-
environment. In one instance, we questioned the spirit Vassago
about the optimum time for evoking him. He made reply by
 25 



--------------------------------------- 26

showing us a sundial, hourglass and skull. We further tested
him by requiring him to give me a vision of where my colleague
would be the following afternoon. I was promptly given a clear
vision of walking through long corridors filled with people and
lined with lockers, of going up a flight of stairs and walking
into a room, which was full of boxes - but at this point, the
vision became unc lear. My collea gue later told me tha t the
building I had ‘seen’ was Leeds ytecPolhnic, and that the room
with ‘boxes’ (where the vision had become unclear) was he
computer department! This led us to feel that computers were
outside the experience of Vassago, as were digital watches.
 Whilst working through the series of evocations we also
attempted various modifications to the conjurations. Invocation
of appropriate God-for ms, such as Horus, prior to beginning
the evocatory process, seemed to make the conjuration of spirits
such as Haures or Andromelius easier. During an evocation of
Glasyglabolas, we preceded the conjurations with an invocation
of chaos, ‘The Unsealing ofthe V ortices’, which was originally
designed for a series of Eris workings. As we did this, a
windstorm blew up a bout the house we were working in, but
the spirit we were attempting to conjure flickered in and out of
the triangle. It seemed to us that the ‘energies’ created by the
Vortices was impeding the spirit’s ability to manifest, so we closed
them, the windstorm dropped away, and the spirit came through
into the triangle. 
 Incidents such as these led us to postulate that the LK spirits
tended to a certain degree of conservatism over the parameters
within which they could he cal led forth. The visions that they
imparted to us concerning the optimum environment for
conjuration definitely belonged to the ‘baroque’ school of magic
- cellars, clouds of incense, lots of paraphernalia etc.

 E voking Yog-Sothoth 
Introduction 
One of the aims of the Esoteric Order of Dagon is to develop effective
magical techniques with which to interact with the Great Old 
Ones. As a member of the Pylon of Yog-Sothoth Lodge, I 
have become increasingly interested in the possibility of ritually 
evoking this entity as a tangible phenomena. The aim of this 
article is to expound a possible methodology by which entities 
such as Yog-Sothoth can be contacted, drawing together research 
in different fields of enquiry, and exploring how they relate to 
the Cthulhu Mythos. 
 I feel that, rather than exploring Lovecraftian themes using 
traditional magical systems such as the Qabalah (though 
obviously, it may provide a useful parallel), the most obvious 
place to look for guidelines is Lovecraft’s fiction itself. From 
this, we find that for example, iTn he Dunwic h Hor, Lorovecrr aft
clearly illustrates that ‘hilltop rites’, associated with stone circles
and strange geophysical phenomena, are a key when 
approaching entities such as Yog-Sothoth. Bringing the Great 
Old Ones into our dimension requires some form of ‘gate’, 
which in mythos tales, is often a wild outdoor site, a stone 
circle, tower, or a similar type of power spot. Lovecraft is also 
careful to point out that such sites have, in historical terms, a 
long history of strange manifestations associated with them. 
Again and again, he places great emphasis on the folklore of 
those who live on the borders of such areas; that ‘locals’ have 
traditions that the educated sceptics appearing in the tales scoff 
at. 
 The theme of specific regions which have a long history of 
strange manifestations is well-documented.ohn K J eel, in Strang e
Creatures From Time & Space, explores several cases involving the 
manifestation of strange beings that appear to be localised to a 
 27 



--------------------------------------- 28

particular region. One example of this is the ‘Moth-man’ 
sightings in West Virginia, which occurred between 1966-1968. 
Another area, perhaps of more interest to UK EOD initiates is 
Ilkley Moor, which has a long, and well-documented history of 
strange phenomena encountered, from ghosts and black dogs 
to UFOs and what modern researchers in the field of Earth 
Mysteries call Earth Lights. 
 The Earth Lights phenomena has arisen largely from the work 
of Paul Deveraux, editor ofT he Le y Hunter and co-founder of 
T he Dr agon Pr.oject His theories are drawn from the fact that the 
Earth produces a r ange of light-f orms by natural processes. 
These ‘unexplained’ light-forms have been interpreted by those 
who encounter them as UFOs or spectral manifestations. The 
occurrence of these phenomena is commonly found to be 
specific to a particular region. The lights often ‘follow’ cars, or 
are reported by observers to behave ‘as though they were being 
guided’ or were intelligent. Deveraux notes that outbreaks of 
EL phenomena are sometimes associated with columns of 
gaseous material, which can be interpreted by observers as 
‘white lad y’ type ghosts . Resear chers in the field of Ear th 
Mysteries hypothesise that the source of such light-forms is the 
tectonic activity of the Earth, where stress along fault lines 
combines with other factors to emit light phenomena in the 
area around the fault line. Deveraux notes that medieval tin 
and copper miners actually looked for the appearance of ‘lights 
from the ground’ when searching out new mine sites. A UFO 
‘flap’ around Ilkley Moor in 1984 appears to validate this theory, 
as it followed an exceptional earthquake in that area, which 
measured at 5.5 on the Richter Scale. Some accounts of 
obser v ers of light f orms (commonl y per cei ved as UFOs) 
suggested that the manifestations followed the patterns of the 
fault lines that run under the region. Devaux’er s book,Ear th
Lights Revelation, explores this kind of activity all over the world, 
and notes the strong connection between UFO sightings and 
geological f aulting. While man y Ufologists reject the Ear th 
Lights theory which in part explains UFO encounters as a purely 
terrestrial phenomena, Earth Mysteries research is continuing 
 28 



--------------------------------------- 29

to document evidence to support and further edify Deveraux’s
ideas. 
 R eading accounts of Ear th Light sightings and their
relationship to specific regions and underground activity is for
me, very reminiscent of Lovecraft’s accounts of the activities
associated with the Great Old Ones. What is perhaps also
significant for the modern magician is that very often, stone
circles and other sacred sites are situated in regions where
geological faulting takes place. Deveraux proposes that the sites
perhaps served to amplify and focus the natural occurrence of
light phenomena. There is a wealth of folklore worldwide which
could be related to the appearance of Earth Lights, from Will
‘o’ the isps to FW aeries, Ghosts, and more recently, UFOs.
From Butterf lies to Bee zle bu b 
I am g reatl y inde bted to the r ecent e xplor ations b y Fra.
Choronzon of the Illuminates of Thanateros for his lucid
exposition of Chaos Mathematics, especially in its relation to
magical entities. In an essayentitled ‘Chaos Invocation’, Fra.
Choronzon writes that: 
 ‘We are all a wa re that inf ormation can be tr ansferred fr om one place to
 another b y modulation ofo-ma electrgnetic standing w aves. I w ould
 l ike you to consider the possibility tha t inf orm ation might also be
 ca pable of stor age or tr ansfer within a tor oidal (i.eped). doughnut-sha
 structure having an electr omagnetic c haracter. ’ 
 Choronzon goes on to suggest that such ordered structures
arise quite naturally out of the Chaos Mathematics which
governs the behaviour of gases and liquids. Probably the best-
known example of this is the great Red Spot which appears in
Jupiter’s atmosphere. He gives the example of a blown smoke-
ring being such a structure, and goes onto point out that it is
conceivable that a non-smoker could equally well project a
ring of gas from their lips, which could be established in the
atmosphere, though its presence, by normal standards, would
be impossible to detect. Choronzon proposes that it is
mathematically possible for such structures, which have (at least
 29 



--------------------------------------- 30

in part) an electromagnetic character to exist within the Earth’s
magnetic field. He also proposes that it is possible to produce
such structures by expending ener g y in the form of neuro-
chemical activity in the nervous system. In short, physiological
gnoses of the sort used by magicians in ritual can produce such
toroid structures. 
 The above has interesting implications for both magicians
and researchers into Earth Mysteries. Over the past year, I have
been conducting a great deal of research into the creation,
usage, and aetiology of evoked entities, including both the
demonic forms of the Goetia and the ‘Elemental Servitors’
created by magicians to perform a specific task. In the latter
case, the process is very much one of creating an ‘information
matrix’; that is, of laying down a set of instructions which define
the na ture, abilities , and functions of the entity . Into this
information matrix is projected energ y, w hich forms the entity
as a whole, which is then able to act, independently of its
creator. A purel y psychological or subjective account of this
process cannot account for the ability of such an entity to
manifest results (in accordance with the creator’s intent) in the
physical world. 
 Following Choronzon’s ideas on Chaos Dynamics, it seems
likely to me that in evoking, and thereby creating, an elemental
servitor, one could be bringing into existence a structure such as
is outlined above. If we can accept (at least in theory) that these
structures are capable of retaining information over time, then
we could be looking at a partial model for a wide range of
phenomena associated with discrete ‘spirits’. In my experience
(and that of colleagues), the more ‘work’ that is given to an
elemental servitor, the more ‘powerful’ it becomes - in terms of
its ability to manipulate probabilities, and eventually take on
an independent character of its own. It is not unknown for
powerful entities to survive the death of their creator. The more
people that ‘create’ such an entity also enhances its survival
and capacity to store information. In these terms, it is easy to
see how a small spirit may, gi ven time and the energy input
(directed through ritual and other techniques for directing
energy) by enough people, could become what we commonly
 30



--------------------------------------- 31

assume to be ‘gods’. 
 To side-step for a moment, I wish to look again at some of
the phenomena associated with UFO and spectral encounters.
One factor that rises time and again to haunt the sceptical
researcher is the commonality of experiences between different
individuals who come into contact with these anomalies.
Historical research into UFO ‘flaps’ shows that there have been
spates of sightings of mysterious spirits, dirigibles, aircraft,
submarines, and of course, f lying saucers, throughout history.
Also, numerous reports from individuals who have been
‘contacted’ by extra- terrestrial entities show similar structural
features in the accounts which have been ‘remembered’ (often
by hypnosis being used as a recall technique). In dealing with
such phenomena, there is obviously a great many factors which
need to be taken into consideration, but I would like to discuss
some of the possible processes which are occurring, with the
aim of weaving them into the discussion later.
 Perhaps I should begin by making a declaration; that I do
not believe that consciousness is a purely internal or subjective
experience; rather, it is an emergent property of our interaction
with the biosphere as a whole. I would assert that consciousness,
and the self-referential awareness of human beings, are not
necessarily one and the same. When individuals encounter
something ‘outside’ their embedded structure of ‘how the world
should be’ - that is, consensus reality, it seems to me that there
is a factor which can be termed ‘the credibility envelope’ which
comes into play, whereby an individual ‘fits’ the experience
into a category that least strains the limitations of consensus
reality. Thus a strange encounter may become a meeting with a
religious entity, a ghost, or creatures from outer space. Conscious
‘belief ’ in the validity of such entities is not necessarily a factor,
since all these phenomena are part of the folklore of ‘the
unknown’ and can be present as ‘memes’ (units of information)
in the subconscious mind of the individual, thanks to our
i nformation-rich culture, with its vast networks of media for
the tr ansmission of inf or mation. In vestig ation into suc h
experiences suggests that people, given some form of unusual
stimulus, such a strange light, will elaborate all kinds of
 31



--------------------------------------- 32

information. Recall techniques such as hypnosis are fallible in
that the psychological tendency to confabulate information (an
unconscious defence mechanism) tends to yield up a great deal
of information which investigators are expecting to hear, which
can again be drawn from information stored in the unconscious
about what is commonly associated with this type of experience.
Another example of this process is the reports of so-called
survivors of ‘satanic child abuse’ which is rich in detail about
bizarre practices but very hazy when it comes to names, dates,
places and so forth. The common themes which arise in such
encounters could well be a product of cultural similarities
between individuals, or even commonalities formed from the
way the human brain structures perception. 
 Paul Deveraux tentatively asserts the proposition that the Earth
Light phenomena is consciousness-sensitive. That is, that the
energy forms are sensitive to the conscious mind of the observer.
Many accounts of Earth Lights talk about the lights following
the observer, plying ‘a tag’with them, or appear to display the
characteristics of being intelligently guided. This brings us back
to magical phenomena and Fra. Choronzon’s ‘Chaos Invocation’
theories. When creating (or evoking a spirit from a grimoire),
we are focusing energy and building an information matrix
which, in turn, allows the energy to create a discrete entity
which behaves within the limits of the inf ormation gi ven -
either the information which defines the characteristics of the
entity, or the information given in the grimoire. This process is
similar (though far more intentional and directed) to the
interaction between a strange phenomena - an Earth Light for
example, - and the individual who encounters it. ‘Traditional’
theories concerning the interaction between human beings and
spirits time and time again recount the idea that spirits ‘like’
interacting with humans because we confer on them a property
of ‘individuality’ that they do not inherently possess. I feel that
there is a grain of truth in this view; that our capacity to organise
and structure information into discrete wholes is a key feature
in coming to grips with this kind of experience. All magical
psychocosms, such as Qabalah, Abra-Melin, etc., give a series
 32 



--------------------------------------- 33

of instructions as to how entities summoned using those 
structures behave. 
 Bearing in mind F ra. Chor onzon’s ideas concer ning the 
toroidal structures which are at least partially electro-magnetic
in character, I would say that it is not beyond the bounds of 
possibility for such a phenomena to be related to occurrences 
such as Earth Light encounters. If such an energy form responds
to (or stimulates) the human capacity to create an information
ma trix, or indeed if our inter action with the ener gy form 
produces as an emergent property a gestalt in accordance with 
either a deliberately projected or an unconsciously formed idea
of what the phenomena is, then we are close to arriving at a 
working methodology for accounting for a wide range of 
occurrences. Drawing on Fra. Choronzon’s work further, if we 
can accept that the energy form, once given a structural definition
by an initial encounter with an individual or group of 
individuals, can retain that definition over time, then it becomes
possible to see how people can, during an encounter ‘flap’ in a
given region, report seeing similar manifestations. In short, the
energy form, once given a structure, can retain this information,
and feed them back to other individuals who subsequently 
interact with them. 
The Neuromancer Effect 
A parallel phenomena which fits this hypothesis is that of 
Channelling . In an essa yentitled Mo rons F rom Inner Space?: A
Critical Look at Channelled Communications I set out a model of one
of the processes possibly involved in the channelling experience:
 “An interesting model for examining inner-plane contacts 
 can be found within William Gibson’s noveNeurl, omancer.
 One of the major characters is an Artificial Intelligence 
 which manipulates a cast of humans to further its own ends. 
 To successfully do this it must establish a rapport with those
 it wishes to manipulate. It does this by generating constructs
 - personalities which it wears like masks, creating them out
 of the memories of the humans it wishes to contact. It 
 33 



--------------------------------------- 34

explains that it needs these masks to establish a point of 
access - an interface - between its own experience and the 
perceptual limits of human beings. Reading this brought 
very much to mind accounts of human- entity contacts. 
Particularly a sentence in Dion Fortune’Tshe Cosmic Doctrine ,
which reads: 
“Wha t we ar e you cannot r ealise and it is a w aste of time to tr y an d
do so but you can imagine (italics mine) us on the astral plane and we
can contact you through your imagination, and though your mental 
picture is not real or actual, the results of it are real and actual.”
Dion Fortune made extensive use of inner-plane contacts 
to synthesise her magical ideas. Alan Richardson, in his 
biography of Dion FortunePriestess, , discusses the various 
historical figures that Fortune claimed to be in contact with. 
The most interesting entity is one “David Carsons”, whom 
according to Fortune, was a young British officer who was 
killed during the first World War. Fortune provided a good 
deal of biog raphical information concerning Carsons, and 
after thorough research, Alan Richardson states that Carsons 
did not exist! Rather, it seems, he was actually, in terms of 
the above model, a construct; a personality generated out 
of Dion Fortune’s experimental ma gic and experiences , 
and hence an interface for accessing inf ormation. If you 
imagine the sum total of your personal memories and 
knowledge as a sphere in space - the unknown - then to 
extend your sphere of information it is as though a window 
must be created, through which the unknown, or raw data, 
can be translated into information that is meaningful in 
terms of perceptual limitations . Inner-plane entities ar e 
how we tend to conceptualise these windows into chaos. 
They appear as independent entities so that we can make 
sense of the incoming data. Their personalities are usually 
concurrent with the r ecipient’s belief system. Hence the 
many forms of the entities, de pending on where you believe 
the seat of wisdom is, be it Egypt, Sirius B, or some draughty 
monaster y in Tibet. Usuall y, it seems , these entities ar e 
 34 



--------------------------------------- 35

 automatically generated as one focuses will and imagination
 to wards any one v ector, but occasionall y entities can be
 generated as an act of will, so that “outposts” can be 
 established within which personal ideas and inner-worlds
 can be e xplor ed and e ventuall y inte g rated into one’ s
 psychocosm. At this point the whole issue of the “reality”
 of the experience breaks down, as these entities are not
 simply “secondary personalities” in the pathological sense,
 but constructs which are emergent properties of our 
 information-processing capacity interacting with that which
 lies beyond it.” 
It strikes me that the above model is also valid for a wide range
of magical phenomena connected with spirit contacts - that the
human tendency to relate to all things as though they are discrete
phenomena ( surely a property of how our brains organise 
information ) enables us to generate ‘masks’ or personae upon
the ener g y for ms w e ar e encountering . Channelled
communications from entities are often a by-product of UFO
experiences as well as psychic encounters. It may well be that
our interaction with energ y forms gives rise to such constructs -
that masks are created and retained by the energy structures,
not from any kind of self-referential intelligence on the part of
the Earth Lights, but from the principle (from Systems Theory)
that some energy forms are attracted towards structures of higher
cohesiveness, such athe infos rmation field genera ted by the
human brain, or possibly the electro-magnetic field generated
by cars, power lines, etc. 
 All of which leads us slowly back to Stone Circles; Lovecraft’s
‘frienzied rites on the hilltops’, and the role that sound plays in
all of this. There is a great deal of magical literature available
exploring the dynamics of sound, particularly different vocal
techniques used to produce an Altered State of 
Consciousness(ASC). One of the key factors seems to be rhythm.
rhythms carry our consciousness along, from heartbeats, to cycles
of breathing, sleeping, night-day and the passage of seasons.
rhythms promote associated body movements and adjustments,
and act as a signal to begin movement without conscious effort,
 35 



--------------------------------------- 36

so that less energy is expended when you begin; for example, it 
has been shown that soldiers can march further, and in better 
form, with less fatigue, w hen accompanied by a marching band. 
The feeling of being “carried” comes from the structure that 
rhythm gives to our time-sense, and the pattern gives a sense 
of continuance. It becomes a motor attitude, and one’s attention 
is freed (if this is desired). rhythms also become “mirrored” by 
our brain activity, and they have powerful physiological effects 
on us. Music Therapists have found that people suffering from 
Aphasia or Huntingdon’s Chorea (both neurological disorders 
which impair speech) can carry a tune, and group singing is a 
common element in therapeutic voice training. Anthropologists 
have done a great deal of work examining the role that music 
plays in hallucinogenic journeys. The presence of music as a 
ritual accessory to hallucinogenic drug use can be observed on 
a wide cross-cultural base. Marlene Dobkin De Rios, in her 
book Hallucino gens: A Cross-Cultur al Pe, sugrspectigests thave t the
ritualised use of music within hallucinogenic journeys helps 
the shaman ‘leading’ such an experience to provide a structure 
with which to point participants towards significant experiences 
within the trip. This is also seen in Voudoun, where specific 
drumming rituals announce the manifestation of particular Lao. 
What is obvious from this is that sound imposes a structure onto 
experience, in particular, with regard to Time-sense. Of which, 
more later. 
 Returning to Fra. Chorozon’s work on Chaos Invocation, he 
notes the use of a ‘pulse of sound’ injected into the space 
occupied by one of the toroidal structures he describes by which 
the inf ormation ma trix is tr ansf erred to the str uctur e. T he 
forceful enunciation of sound, whether it be Enochian Calls, 
Primal Speech, or Barbarous Words of Evoction ofa necessity
produces an ASC, as techniques such as these lead to 
hyperventilation, increased brain activity, tachycardia, etc. It is
well-accepted by magicians and mystics that ‘sound carries 
thought’ and that for advanced practitioners, vocalisation is not 
a necessity for the ritual (or whatever) to be efficacious. What is
important, is the focusing of awareness along a particular vector, 
and the entry into an ASC where the practitioner can focus 
 36 



--------------------------------------- 37

attention intensely towards a single point and project it forth. 
 The relationship between sound and sacred sites is also being 
researched, again by Paul Deveraux. The ‘hill noises’Th ofe 
Dunwic h Hor haro rve been reported occasionally as emanating 
from the locality of sacred sites, differing in variety between 
high- pitc hed buzzing, humming noisesand , ‘thunder claps’
benea th the Earth. In Places of Power, Deveraux notes the 
suggestion that ultrasound is possibly emitted at some megalith 
sites, although more work needs to be done to corroborate this 
elusive finding. Of more interest is what Deveaux calls r ‘The
Physics of Shamanism’. Here, he expounds the relationship 
between psychic (or psi) experiences and the electro-magnetic 
and radiation anomalies associated with sacred sites. Deveraux 
states that for him, one of the characteristics of of a psychic 
experience related to radiation anomalies is that of the sense 
of time-slip, where an individual is dislocated in space-time 
and experiences a vision of past (or future) time. Now altered 
time perceptions are a common feature of magical ritual, 
hallucinogenic use, UFO encounters and spectral manifestations. 
This leads me to suggest that Time is not merely as we usually 
perceive it - a separate force acting upon us, but itself is a 
product of consciousness. In states of gnosis, however they are 
brought on, experiencing the sense that time has stopped, or 
that future, past, and present can be apprehended 
simultaneously, is fairly common. It is also a common feature 
of Type 4 Close Encounters, where people claim to have been 
taken on board alien spacecraft and subjected to tests (or other 
indignities), and also of possession states from which an 
individual may emerge with only a fragmentary memory of 
what took place. From a magical point of view, this ‘peak’ in an 
ASC is the most fortuitous moment at which to project energy 
forth to realise one’s will. Following the theory of Earth Lights, 
together with Fra. Choronzon’s toroidal structures that assume 
their o wn inf orma tion str uctur e, it ma y well be tha t such 
phenomena bring about ‘timeslip’ experiences and, as to the 
source of the images that come in, well we could speculate far 
and wide. That we may be much more sensitive to a wider 
 37 



--------------------------------------- 38

range of fluctuations in the Earth’s magnetic field is becoming
more and more acceptable to science. The American researcher,
Michael Persinger, has put forwards the view that there is a link
between some forms of psi activity and fluctuations in the Earth’s
magnetic field. It has been also suggested that part of the
Hippocampus region of the brain senses, and distributes to other
brain areas, information about electromagnetic fields. Persinger’s
work appears to validate two points; firstly, that the brain can
generate electro-magnetic energy, and secondly, that external
sources of electro-magnetic energy can affect brain function,
giving rise to a wide variety of ‘experienced’ phenomena. If we
can accept this (and there is a growing body of research that
bears this out), then sud denl y Fra. Choronzon’s ideas a bout
electro-magnetic structures which have the capacity to order
themselves by, and retain information over time, don’t sound
so far-fetched, do they? 
 Coming back to the Cthulhu Mythos, it seems then that
Lovecraft was on the right track with his themes of weird hill-
regions, stone circles, barbarous words of powand er, ‘frienzied
rites’. The work of Paul Deveraux and other researchers points
to the conclusion that some sacred sites at least, are power
spots which predisposed the users towards obtaining an ASC
whereby they could interact with energ y forms of an electro-
magnetic nature, doubtless aided by Earth Light manifestations
and hallucinogenic substances. Earth Mysteries researcher Paul
Bennett has noted that in Britain, as in many other places, a
variety of plants which have hallucinogenic properties can be
found growing near to sacred sites. The magical dynamics of
sound are also a factor, in terms of both the psycho-physical
effects upon the participants, and the effect upon external energy
sources. 
 As to the entity Yog-Sothoth, who’s appearance in the Mythos
triggered this lengthy chain of synthesis; some modern
magicians, notably those drawing heavily upon the ideas of
Kenneth Grant, have drawn a parallel between Yog-Sothoth
and the demon Choronzon, evoked by Aleister Crowley and
Victor Neub urg in the Gobi Deser t. Ag ain, The Dunwic h
Horror provides us with a key passage:
 38



--------------------------------------- 39

 “T he Old Ones w ere, the Old Ones ar e , and the Old Ones shall be ,
 not in the spaces w e know, but betw een them. T hey walk ser ene and
 primal, undimensioned, and to us unseen. Yog Sothoth kno ws the g ate.
 Yog-Sothoth is the g ate. Yog-Sothoth is the k ey and guar dian of the g ate.
 Past, present, future, all arone in e g-Sothoth.Yo He kno w s where the
 Old Ones broke through of old, and where they shall break through
 ag ain. ...T h ey walk unseen and f oul in lonel y places w here the Words
 ha ve been spok en and the Rites ho wled thr ough at their Seasons . T he
 wind gibbers with their voices and the earth mutters with their
 consciousness .” 
 This passage brings to mind the ‘timeslip’ phenomena
discussed above. What is equally, if not more interesting in the
light (no pun intended) of the present discussion is that in other
Mythos tales , Yog-Sothoth is described as a conglomer ate of
iridescent g lobes - in other w ords, a light form phenomena!
The entity is also associated with strange atmospheric effects
such as freak winds and stor ms (Lovecraft is known to have
carefully related some of his fictional events with floods,
earthquakes, and other such occurrence)s. To me, this stresses
further the validity of Lovecraft’s dream-inspired fiction as a
valid source of magical ideas. 
 The guidelines to eoking Yv og-Sothoth appear, at least as far
as T he Dunwic h Horsets them fror orth, to be quite c lear and
operationally valid. Investigation of the entity has (in my view)
suffered from the negative connotations of association with
Choronzon as an entity of dispersal, or ‘negative’ chaos. The
emerging science of Chaos Dynamics can perhaps afford us a
more positive viewpoint, and the link between Mythos entities
and the Mandelbrot Set has already been noted by EOD
initiates. From the foregoing, I w ould suggest that Yog-Sothoth
is quite possible a kind of ‘guide’ entity that appears in many
cultures as the ‘guardian’ of the underworld entered through
ASCs, though one which is capable of manifesting as a series,
perhaps, of electro- magnetic phenomena. The entity which
coheres in the form we understand as Yog-Sothoth is a ‘window’
into the darkness of the unknown, and perhaps by creating
 39 



--------------------------------------- 40

interfaces, or personae through which we may glean
information, we can attain further insights into the w ay we
interact with our universe. Having theorised thus far, what only
remains is to go forth and evoke! 
 Postscript: “From the ancient hills I come”
This essay is largely the result of reading other people’s research
and shaping it together with my own ideas. One event last year
however, served to elevate the field of Earth Mysteries from a
minor interest to a subject that I am increasingly drawn to.
 On the night in question, I was with my boyfriend (also a
magician), and he returned from the toilet and informed me
that there was an ‘entity’ lurking in the stairwell that leads to
my flat. This was unusual, but not sufficiently unusual to cause
undue concern and so picking up my thunderbolt, I went out
to see what was what. In the stairwell, we both agreed on seeing
a black, amorphous shape. Since my friend had first noticed
this, I asked him if he would be prepared to try and ‘open his
mind’ to it, so that I could question it, using him as an interface,
which was one of his particular talents, and also a fairly accepted
procedure for questioning strange entities. The entity declared
“I have come from the ancient hills”. It also stated that it had
been ‘awaened’k only recently, due to activity around a sacred
site. It said that it had come to give me ‘power’ with which I
could do something, but was reticent about the exact nature of
this. When I asked what it would if I rejected this, it said that it
would “retur n, screaming, to the hills”. When I asked it to
identify itself, it gave the name of ‘Azathoth’ - which could well
have sprung from the mind of my friend, though he had no
particular knowledge of the Cthulhu Mythos entities. At the
time, I found it difficult to credit that such a powerful entity
would be hanging politely about in the stairwell, waiting to be
noticed. Being unable to obtain a direct answer to my
questioning, I told it to go forth, which it apparently did. I later
had to perform an intensive banishing ritual upon my friend,
who was suffering from symptoms such as feeling cold, a tight
pressure on the chest, and personality displacement, and motor
 40



--------------------------------------- 41

spasms. Symptoms such as these have been described by
Michael Persinger as possible side-effects of encounters with
Earth Light phenomena. 
 Unbeknown to me at the time, (which was later discovered
when I related this tale) two friends of mine who were members
of the West Yokshirr e Earth Mysteries Group had experienced
a strange encounter at the then newly-uncovered Backstone
Stone Circle. Their experience included seeing Earth Lights,
small dwarf-like shades, and lines of energy around the stone
circle that they spent a night sitting in. It seems strange, on
reflection, that the appearance of the entity claiming to originate
from a newly-disturbed site seems to relate to their experience.
What this experience did do, was to lead me to making a more
intensive study of Earth Mysteries and Magic.
