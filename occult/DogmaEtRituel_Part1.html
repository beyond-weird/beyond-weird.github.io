 INTRODUCTION 
BEHIND the veil of all the hieratic and mystical allegories of ancient doctrines, 
behind the darkness and strange ordeals of all initiations, under the seal of all 
sacred writings, in the ruins of Nineveh or Thebes, on the crumbling stones of old 
temples and on the blackened visage of the Assyrian or Egyptian sphinx, in the 
monstrous or marvellous paintings which interpret to the faithful of India the 
inspired pages of the Vedas, in the cryptic emblems of our old books on alchemy, 
in the ceremonies practised at reception by all secret societies, there are found 
indications of a doctrine which is everywhere the same and everywhere carefully 
concealed. Occult philosophy seems to have been the nurse or god-mother of all 
intellectual forces, the key of all divine obscurities and the absolute queen of soci-
ety in those ages – when it was reserved exclusively for the education of priests 
and of kings. It reigned in Persia with the Magi, who perished in the end, as perish 
all masters of the world, because they abused their power; it endowed India with 
the most wonderful traditions and with an incredible wealth of poesy, grace and 
terror in its emblems; it civilized Greece to the music of the lyre of Orpheus; it 
concealed the principles of all sciences, all progress of the human mind, in the 
daring calculations of Pythagoras; fable abounded in its miracles, and history, 
attempting to estimate this unknown power, became confused with fable; it 
undermined or consolidated empires by its oracles, caused tyrants to tremble on 
their thrones and governed all minds, either by curiosity or by fear. For this sci- 
ence, said the crowd, there is nothing impossible, it commands the elements, 
knows the language of the stars and directs the planetary courses; when it speaks, 
the moon falls blood-red from heaven; the dead rise in their graves and mutter 
ominous words, as the night wind blows thrugh their skulls. Mistro ess of love or of
hate, occult science can dispense paradise or hell at its pleasure to human hearts; 
it disposes of all forms and confers beauty or ugliness; with the wand of Circe it 
changes men into brutes and animals alternately into men; it disposes even of life 
and death, can confer wealth on its adepts by the transmutation of metals and 
immortality by its quintessence or elixir, compounded of gold and light. 
 Such was Magic from Zoroaster to Manes, from Orpheus to Apollonius of 
Tyana, when positive Christianity, victorious at length over the brilliant dreams 
and titanic aspirations of the Alexandrian school, dared to launch its anathemas 
publicly against this philosophy, and thus forced it to become more occult and 
mysterious than ever. Moreover, strange and alarming rumours began to circulate 
concerning initiates or adepts; they were surrounded every where by an ominous 
influence, and they destroyed or distracted those who allowed themselves to be 
beguiled by their honeyed eloquence or by the sorcery of their learning. The 
women whom they loved became Stryges and their children vanished at nocturnal 
meetings, while men whispered shudderingly and in secret of bloodstained orgies

and abominable banquets. Bones had been found in the crypts of ancient temples,
shrieks had been heard in the night, harvests withered and herds sickened when
the magician passed by. Diseases which defied medical skill appeared at times in
the world, and always, it was said, beneath the envenomed glance of the adepts.
At length a universal cry of execration went up against Magic, the mere name
became a crime and the common hatred was formulated in this sentence: “Magi-
cians to the flames!” – as it was shouted some centuries earlier: “To the lions with
the Christians!” Now the multitude never conspires except against real powers; it
does not know what is true, but it has the instinct of what is strong. It remained
for the eighteenth century to deride both Christians and Magic, while infatuated
with the disquisitions of Rousseau and the illusions of Cagliostro.
 Science, notwithstanding, is at the basis of Magic, as at the root of Christianity
there is love, and in the Gospel symbols we find the Word Incarnate adored in His
cradle by Three Magi, led thither by a star – the triad and the sign of the micro-
cosm – and receiving their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh, a second myste-
rious triplicity, under which emblem the highest secrets of the Kabalah are
allegorically contained. Christianity owes therefore no hatred to Magic, but
human ignorance has ever stood in fear of the unknown. The science was driven
into hiding to escape the impassioned assaults of blind desire: it clothed itself with
new hieroglyphics, falsified its intentions, denied its hopes. Then it was that the
jargon of alchemy was created, an impenetrable illusion for the vulgar in their
greed of gold, a living language only for the true disciple of Hermes.
 Extraordinary fact! Among the sacred r ecords of the Christians there are two
texts which the infallible Church makes no claim to understand and has never
attempted to expound: these are the Prophecy of Ezekiel and the Apocalypse, two
Kabalistic Keys reserved assuredly in heaven for the commentaries of Magian
Kings, books sealed as with seven seals for faithful believers, yet perfectly plain to
an initiated infidel of the occult sciences. There is also another work, but,
although it is popular in a sense and may be found everywhere, this is of all most
occult and unknown, because it is the key of the rest. It is in public evidence with-
out being known to the public; no one suspects its existence and no one dreams of
seeking it where it actually is. This book, which may be older than that of Enoch,
actually has never been translated, but is still preserved unmutilated in primeval
characters, on detached leaves, like the tablets of the ancients. The fact has
eluded notice, though a distinguished scholar has revealed, not indeed its secret,
but its antiquity and singular preservatio n. Another scholar, but of a mind more
fantastic than judicious, passed years in the study of this masterpiece, and has
merely suspected its plenary importance. It is, in truth, a monumental and
extraordinary work, strong and simple as the architecture of the pyramids, and
consequently enduring like those – a book which is the summary of all sciences,
which can resolve all problems by its infinite combinations, which speaks by

 INTRODUCTION 3
evoking thought, is the inspirer and moderator of all possible conceptions, and the 
masterpiece perhaps of the human mind. It is to be counted unquestionably 
among the very great gifts bequeathed to us by antiquity; it is a universal key, the 
name of which has been explained and comprehended only by the learned Will- 
iam Postel; it is a unique test, whereof the initial characters alone plunged into 
ecstasy the devout spirit of Saint-Martin, and might have restored reason to the 
sublime and unfortunate Swedenborg. We shall recur to this book later on, for its 
mathematical and precise explanation will be the complement and crown of our 
conscientious undertaking. 
 The original alliance between Christianity and the Science of the Magi, once 
demonstrated fully, will be a discovery of no second-rate importance, and we do 
not doubt that the serious study of Magic and the Kabalah will lead earnest minds 
to a reconciliation of science and dogma, of reason and faith, heretofore regarded 
as impossible. 
 We have said that the Church, whose special office is the custody of the Keys, 
does not pretend to possess those of the Apocalypse or of Ezekiel. In the opinion of 
Christians the scientific and magical Clavi cles of Solomon are lost, which notwith- 
standing, it is certain that, in the domain of intelligence, ruled by the Word noth- 
ing that has been written can perish. Whatsoever men cease to understand exists 
for them no longer, at least in the order of the Word, and it passes then into the 
domain of enigma and mystery. Furthermore, the antipathy and even open war of 
the Official Church against all that belongs to the realm of Magic, which is a kind 
of personal and emancipated priesthood, is allied with necessary and even with 
inherent causes in the social and hierarchic constitution of Christian sacerdotal- 
ism. The Church ignores Magic – for she must either ignore it or perish, as we 
shall prove later on; yet she does not recognize the less that her mysterious 
Founder was saluted in His cradle by Three Magi – that is to say, by the hieratic 
ambassadors of the three parts of the known world and the three analogical 
worlds of occult philosophy. In the School of Alexandria, Magic and Christianity 
almost joined hands under the auspices of Ammonius Saccas and of Plato; the 
doctrine of Hermes is found almost in its entirety in the writings attributed to 
Dionysius the Areopagite; Synesius outlined the plan of a treatise on dreams, 
which was annotated subsequently by Cardan, and composed hymns that might 
have served for the liturgy of the Church of Swedenborg, could a church of the 
illuminated possess a liturgy. With this period of fiery abstractions and impas- 
sioned warfare of words there must be connected also the philosophic reign of 
Julian, called the Apostate because in his youth he made unwilling profession of 
Christianity. Everyone is aware that Julian had the misfortune to be a hero out of 
season of Plutarch, and that he was, if one may say so, the Don Quixote of roman 
Chivalry; but what most people do not know is that he was one of the illuminated 
and an initiate of the first order: that he believed in the unity of God and in the

universal doctrine of the Trinity; that, in a word, he regretted nothing of the old
world but its magnificent symbols and its too gracious images. Julian was not a
pagan; he was a Gnostic allured by the allegories of Greek polytheism, who had
the misfortune to find the name of Jesus Christ less sonorous than that of
Orpheus. The Emperor paid in his person for the academical tastes of the philoso-
pher and rhetorician, and after affording himself the spectacle and satisfaction of
expiring like Epaminondas with the periods of Cato, he had in public opinion, by
this time fully Christianized , but anathemas for his funeral oration and a scornful
epithet for his ultimate memorial.
 Let us pass over the petty minds and small matters of the Bas-Empire, and
proceed to the Middle Ages . . . . Stay, take this book! Glance at the seventh page,
then seat yourself on the mantle which I am spreading, and let each of us cover
our eyes with one of its corners . . . . Your head swims, does it not, and the earth
seems to fly beneath your feet? Hold tightly, and do not look right or left . . . .
The vertigo ceases: we are here. Stand up and open your eyes, but take care
before all things to make no Christian sign and to pronounce no Christian words.
We are in a landscape of Salvator Rosa, a troubled wilderness which seems resting
after a storm. There is no moon in the sky, but you can distinguish little stars
gleaming in the brushwood, and may hear about you the slow flight of great
birds, which seem to whisper strange oracles as they pass. Let us approach
silently that crossroad among the rocks. A harsh, funereal trumpet winds sud-
denly, and black torches flare up on every side. A tumultuous throng is surging
round a vacant throne: all watch and wait. Suddenly they cast themselves on the
ground. A goat-headed prince bounds forward among them; he ascends the
throne, turns, and assuming a stooping posture, presents to the assembly a human
face, which everyone comes forward to salute and to kiss, their black taper in
their hands. With a hoarse laugh he recovers an upright position, and then dis-
tributes gold, secret instructions, occult medicines and poisons to his faithful
bondsmen. Meanwhile, fires are lighted of fern and alder, piled up with human
bones and the fat of executed criminals. Druidesses, crowned with wild parsley
and vervain, immolate unbaptized children with golden knives and prepare horri-
ble love-feasts. Tables are spread, masked men seat themselves by half-nude
females, and a Bacchanalian orgy begins; there is nothing wanting but salt, the
symbol of wisdom and immortality. Wine flows in streams, leaving stains like
blood; obscene advances and abandoned caresses begin. A little while, and the
whole assembly is beside itself with drink and wantonness, with crimes and sing-
ing. They rise, a disordered throng, and form infernal dances . . . . Then come all
legendary monsters, all phantoms of nightmare; enormous toads play inverted
flutes and thump with paws on flanks; limping scarabaei mingle in the dance;
crabs play the castanets; crocodiles beat time on their scales; elephants and mam-
moths appear habited like Cupids and foot it in the ring: finally, the giddy circles

break up and scatter on all sides . . . . Every yelling dancer drags away a dishev- 
elled female . . . . Lamps and candles formed of human fat go out smoking in the 
darkness . . . . Cries are heard here and there, mingled with peals of laughter, 
blasphemies and rattlings in the throat. Come, rouse yourself: do not make the 
sign of the cross! See, I have brought you home. You are in your bed, not a little 
worn out, possibly a trifle shattered, by your night's journey and its orgy; but you 
have beheld that of which everyone talks without knowledge; you have been initi- 
ated into secrets no less terrible than the grotto of Triphonius; you have been 
present at the Sabbath. It remains for you now to preserve your wits, to have a 
wholesome dread of the law, and to keep at a respectful distance from the Church 
and her faggots. 
 Would you care, as a change, to behold something less fantastic, more real and 
also more truly terrible? You shall assist at the execution of Jacques de Molay and 
his accomplices or his brethren in martyrdom . . . . Be not misled, however; con- 
fuse not the guilty and the innocent! Did the Templars really adore Baphomet? 
Did they offer a shameful salutation to the buttocks of the goat of Mendes? What 
was actually this secret and potent association which imperilled Church and 
State, and was thus destroyed unheard? Judge nothing lightly; they are guilty of a 
great crime; they have exposed to profane eyes the sanctuary of antique initiation. 
They have gathered again and have shared the fruits of the tree of knowledge, so 
that they might become masters of the world. The judgement pronounced against 
them is higher and far older than the tribunal of pope or king: “On the day that 
thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die,” said God Himself, as we read in the 
Book of Genesis. 
 What then is taking place in the world, and why do priests and potentates 
tremble? What secret power threatens tiar as and crowns? A few bedlamites are 
roaming from land to land, concealing, as they say, the Philosophical Stone under 
their ragged vesture. They can change earth into gold, and they are without food 
or lodging! Their brows are encircled by an aureole of glory and by a shadow of 
ignominy! One has discovered the universal science and goes vainly seeking death 
to escape the agonies of his triumph: he is the Majorcan Raymond Lully. Another 
heals imaginary diseases by fantastic remedies, belying beforehand that proverb 
which enforces the futility of a cautery on a wooden leg: he is the marvellous 
Paracelsus, always drunk and always lucid, like the heroes of Rabelais. Here is 
William Postel writing naivel y to the fathers of the Council of Trent, proclaiming 
that he has discovered the absolute doctrine, hidden from the foundation of the 
world, and is longing to share it with them. The Council heeds not the maniac, 
does not vouchsafe to condemn him, but proceeds to examine the grave questions 
of efficacious grace and sufficing grace. He whom we behold perishing poor and 
abandoned is Cornelius Agrippa, less of a magician than any, though the vulgar 
persist in regarding him as a more potent sorcerer than all because he was some-

times a cynic and mystifier. What secret do these men bear with them to their
tomb? Why are they wondered at without being understood? Why are they con-
demned unheard? Why are they initiates of those terrific secret sciences of which
the Church and society are afraid? Why ar e they acquainted with things of which
others know nothing? Why do they conceal what all men burn to know? Why are
they invested with a dread and unknown power? The occult sciences! Magic!
These words will reveal all and give food for further thought! De omni re scribili
et quibusdum aliis. 
 But what, as a fact, was this Magic? What was the power of these men who
were at once so proud and so persecuted? If they were really strong, why did they
not overcome their enemies? But if they were impotent and foolish, why did peo-
ple honour them by fearing them? Does Magic exist? Is there an occult knowledge
which is in truth a power and works wonders comparable to the miracles of
authorized religions? To these two palmary questions we make answer by an
affirmation and a book. The book shall justify the affirmation, and the affirma-
tion is this: There was and there still is a potent and real Magic; all that is said of
it in legend is true after a certain manner, yet – contrary to the common course of
popular exaggeration – it falls below the truth. There is indeed a formidable
secret, the revelation of which has once already transformed the world, as testified
in Egyptian religious tradition, summarized symbolically by Moses at the begin-
ning of Genesis. This secret constitutes the fatal Science of Good and Evil, and the
consequence of its revelation is death. Moses depicts it under the figure of a Tree
which stands in the midst of the Terrestrial Paradise, is in proximity to the Tree of
Life and is joined at the root thereto. At the foot of this tree is the source of the
four mysterious rivers; it is guarded by the sword of fire and by the four symboli-
cal forms of the Biblical sphinx, the Cherubim of Ezekiel . . . . Here I must pause,
and I fear that already I have said too much. I testify in fine that there is one sole,
universal and imperishable dogma, strong as supreme reason; simple, like all that
is great; intelligible, like all that is universally and absolutely true; and this dogma
is the parent of all others. There is also a science which confers on man powers
apparently superhuman. They are enumerated thus in a Hebrew manuscript of
the sixteenth century: 
 “Hereinafter follow the powers and privileges of him who holds in his
 right hand the Clavicles of Solomon, and in his left the Branch of the Blos-
 soming Almond. ' ALEPH . – He beholds God face to face, without dying.
 and converses familiarly with the seven genii who command the entire celes-
 tial army. h BETH . – He is above all griefs and all fears. g GHIMEL . – He
 reigns with all heaven and is served by all hell. o DALETH . – He rules his
 own health and life and can influence equally those of others. x HE. – He
 can neither be surprised by misfortune nor overwhelmed by disasters, nor

 can he be conquered by his enemies. nVAU. – He knows the reason of the 
 past, present and future. z ZAIN. – He possesses the secrt of the re esurrection 
 of the dead and the key of immortality. 
 Such are the seven chief privileges, and those which rank next are these: 
 kCHETH. – To find the Philosophical Stone. tTETH. – To possess the 
 Universal Medicine. v IOD. – To know the laws of perpetual motion and to 
 prove the quadrature of the circle. [ CAPH . – To change into gold not only 
 all metals but also the earth itself, and even the refuse of the earth. 
 sLAMED. – To subdue the most ferocious animals and have power to pro- 
 nounce those words which paralyse and charm serpents. a MEM. – To have 
 the ARS NOTORIA which gives the Universal Science. i NUN. – To speak 
 learnedly on all subjects, without preparation and without study. 
 These, finally, are the seven least powers of the Magus: 
 ySAMECH. – To know at a glance the deep things of the souls of men and 
 the mysteries of the hearts of women. r AYIN. – To force Nature to make him 
 free at his pleasure. q PE . – To foresee all futureevents which do not depend 
 on a superior free will, or on an undiscernible cause. , TSADE . – To give at 
 once and to all the most efficacious consolations and the most wholesome 
 counsels. f KOPH . – To triumph over adversities. wRESH . – To conquer love 
 and hate. c SHIN . – To have the secret of wealth, to bealways its master and 
 never its slave. To enjoy even poverty and never become abject or miserable. 
 mTAU. – Let us add to these three septenaries that the wise man rules the 
 elements, stills tempests, cures the diseased by his touch and raises the 
 dead! 
 But certain things have been sealed by Solomon with his triple seal. It is 
 enough that the initiates know; as for others, whether they deride, doubt or 
 believe, whether they threaten or fear, what matters it to science or to us?” 
 Such actually are the issues of occult philosophy, and we are in a position to 
meet the charge of insanity or the suspicion of imposture when we affirm that 
these privileges are real. To demonstrate this is the sole end of our work on occult 
philosophy. The Philosophical Stone, the Universal Medicine, the transmutation 
of metals, the quadrature of the circle and the secret of perpetual motion are nei- 
ther mystifications of science nor dreams of delusion. They are terms which must 
be understood in their proper sense; they formulate the varied applications of one 
and the same secret, the several aspects of a single operation, which is defined in a 
more comprehensive manner under the name of the Great Work. Furthermore, 
there exists in Nature a force which is immeasurably more powerful than steam, 
and a single man, who is able to adapt and direct it, might change thereby the 
face of the whole world. This force was known to the ancients; it consists in a Uni- 
versal Agent having equilibrium for its supreme law, while its direction is con-

8 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic 
cerned immediately with the Great Arcanum of Transcendental Magic. By the
direction of this agent it is possible to modify the very order of the seasons; to pro-
duce at night the phenomena of day; to correspond instantaneously between one
extremity of the earth and the other; to see, like Apollonius, what is taking place
on the other side of the world; to heal or injure at a distance; to give speech a uni-
versal success and reverberation. This agent, which barely manifests under the
uncertain methods of Mesmer's followers, is precisely that which the adepts of the
Middle Ages denominated the First Matter of the Great Work. The Gnostics repre-
sented it as the fiery body of the Holy Spirit; it was the object of adoration in the
Secret Rites of the Sabbath and the Temple, under the hieroglyphic figure of Bap-
homet or the Androgyne of Mendes. All this will be proved. 
 Here then are the secrets o occult philosophyf , and such is Magic in history. Let
us glance at it now as it appears in its books and its acts, in its Initiations and its
Rites. The key of all magical allegories is found in the tablets which we have men-
tioned, and these tablets we regard as the work of Hermes. About this book,
which may be called the keystone of the whole edifice of occult science, are
grouped innumerable legends that are either its partial translation or its commen-
tary reproduced perpetually, under a thousand varied forms. Sometimes the inge-
nious fables combine harmoniously into a great epic which characterizes an
epoch, though how or why is not clear to the uninitiated. T hus, the fabulous his-
tory of the Golden Fleece resumes and also veils the Hermetic and magical doc-
trines of Orpheus; and if we recur only to the mysterious poetry of Greece, it is
because the sanctuaries of Egypt and India to some extent dismay us by their
resources, leaving our choice embarrassed in the midst of such abundant wealth.
We are eager, moreover, to reach the Thebaid at once, that dread synthesis of all
doctrine, past, present and future; that – so to speak – infinite fable, which
reaches, like the Deity of Orpheus, to either end of the cycle of human life.
Extraordinary fact! The seven gates of Th ebes, attacked and defended by seven
chiefs who have sworn upon the blood of victims, possess the same significance as
the seven seals of the Sacred Book interpreted by seven genii and assailed by a
monster with seven heads, after being opened by a Lamb which liveth and was
dead, in the allegorical work of St. John. The mysterious origin of Oedipus, found
hanging on the tree of Cithaeron like a bleeding fruit, recalls the symbols of Moses
and the narratives of Genesis. He makes war upon his father, whom he slays with-
out knowing – tremendous prophecy of the blind emancipation of reason apart
from science. Thereafter he meets with the sphinx, that symbol of symbols, the
eternal enigma of the vulgar, the granite pedestal of the sciences of the sages, the
voracious and silent monster whose unchanging form expresses the one dogma of
the Great Universal Mystery. How is the tetrad changed into the duad and
explained by the triad? In more common but more emblematic terms, what is that
animal which in the morning has four feet, two at noon, and three in the evening?



--------------------------------------- 13

 INTRODUCTION 9
Philosophically speaking, how does the doctrine of elementary forces produce the 
dualism of Zoroaster, while it is summarized by the triad of Pythagoras and 
Plato? What is the ultimate reason of allegories and numbers, the final message of 
all symbolisms? Oedipus replies with a simple and terrible word which destroys 
the sphinx and makes the diviner King of Thebes: the answer to the enigma is 
MAN! . . . Unfortunate! He has seen too much, and yet through a clouded glass. A 
little while and he will expiate his ominous and imperfect clairvoyance by a vol- 
untary blindness, and then vanish in the midst of a storm, like all civilizations 
which – each in its own day – shall divine an answer to the riddle of the sphinx 
without grasping its whole import and mystery. Everything is symbolical and 
transcendental in this titanic epic of human destinies. The two antagonistic broth- 
ers formulate the second part of the Grand Mystery, completed divinely by the 
sacrifice of Antigone. There follows the last war; the brethren slay one another; 
Capaneus is destroyed by the lightning which he defies; Amphiaraus is swallowed 
by the earth; and all these are so many allegories which, by their truth and their 
grandeur, astonish those who can penetrate their triple hieratic sense. Aeschylus, 
annotated by Ballanche, gives only a weak notion concerning them, whatever the 
primeval sublimities of the Greek poet or the ingenuities of the French critic. 
 The secret book of antique initiation was not unknown to Homer, who outlines 
its plan and chief figures on the shield of Achilles, with minute precision. But the 
gracious Homeric fictions replaced too soon in popular memory the simple and 
abstract truths of prime val revelation. Humanity cl ung to the form and allowed 
the idea to be forgotten; signs lost power in their multiplication; Magic became 
corrupted also at this period, and degenerated with the sorcerers of Thessaly into 
the most profane enchantments. The crime of Oedipus brought forth its deadly 
fruits, and the science of good and evil erected evil into a sacrilegious divinity. 
Men, weary of the light, took refuge in the shadow of bodily substance; the dream 
of that void which is filled by God seemed in their eyes to be greater than God 
Himself, and thus hell was created. 
 When, in the course of this work, we make use of the consecrated terms God, 
Heaven and Hell, let it be understood, once and for all, that our meaning is as far 
removed from that which the profane attach to them as initiation is remote from 
vulgar thought. God, for us, is the AZOT of the sages, the efficient and final prin- 
ciple of the Great Work. 
 Returning to the fable of Oedipus, the crime of the King of Thebes was that he 
failed to understand the sphinx; that he destroyed the scourge of Thebes without 
being pure enough to complete the expation in the name of his people. Thei 
plague, in consequence, avenged speedily the death of the monster, and the King 
of Thebes, forced to abdicate, sacrificed himself to the terrible manes of the 
sphinx, more alive and voracious than ever when it had passed from the domain 
of form into that of idea. Oedipus divined what was man and he put out his own

eyes because he did not see what was God. He divulged half of the Great 
Arcanum, and, to save his people, it was necessary for him to bear the remaining 
half of the terrible secret into exile and the grave. 
 After the colossal fable of Oedipus we find the gracious poem of Psyche, which 
was certainly not invented by Apuleius. The Great Magical Arcanum reappears 
here under the figure of a mysterious union between a god and a weak mortal, 
abandoned alone and naked on a rock. Psyche must remain in ignorance of the 
secret of her ideal royalty, and if she behold her husband she must lose him. Here 
Apuleius commentates and interprets Moses; but did not the Elohim of Israel and 
the gods of Apuleius both issue from the sanctuaries of Memphis and Thebes? 
Psyche is the sister of Eve, or rather she is Eve spiritualized. Both desire to know 
and lose innocence for the honour of the ordeal. Both deserve to go down into hell, 
one to bring back the antique box of Pandora, the other to find and to crush the 
head of the old serpent, who is the symbol of t ime and o f evil Both ar. e guilty of
the crime which must be expiated by the Prometheus of ancient days and the 
Lucifer of the Christian le gend, the one delivered by Hercules and the other over- 
come by the Saviour. The Great Magical Secret is therefore the lamp and dagger 
of Psyche, the apple of Eve, the sacred fire of Prometheus, the burning sceptre of 
Lucifer, but it is also the Holy Cross of the Redeemer. To be acquainted with it 
sufficiently for its abuse or divulgation is to deserve all sufferings; to know as one 
should alone know it, namely,to make use of and co nceal it, is to be master of the
Absolute. 
 A single word comprehends all things, and this word consists of four letters: it 
is the Tetragram of the Hebrews, the AZOT of the alchemists, the Thot of the 
Bohemians, or the Taro of the Kabalists. This word, expressed after so many man- 
ners, means God for the profane, man for the philosophers, and imparts to the 
adepts the final term of human sciences and the key of divine power; but he only 
can use it who understands the necessity of never revealing it. Had Oedipus, 
instead of killing the sphinx, overcome it, harnessed it to his chariot and thus 
entered Thebes, he would have been king without incest, without misfortunes and 
without exile. Had Psyche, by meekness and affection, persuaded Love to reveal 
himself, she would never have lost Love. Now, Love is one of the mythological 
images of the Great Secret and the Great Agent, because it postulates at once an 
action and a passion, a void and a plenitude, a shaft and a wound. The initiates 
will understand me, and on account of the profane I must not speak more clearly. 
 After the marvellous Golden Ass of Apuleius, we find no more magical epics. 
Science, conquered in Alexandria by the fanaticism of the murderers of Hypatia, 
became Christian, or rather concealed itself under Christian veils with Ammonius, 
Synesius and the pseudonymous author of the books of Dionysius the Areopagite. 
In such times it was necessary to exonerate miracles under the pretence of super- 
stition and science by an unintelligible language. Hieroglyphic writing was

revived; pantacles and characters were invented to summarize an entire doctrine 
by a sign, a whole sequence of tendencies and revelations in a word. What was the 
end of the aspirants to knowledge? They sought the secret of the Great Work, the 
Philosophical Stone, the perpetual motion, the quadrature of the circle, the Uni- 
versal Medicine – formulae which often saved them from persecution and hatred 
by causing them to be taxed with madness, but all signifying one of the phases of 
the Great Magical Secret, as we shall show later on. This absence of epics contin- 
ues till our Romance of the Rose; but the rose-symbol, which expresses also the 
mysterious and magical sense of Dante's poem, is borrowed from the transcendent 
Kabalah, and it is time th at we should have recourse to this vast and hidden 
source of universal philosophy. 
 The Bible, with all its allegories, gives expression to the religious knowledge of 
the Hebrews only in an incomplete and veiled manner. The book which we have 
mentioned, the hieratic characters of which we shall explain subsequently, that 
book which William Postel names the Genesis of Enoch, existed certainly before 
Moses and the prophets, whose doctrine, fundamentally identical with that of the 
ancient Egyptians, had also its exotericism and its veils. When Moses spoke to the 
people, says the sacred book allegorically, he placed a veil over his face, and he 
removed it when communing with God: this accounts for the alleged Biblical 
absurdities which so exercised the satirical powers of Voltaire. The books were 
written only as memorials of tradition and in symbols that were unintelligible to 
the profane. The Pentateuch and the poems of the prophets were, moreover, ele- 
mentary works, alike in doctrine, ethics and liturgy; the true secret and tradi- 
tional philosophy was not committed to writing until a later period and under 
veils even less transparent. Thus arose a second and unknown Bible, or rather one 
which was not comprehended by Christians, a storehouse, so they say, of mon- 
strous absurdities – for in this case believers, involved by the same ignorance, 
speak the language of sceptics – but a monument, as we affirm, which comprises 
all that philosophical and religious genius has ever accomplished or imagined in 
the sublime order, a treasure encompassed by thorns, a diamond concealed in a 
rude and opaque stone: our readers will have guessed already that we refer to the 
Talmud. How strange is the destiny of the Jews, those scapegoats, martyrs and 
saviours of the world, a people full of vitality, a bold and hardy race, which perse- 
cutions have preserved intact, because it has not yet accomplished its mission! Do 
not our apostolical traditions declare that after the decline of faith among the 
Gentiles salvation shall again come forth out of the house of Jacob, and that then 
the crucified Jew Who is adored by the Christians will give the empire of the 
world into the hands of God His Father? 
 On penetrating into the sanctuary of the Kabalah one is seized with admiration 
in the presence of a doctrine so logical, so simple and at the same time so abso- 
lute. The essential union of ideas and signs; the consecration of the most funda-

12 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic 
mental realities by primi tive characters; the trinity of words, letters and numbers;
a philosophy simple as the alphabet, profound and infinite as the Word; theorems
more complete and luminous than those of Pythagoras; a theology which may be 
summed up on the fingers; an infinite which can be held in the hollow of an 
infant's hand; ten figures and twenty-two letters, a triangle, a square and a circle:
such are the elements of the Kabalah. Such also are the component principles of
the written Word, reflection of that spoken Word which created the world! All 
truly dogmatic religions have issued from the Kabalah and return therein. What-
soever is grand or scientific in the religious dreams of the illuminated, of Jacob
Bohme, Swedenborg, Saint-Martin and the rest, is borrowed from the Kabalah; all
Masonic associations owe toit their secr ets and their symbols. The Kabalah alone
consecrates the alliance of universal reason and the Divine Word; it establishes by
the counterpoise of two forces in apparnt oppositioe n, the eternal balance of
being; it alone reconciles reason with faith, power with liberty, science with mys-
tery: it has the keys of the present, past and future! 
 To become initiated into the Kabalah it is insufficient to read and to meditate
upon the writings of Reuchlin, Galatinus, Kircher, or Picus de Mirandola; it is
necessary to study and understand the Hebrew writers in the collection of Pisto-
rius, the Sepher Yetzirah above all; it is essential in particular to master the great
book Zohar, to investigate the collection of 1684, entitled Kabbala Denudata ,
especially the treatise on “Kabalistic Pneumatics” and that on the “Revolution of
Souls”; and afterwards to enter boldly into the luminous darkness of the whole
dogmatic and allegorical body of the Talmud. We shall be then in a position to
understand William Postel, and shall admit secretly that – apart from his very
premature and overgenerous dreams about the emancipation of women – this cel- 
ebrated, learned, illuminated man could not have been so mad as is pretended by
those who have not read him. 
 We have sketched rapidly the history of occult philosophy; we have indicated
its sources and analysed in a few words its chief memorials. The present division
of our work refers only to the science, but Magic, or rather magical power, com-
prehends two things, a science and a fore: without the forc ce the science is noth-
ing, or rather it is a danger. To give knowledge to power alone, such is the 
supreme law of initiations. Hence did the Great Revealer say: `The kingdom of 
heaven suffereth violence, and the violent only shall carry it away.' The door of
truth is closed, like the sanctuary of a virgin: he must be a man who would enter.
All miracles are promised to faith, and what is faith except the audacity of will
which does not hesitate in the darkness, but advances towards the light in spite of
all ordeals, and surmounting all obstacles? It is unnecessary to repeat here the
history of ancient initiations: the more dangerous and terrible they were, the
greater was their efficacy. Hence, in those days, the world had men to govern and
instruct it. The Sacerdotal Art and the Royal Art consisted above all in ordeals of

courage, discretion and will. It was a novitiate similar to that of those priests who, 
under the name of Jesuits, are so unpopular at the present day, but would govern 
the world notwithstanding, had they a truly wise and intelligent chief. 
 After passing our life in the search for the Absolute in religion, science and jus- 
tice; after revolving in the circle of Faust, we have reached the primal doctrine 
and the first book of humanity. At this point we pause, having discovered the 
secret of human omnipotence and indefinite progress, the key of all symbolisms, 
the first and final doctrine: we have come to understand what was meant by that 
expression so often made use of in the Gospel – the Kingdom of God. 
 To provide a fixed point as a fulcrum for human activity is to solve the problem 
of Archimedes, by realizing the use of his famous lever. This it is which was 
accomplished by the great initiators who have electrified the world, and they 
could not have done so except by means of the Great and Incommunicable Secret. 
However, as a guarantee of its renewed youth, the symbolical phoenix never reap- 
peared before the eyes of the world without having consumed solemnly the 
remains and evidences of its previous life. So also Moses saw to it that all those 
who had known Egypt and her mysteries should end their life in the desert; at 
Ephesus St. Paul burnt all books which treated of the occult sciences; and in fine, 
the French Revolution, daughter of the great Johannite Orient and the ashes of 
the Templars, spoliated the churches and blasphemed the allegories of the Divine 
Cultus. But all doctrines and all revivals proscribe Magic and condemn its myster- 
ies to the flames and to oblivion. The reason is that each religion or philosophy 
which comes into the world is a Benjamin of humanity and insures its own life by 
destroying its mother. It is because the symbolical serpent turns ever devouring its 
own tail; it is because, as essential condition of existence, a void is necessary to 
every plenitude, space for every dimension, an affirmation for each negation: 
herein is the eternal realization of the phoenix allegory. 
 Two illustrious scholars have preceded me along the path that I am travelling, 
but they have, so to speak, spent the dark night therein. I refer to Volney and 
Dupuis, to Dupuis above all, whose immense erudition produced only a negative 
work, for in the origin of all religions he saw nothing but astronomy, taking thus 
the symbolic cycle for doctrine and the calendar for legend. He was deficient in 
one branch of knowledge, that of true Magic which comprises the secrets of the 
Kabalah. Dupuis passed through the antique sanctuaries, like the prophet Ezekiel 
over the plain strewn with bones, and only understood death, for want of that 
word which collects the virtue of the four winds and can make a living people of 
all the vast ossuary, by crying to the ancient symbols: ‘Arise! Take up a new form 
and walk!’ But the hour has come when we must have the courage to attempt 
what no one has dared to perform previously. Like Julian, we would rebuild the 
temple, and in so doing we do not believe that we shall be belying a wisdom that 
we venerate, which also Julian would himself have been worthy to adore, had the

rancorous and fanatical doctors of his period permitted him to understand it. For
us the Temple has two Pillars, on one of which Christianity has inscribed its
name. We have therefore no wish to attack Christianity : far from it, we seek to
explain and accomplish it. Intelligence and will have exercised alternately their
power in the world; religion and philosophy are still at war with one another, but
they must end in agreement. The provisional object of Christianity was to estab-
lish, by obedience and faith, a supernatural or religious equality among men, to
immobilize intelligence by faith, so as to provide a fulcrum for virtue which came
for the destruction of the aristocracy of science, or rather to replace that aristoc-
racy, then already destroyed. Philosophy, on the contrary, has laboured to bring
back men by liberty and reason to natural inequality, and to substitute wits for
virtue by inaugurating the reign of industry. Neither of these operations has
proved complete or adequate; neither has brought men to perfection and felicity.
That which is now dreamed, almost without daring to hope for it, is an alliance
between the two forces so long regarded as contrary, and there is good ground for
desiring it, seeing that these two great powers of the human soul are no more
opposed to one another than is the sex of man opposed to that of woman.
Undoubtedly they differ, but their apparently contrary dispositions come only
from their aptitude to meet and unite.
 “No less is proposed, therefore, than a universal solution of all problems?”
 The answer is yes, unquestionably, since we are concerned with explaining the
Philosophical Stone, perpetual motion, the secret of the Great Work and of the
Universal Medicine. We shall be accused of insanity, like the divine Paracelsus, or
of charlatanism, like the great and unfortunate Agrippa. If the pyre of Urban
Grandier be extinguished, the sullen proscriptions of silence and of calumny
remain., We do not defy but are resigned to them. We have not sought the publi-
cation of this book of our own will, and we believe that if the time be come to bear
witness, it will be borne by us or by others. We shall therefore remain calm and
shall wait. 
 Our work is in two parts: in the one we establish the kabalistic and magical
doctrine in its entirety; the other is consecrated to the cultus, that is, to Ceremo-
nial Magic. The one is that which the ancient sages termed the Clavicle, the other
that which people on the country-side still call the Grimoire. The numbers and
subjects of the chapters which correspond in both parts, are in no sense arbitrary,
and are all indicated in the great universal key, of which we give for the first time
a complete and adequate explanation. Let this work now go its way where it will
and become what Providence determines; it is finished, and we believe it to be
enduring, because it is strong, like all that is reasonable and conscientious.

 I ' A 
 THE CANDIDA TE 
 DISCIPLINA ENSOPH KETHERI 
WHEN a philosopher adopted as the basis for a new apocalypse of human wisdom 
the axiom: “I think, therefore I am”, in a measure he altered unconsciously, from 
the standpoint of Christian Revelation, the old conception of the Supreme Being. I 
am that I am, said the Being of beings of Moses. I amhe who thinks, says the man 
of Descartes, and to think being to speak inwardly, such a one may affirm, like 
the God of St. John the Evangelist: I am he in whom and by whom the word man- 
ifests – In principio eras verbum. Now, what is this principle? It is a groundwork 
of speech, it is a reason for the existence of the word. The essence of the word is in 
the principle; the principle is that which is; intelligence is a principle which 
speaks. What further is intellectual light? It is speech. What is revelation? It is 
speech also, being is the principle, speech is the means, and the plenitude or 
development and perfection of being is the end. To speak is to create. But to say: 
“I think, therefore I exist”, is to argue from consequence to principle, and certain 
contradictions which have been adduced by a great writer, Lamennais, have 
proved abundantly the philosophical unsoundness of this method. I am, therefore 
something exists might seem to be a more primitive and simple foundation for 
experimental philosophy. I AM, THEREFORE BEING EXISTS . Ego sum qui sum, such is 
the first revelation of God in man and of man in the world, while it is also the first 
axiom of occult philosophy. xvx' wc' xvx' . Being is being. Hence this philoso- 
phy, having that which is for its principle, can be in no sense hypothesis or guess- 
work. 
 Mercurius Trismegistus begins his admirable symbol known under the name of 
the “Emerald Table,” by this threefold affirmation: “It is true, it is certain without 
error, it is of all truth.” Thus, in physics, the true confirmed by experience; in phi- 
losophy, certitude purged from any alloy of error; in the domain of religion or the 
infinite, absolute truth indi cated by analogy: such are the first necessities of true 
science, and Magic only can impart these to its adepts. 
 But you, before all things, who are you, thus taking this work in your hands 
and proposing to read it? On the pediment of a temple consecrated by antiquity to 
the God of Light was an inscription of two words: “Know thyself.” I impress the 
same counsel on every man when he seeks to approach science. Magic, which the 
men of old denominated the SANCTUM REGNUM , the Holy Kingdom, or Kingdom 
of God, REGNUM DEI , exists only for kings and for priests. Are you priests? Are 
you kings? The priesthood of Magic is not a vulgar priesthood, and its royalty 
enters not into competition with the princes of this world. The monarchs of sci- 
ence are the priests of truth, and their sovereignty is hidden from the multitude,

like their prayers and sacrifices. The kings of science are men who know the truth
and them the truth has made free, according to the specific promise given by the
most mighty of all initiators.
 The man who is enslaved by his passions or worldly prejudices can be initiated
in no wise; he must reform or he will never attain; meanwhile he cannot be an
adept, for this word signifies a person who has achieved by will and by work. The
man who loves his own opinions and fears to part with them, who suspects new
truths, who is unprepared to doubt everything rather than admit anything on
chance, should close this book: for him it is useless and dangerous. He will fail to
understand it, and it will trouble him, while if he should divine the meaning, there
will be a still greater source of disquietude. If you hold by anything in the world
more than by reason, truth and justice; if your will be uncertain and vacillating,
either in good or evil; if logic alarm you, or the naked truth make you blush; if
you are hurt when accepted errors are assailed; condemn this work straight away.
Do not read it; let it cease to exist for you; but at the same time do not cry it down
as dangerous. The secrets which it records will be understood by an elect few and
will be reserved by those who understand them. Show light to the birds of the
night-time, and you hide their light; it is the light which blinds them and for them
is darker than darkness. It follows that I shall speak clearly and make known
everything, with the firm conviction that initiates alone, or those who deserve ini-
tiation, will read al l and understand in part.
 There is a true and a false science, a Divine and an Infernal Magic – in other

words, one which is delusive and tenebrous. It is our task to reveal the one and to 
unveil the other, to distinguish the magician from the sorcerer and the adept from 
the charlatan. The magician avails himself of a force which he knows, the sorcerer 
seeks to misuse that which he does not understand. If it be possible in a scientific 
work to employ a term so vulgar and so discredited, then the devil gives himself to 
the magician and the sorcerer gives himself to the devil. The magician is the sov- 
ereign pontiff of Nature, the sorcerer is her profaner only. The sorcerer is in the 
same relation to the magician that a superstitious and fanatical person bears to a 
truly religious man. 
 Before proceeding further, let us define Magic in a sentence. Magic is the tradi- 
tional science of the secrets of Nature which has been transmitted to us from the 
Magi. 
 By means of this science the adept is invested with a species of relative omnip- 
otence and can operate superhumanly, that is, after a manner which transcends 
the normal possibility of men. Thereby many illustrious hierophants, such as Mer- 
curius Trismegistus, Osiris, Orpheus, Apollonius of Tyana, and others whom it 
might be dangerous or unwise to name, came after their death to be adored and 
invoked as gods. Thereby others also – according to that ebb-and-flow of opinion 
which is responsible for the caprices of success – became emissaries of infernus or 
suspected adventurers, like the Emperor Julian, Apuleius, the enchanter Merlin 
and that arch sorcerer, as he was termed in his day, the illustrious and unfortunate 
Cornelius Agrippa. 
 To attain the SANCTUM REGNUM , in other words, the knowledge and power of 
the Magi, there are four indispensable conditions – an intelligence illuminated by 
study, an intrepidity which nothing can check, a will which cannot be broken, and 
a prudence which nothing can corrupt and nothing intoxicate. TO KNOW, TO DARE , 
TO WILL, TO KEEP SILENCE – such are the four words of the Magus, inscribed upon 
the four symbolical forms of the sphinx. These maxims can be combined after 
four manners and explained four times by one another. 
 On the first page of the Book of Hermes the adept is depicted with a large hat, 
which, if turned down, would conceal his entire head. One hand is raised towards 
heaven, which he seems to command with his wand, while the other is placed 
upon his breast; before him are the chief symbols or instruments of science, and 
he has others hidden in a juggler's wallet. His body and arms form the letter 
ALEPH , the first of that alphabet which the Jews borrowed from the Egyptians: to 
this symbol we shall have occasion to recur later on. 
 The Magus is truly that which the Hebrew Kabalists term Microprosopus – oth- 
erwise, the creator of the little world. The first of all magical sciences being the 
knowledge of one's self, so is one's own creation first of all works of science; it 
comprehends the others and is the beginning of the Great Work. The expression, 
however, requires explanation. Supreme Reason being the sole invariable and

consequently imperishable principle – and death, as we call it, being change – it
follows that the intelligence which cleaves closely to this principle and in a man-
ner identifies itself therewith, does hereby make itself unchangeable and as a
result immortal. To cleave invariably to reason it will be understood that it is nec-
essary to attain independence of all those forces which by their fatal and inevita-
ble operation produce the alternatives of life and death. To know how to suffer, to
forbear and to die – such are the first secrets which place us beyond reach of
affliction, the desires of the flesh and the fear of annihilation. The man who seeks
and finds a glorious death has faith in immortality and universal humanity
believes in it with him and for him, raising altars and statues to his memory in
token of eternal life. 
 Man becomes king of the brutes only by subduing or taming them: otherwise
he will be their victim or slave. Brutes are the type of our passions; they are the
instinctive forces of Nature. The world is a field of battle, where liberty struggles
with inertia by the opposition of active force. Physical laws are millstones; if you
cannot be the miller you must be the grain. You are called to be king of air, water,
earth and fire; but to reign over these four living creatures of symbolism, it is nec-
essary to conquer and enchain them. He who aspires to be a sage and to know the
Great Enigma of Nature must be the heir and despoiler of the sphinx: his the
human head, in order to possess speech; his the eagle's wings, in order to scale the
heights; his the bull's flanks, in order to furrow the depths; his the lion's talons, to
make a way on the right and the left, before and behind.
 You therefore who seek initiation, are you learned as Faust? Are you insensible
as Job? No, is it not so? But you may become like unto both if you choose. Have
you overcome the vortices of vague thoughts? Are you without indecision or capri-
ciousness? Do you consent to pleasure only when you will, and do you wish for it
only when you should? No, is it not so? Not at least invariably, but this may come
to pass if you choose. The sphinx has not only a man's head, it has woman's
breasts; do you know how to resist feminine charms? No, is it not so? And you
laugh outright in replying, parading your moral weakness for the glorification of
your physical and vital force. Be it so: I allow you to render this homage to the ass
of Sterne or Apuleius. The ass has its merit, I agree; it was consecrated to Priapus
as was the goat to the god of Mendes. But take it for what it is worth, and decide
whether ass or man shall be master. He alone can possess truly the pleasure of
love who has conquered the love of pleasur. Te o be able and to forbear is to be
twice able. Woman enchains you by your desires; master your desires and you will
enchain her. The greatest injury that can be inflicted on a man is to call him a
coward. Now, what is a cowardly person? One who neglects his moral dignity in
order to obey blindly the instincts of Nature. As a fact, in the presence of danger it
is natural to be afraid and seek flight: why, then, is it shameful? Because honour
has erected it into a law that we must prefer our duty to our inclinations or fears.



--------------------------------------- 23

 THE CANDIDATE 5
What is honour from this point of view? It is a universal presentience of immor- 
tality and appreciation of the means which can lead to it. The last trophy which a 
man can win from death is to triumph over the appetite for life, not by despair 
but by a more exalted hope, which is contained in faith, for all that is noble and 
honest, by the undivided consent of the world. To learn self-conquest is therefore 
to learn life, and the austerities of stoicism were no vain parade of freedom! To 
yield to the forces of Nature is to follow the stream of collective life and to be the 
slave of secondary causes. Tor esist and subdue Nature is to make for one's self a 
personal and imperishable life: it is to break free from the vicissitudes of life and 
death. Every man who is prepared to die rather than renounce truth and justice is 
most truly living, for immort ality abides in his soul. To find or to form such men 
was the end of all ancient initiations. Pythagoras disciplined his pupils by silence 
and all kinds of self-denial; candidates in Egypt were tried by the four elements; 
and we know the self-inflicted austerities of fakirs and brahmans in India for 
attaining the kingdom of free will and divine independence. All macerations of 
asceticism are borrowed from the initiations of the Ancient Mysteries; they have 
ceased because those qualified for initiation, no longer finding initiators, and the 
leaders of conscience becoming in the lapse of time as uninstructed as the vulgar, 
the blind have grown weary of following the blind, and no one has cared to pass 
through ordeals the end of which was only in doubt and despair: the path of light 
was lost. To succeed in performing something we must know that which it is pro- 
posed to do, or at least must have faith in someone who does know it. But shall I 
stake my life on a venture, or follow someone at chance who himself cannot see 
where he is going? 
 We must not set out rashly along the path of the transcendental sciences, but, 
once started, we must reach the end or perish. To doubt is to lose one's reason; to 
pause is to fall; to recoil is to plunge into an abyss. You, therefore, who are under- 
taking the study of this book, if you persevere to the end and understand it, you 
will be either a monarch or madman. Do what you will with the volume, you will 
be unable to despise or to forget it. If you are pure, it will be your light; if strong, 
your arm; if holy, your religion; if wise, the rule of your wisdom. But if you are 
wicked, for you it will be an infernal torch; it will lacerate your breast like a pon- 
iard; it will rankle in your memory like a remorse; it will people your imagination 
with chimeras, and will drive you through folly to despair. You will endeavour to 
laugh at it, and will only gnash your teeth; it will be like the filein the fable which 
the serpent tried to bite, but it destroyed all his teeth. 
 Let us now enter on the series of initiations. I have said that revelation is the 
word. As a fact, the word, or speech, is the veil of being and the characteristic sign 
of life. Every form is the veil of a word, because the idea which is the mother of 
the word is the sole reason for the existence of forms. Every figure is a character, 
every character derives from and returns into a word. For this reason the ancient

6 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
sages, of whom Trismegistus is the organ, formulated their sole dogma in these
terms: “That which is above is like unto that which is below, and that which is
below unto that which is above.” In other words, the form is proportional to the
idea; the shadow is the measure of the body calculated in its relation to the lumi-
nous ray; the scabbard is as deep as the sword is long; the negation is in propor-
tion to the contrary affirmation; production is equal to destruction in the
movement which preserves life; and there is no point in infinite extension which
may not be regarded as the centre of a circle having an expanding circumference
receding indefinitely into space. Every individuality is therefore indefinitely per-
fectible, since the moral order is analogous to the physical, and since we cannot
conceive any point as unable to dilate, increase and radiate in a philosophically
unlimited circle. What can be affirmed of the soul in its totality may be affirmed
of each faculty of the soul. The intelligence and will of man are instruments of
incalculable power and capacity. But intelligence and will possess as their
help-mate and instrument a faculty which is too imperfectly known, the omnipo-
tence of which belongs exclusively to the domain of Magic. I speak of the imagina-
tion, which the Kabalists term the DIAPHANE or TRANSLUCID . Imagination, in
effect, is like the soul's eye; therein forms are outlined and preserved; thereby we
behold the reflections of the invisible world; it is the glass of visions and the appa-
ratus of magical life. By its intervention we heal diseases, modify the seasons,
warn off death from the living and raise the dead to life, because it is the imagina-
tion which exalts will and gives it power over the Universal Agent. Imagination
determines the shape of the child in its mother's womb and decides the destiny of
men; it lends wings to contagion and directs the arms of warfare. Are you exposed
in battle? Believe yourself to be invulnerable like Achilles, and you will be so, says
Paracelsus. Fear attracts bullets, but they are repelled by courage. It is well
known that persons with amputated limbs feel pain in the vicinity of members
which they possess no longer. Paracelsus operated upon living blood by medicat-
ing the product of a bleeding; he cured headache at a distance by treating hair cut
from the patient. By the science of the theoretical unity and solidarity between all
parts of the body, he anticipated and outstripped the theories, or rather experi-
ences, of our most celebrated magnetists. Hence his cures were miraculous, and to
his name of Philip Theophrastus Bombast, he deserved the addition of Aureolus
Paracelsus, with the furt her epithet of divine!
 Imagination is the instrument of THE ADAPTATION OF THE WORD. Imagination
applied to reason is genius. Reason is one, as genius is one, in all the variety of its
works. There is one principle, there is one truth, there is one reason, there is one
absolute and universal philosophy. Whatsoever is subsists in unity, considered as
beginning, and returns into unity, considered as end. One is in one; that is to say,
all is in all. Unity is the principle of numbers; it is also the principle of motion and
consequently of life., The entire human body is recapitulated in the unity of a sin-

gle organ, which is the brain. All religions are summed up in the unity of a single 
dogma, which is the affirmation of being and its equality with itself, and this con- 
stitutes its mathematical value . There is only one dogma in Magic, and it is this: 
The visible is the manifestation of the invisible, or, in other terms, the perfect 
word, in things appreciable and visible, bears an exact proportion to the things 
which are inappreciable by our senses and unseen by our eyes. The Magus raises 
one hand towards heaven and points down with the other to earth, saying: 
“Above, immensity: Below immensity still! Immensity equals immensity.” – This 
is true in things seen, as in things unseen. 
 The first letter in the alphabet of the sacred language, Aleph, ' , represents a 
man extending one hand towards heaven and the other to earth. It is an expres- 
sion of the active principle in everything; it is creation in heaven corresponding to 
the omnipotence of the word below. This letter is a pantacle in itself – that is, a 
character expressing the universal science. It is supplementary to the sacred signs 
of the Macrocosm and Microcosm; it explains the Masonic double-triangle and 
five-pointed blazing star; for the word is one and revelation is one. By endowing 
man with reason, God gave him speech; and revelation, manifold in its forms but 
one in its principle, consists entirely in the universal word, the interpreter of abso- 
lute reason. This is the significance of that term so much misconstrued, CATHOLIC - 
ITY, which, in modern hieratic language, means INFALLIBILITY. The universal in 
reason is the Absolute, and the Absolute is the infallible. If absolute reason 
impelled universal society to believe irresistibly the utterance of a child, that child 
would be infallible by the ordination of God and of all humanity. Faith is nothing 
else but reasonable confidence in this unity of reason and in this universality of 
the word. To believe is to place confidence in that which as yet we do not know 
when reason assures us beforehand of ultimately knowing or at least recognizing 
it. Absurd are the so-called philosophers who cry: “I will never believe in a thing 
which I do not know!” Shallow reasoners! If you knew, would you need to 
believe? 
 But must I believe on chance and apart from reason? 
 Certainly not. Blind and haphazard belief is superstition and folly. We may 
have faith in causes which reason compels us to admit on the evidence of effects 
known and appreciated by science. Science! Great word and great problem! What 
is science? We shall answer in the second chapter of this book.

 THE PILLARS OF THE TEMPLE 
 CHOKMAH DOMUS GNOSIS 
 SCIENCE is the absolute and complete possession of truth. Hence have the sages 
of all the centuries trembled before such an absolute and terrible word; they have 
hesitated in arrogating to themselves the first privilege of Divinity by assuming 
the possession of science, and have been contented, instead of the verb TO KNOW, 
with that which expresses learning, while, in place of the wordSCIENCE , they have
adopted that of GNOSIS , which represents simply the notion of learning by intu- 
ition. What, in fact, does man know? Nothing, and at the same time he is allowed 
to ignore nothing. Devoid of knowledge, he is called upon to know all. Now, 
knowledge supposes the duad – a being who knows and an object known. The 
duad is the generator of society and of law: it is also the number of the Gnosis. 
The duad is unity multiplying itself in order to create, and hence in sacred sym- 
bolism Eve issues from the inmost bosom of Adam. Adam is the human tetra- 
gram, summed up in the mysterious JOD, type of the kabalistic phallus. By adding 
to this JOD the triadic name of Eve, the name of Jehova is formed, the Divine Tet- 
ragram, which is eminently the kabalistic and magical word, xnxv, being that 
which the high-priest in the temple pronounced JODCHEVA . So unity, complete in 
the fruitfulness of the triad, forms therewith the tetrad, which is the key of all 
numbers, of all movements and of all forms. By a revolution about its own centre, 
the square produces a circle equal to itself, and this is the quadrature of the circle, 
the circular movement of four equal angles around the same point. 
 “That which is above equals that which is below,” says Hermes. Here then is 
the duad serving as the measure of unity and the r, elation of equality between
above and below forms with these the triad. The creative principle is the ideal 
phallus; the created principle is the formal cteis. The insertion of the vertical 
phallus into the horizontal cteis forms the stauros of the Gnostics, or the philo- 
sophical cross of Masons. Thus, the intersection of two produces four, which, by 
its movement, defines the circle with all degrees thereof. 
 ' is man; h is woman; 1 is the principle; 2 is the word; A is the active; B is the 
passive; the monad is BOAZ; the duad is JAKIN . In the trigrams of Fohi, unity is the 
YANG and the duad is the YIN.

 THE PILLARS OF THE TEMPLE 9
 BOAZ and JAKIN are the names of the two symbolical Pillars before the principal 
entrance of Solomon's Kabalistic Temple. In the Kabalah these Pillars explain all 
mysteries of antagonism, whether natural, political or religious. They elucidate 
also the procreative struggle between man and woman, for, according to the law 
of Nature, the woman must resist the man, and he must entice or overcome her. 
The active principle seeks the passive principle, the plenum desires the void, the 
serpent's jaw attracts the serpent's tail, and in turnin g about upon himself, he, at 
the same time, flies and pursues himself. Woman is the creation of man, and uni- 
versal creation is the bride of the First Principle. 
 When the Supreme Being became a Creator, He erected a JOD or a phallus, and 
to provide a place in the fullness of the uncreated light, it was necessary to hollow 
out a cteis or trench of shadow equivalent to the dimension determined by his cre- 
ative desire, and attributed by him to the ideal JOD of the radiating light. Such is 
the mysterious language of the Kabalists in the Talmud, and on account of vulgar 
ignorance and malignity, it is impossible for us to explain or simplify it further. 
What then is creation? It is the house of the creative Word. What is the cteis? It is 
the house of the phallus. What is the nature of the active principle? To diffuse. 
What is that of the passive? To gather in and to fructify. What is man? He who 
initiates, who toils, who furrows, who sows. What is woman? She who forms, 
unites, irrigates and harvest s. Man wages war, woman brings peace about; man 
destroys to create, woman builds up to preserve; man is revolution, woman is con- 
ciliation; man is the father of Cain, woman the mother of Abel. What also is wis- 
dom? It is the agreement and union of two principles, the mildness of Abel 
directing the activity of Cain, man guided by the sweet inspirations of woman, 
debauchery conquered by lawful marriage, revolutionary energy softened and 
subdued by the gentleness of order and peace, pride subjugated by love, science 
acknowledging the inspirations of faith. It is then that science becomes wise and 
submits to the infallibilit y of universal reason, instructed by love or universal 
charity. Then it can assume the name of GNOSIS , because it knows at least that as 
yet it cannot boast of knowing perfectly. 
 The monad can manifest only by the duad; unity itself and the notion of unity 
at once constitute two. The unity of the Macrocosm reveals itself by the two oppo- 
site points of two triangles. Human unity fulfils itself to righ t and left. Primitive 
man is androgynous. All organs of the human body are disposed in pairs, except- 
ing the nose, the tongue, the umbilicus and the kabalistic JOD. Divinity, one in its 
essence, has two essential conditions as the fundamental grounds of its being – 
necessity and liberty. The laws of supreme reason necessitate and rule liberty in 
God, Who is of necessity wise and reasonable. 
 To make light visible God had only to postulate shadow. To manifest the truth 
He permitted the possibility of doubt. The shadow bodies forth the light, and the 
possibility of error is essential for the temporal manifestation of truth. If the buck-

ler of Satan did not intercept the spear of Michael, the might of the angel would
be lost in the void or manifested by infinite destruction launched below from
above. Did not the heel of Michael restrain Satan in his ascent, Satan would
dethrone God, or rather he would lose himself in the abysses of the altitude.
Hence Satan is needful to Michael as the pedestal to the statue, and Michael is
necessary to Satan as the brake to the locomotive. In analogical and universal
dynamics one leans only on that which resists. Furthermore, the universe is bal-
anced by two forces which maintain it in equilibrium, being the force which
attracts and that which repels. They exist alike in physics, in philosophy and in
religion; in physics they produce equilibrium, in philosophy criticism, in religion
progressive revelation. The ancients represented this mystery by the conflict
between Eros and Anteros, the struggle between Jacob and the angel, and by the
equilibrium of the golden mountain, which gods on the one side and demons on
the other encircle with the symbolic serpent of India. It is typified also by the
caduceus of Hermanubis, by the two cherubim of the ark, by the twofold sphinx
of the chariot of Osiris and by the twoseraphim – r espectively black and white. Its
scientific reality is demonstrated by the phenomena of polarity, as also by the uni-
versal law of sympathies and antipathies. 
 The undiscerning disciples of Zoroaster divided the duad without referring it to
unity, thus separating the Pillars of the Temple and endeavouring to halve God.
Conceive the Absolute as two, and you must immediately conceive it as three to
recover the unity principle. For this reason, the material elements, analogous to
the divine elements, are understood firstly as four, explained as two and exist ulti-
mately as three. 
 Revelation is the duad; every word is double, and supposes two. The ethic
which results from revelation is founded on antagonism, and this results from the
duad. Spirit and form attract and repel one another, like sign and idea, fiction and
truth. Supreme Reason necessitates dogma when communicating to finite intelli-
gences, and dogma by its passage from the domain of ideas to that of forms, par-
ticipates in two worlds and has inevitably two senses testifying in succession or

 THE PILLARS OF THE TEMPLE 11
simultaneously, that is, to the spirit and the flesh. So are there two forces in the 
moral region, one which attacks and one which restrains and expiates. They are 
represented in the mythos of Genesis by the typical personalities of Cain and Abel. 
Abel oppresses Cain by reason of his moral superiority; Cain to get free immortal- 
izes his brother by slaying him and becomes the victim of his own crime. Cain 
could not suffer the life of Abel, and the blood of Abel suffers not the sleep of 
Cain. In the Gospel the type of Cain is replaced by that of the Prodigal Son, whom 
his father forgives freely because he returns after having endured much. 
 There is mercy and there is justice in God; to the just He dispenses justice and 
to sinners mercy. In the soul of the world, which is the Universal Agent, there is a 
current of love and a current of wrath. This ambient and all-penetrating fluid; 
this ray loosened from the sun's splendour and fixed by the weight of the atmo- 
sphere and the power of central attraction; this body of the Holy Spirit, which we 
term the Universal Agent, while it was typified by the ancients under the symbol 
of a serpent devouring its tail; this electromagnetic ether, this vital and luminous 
caloric, is depicted in archaic monuments by the girdle of Isis, twice-folded in a 
love-knot round two poles, as well as by the serpent devouring its own tail, 
emblematic of prudence and of Saturn. Motion and life consist in the extreme ten- 
sion of two forces. “I would thou wert cold or hot,” said the Master. As a fact, a 
great sinner is more really alive than is a tepid, effeminate man, and the fullness 
of his return to virtue will be in proportion to the extent of his errors. She who is 
destined to crush the serpent's head is intelligence, which ever rises above the 
stream of blind forces. The Kabalists call her the virgin of the sea, whose dripping 
feet the infernal dragon crawls forward to lick with his fiery tongues, and they fall 
asleep in delight. 
 Hereof are the hieratic mysteries of the duad. But there is one, and the last of 
all, which must not be made known, the reason, according to Hermes Trismegis- 
tus, being the malcomprehension of the vulgar, who would ascribe to the necessi- 
ties of science the immoral aspect of blind fatality. “By the fear of the unknown 
must the crowd be restrained,” he observes in another place; and Christ also said: 
“Cast not your pearls before swine, lest, trampling them under their feet, they 
turn and rend you.” The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, of which the 
fruits are death, is the type of this hieratic secret of the duad, which would be only 
misconstrued if divulged, and would lead commonly to the unholy denial of free 
will, though it is the principle of moral life. It is hence in the essence of things that 
the revelation of this secret means death, and it is not at the same time the Great 
Secret of Magic; but the arcanum of the duad leads up to that of the tetrad, or 
more correctly proceeds therefrom, and is resolved by the triad, which contains 
the word of that enigma propounded by the sphinx, the finding of which would 
have saved the life, atoned for the unconscious crime and established the kingdom 
of Oedipus. 



--------------------------------------- 30

12 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
 In the hieroglyphic work of Hermes, being the Tarot or Book of Thoth, the
duad is represented either by the horns of Isis, who has her head veiled and an
open book concealed partially under her mantle, or otherwise by a sovereign lady,
Juno, the Greek goddess, with one hand uplifted towards heaven and the other
pointed to earth, as if formulating by this gesture the one and twofold dogma
which is the foundation of Magic and begins the marvellous symbols of the
“Emerald Table” of Hermes. In the Apocalypse of St. John there is reference to
two witnesses or martyrs on whom prophetic tradition confers the names of Elias
and Enoch-Elias, man of faith, enthusiasm, miracle; Enoch, one with him who is
called Hermes by the Egyptians, honoured by the Phoenicians as Cadmus, author
of the sacred alphabet and the universal key to the initiations of the Logos, father
of the Kabalah, he who, according to sacred allegories, did not die like other men,
but was translated to heaven, and will return at the end of time. Much the same
parable is told of St. John himself, who recovered and explained in his Apocalypse
the symbolism of the word of Enoch. This resurrection of St. John and Enoch,
expected at the close of the ages of ignorance, will be the renovation of their doc-
trine by the comprehension of the kabalistic keys which unlock the temple of
unity and of universal philosophy, too long occult and reserved solely for the elect,
who perish at the hands of the world.
 But we have said that the reproduction of the monad by the duad leads of
necessity to the conception and dogma of the triad, so we come now to this great
number, which is the fullness and perfect word of unity.

 III g C 
 THE TRIANGLE OF SO LOMON 
 PLENITUDO VOCIS BINAH PHYSIS 
 THE perfect word is the triad, because it supposes an intelligent principle, a 
speaking principle and a principle spoken. The Absolute, revealed by speech, 
endows this speech with a sense equivalent to itself, and in the understanding 
thereof creates its third self. So also the sun manifests by its light and proves or 
makes this manifestation efficacious by heat. 
 The triad is delineated in space by the heavenly zenith, the infinite height, con- 
nected with East and West by two straight diverging lines. With this visible trian- 
gle reason compares another which is invisible, but is assumed to be equal in 
dimension; the abyss is its apex and its reversed base is parallel to the horizontal 
line stretching from East to West. These two triangles, combined in a single figure, 
which is the six-pointed star, form the sacred symbol of Solomon's Seal, the 
resplendent Star of the Macrocosm. The notion of the Infinite and the Absolute is 
expressed by this sign, which is the grand pantacle – that is to say, the most sim- 
ple and complete abridgement of the science of all things. 
 Grammar itself attributes three persons to the verb. The first is that which 
speaks, the second that which is spoken to, and the third the object. In creating, 
the Infinite Prince speaks to Himself of Himself. Such is the explanation of the 
triad and the origin of the dogma of the Trinity. The magical dogma is also one in 
three and three in one. That which is above is like or equal to that which is below. 
Thus, two things which resemble one another and the word which signifies their 
resemblance make three. The triad is the universal dogma. In Magic – principle, 
realization, adaptation; in alchemy – azoth, incorporation, transmutation; in the- 
ology – God, incarnation, redemption; in the human soul – thought, love and 
action; in the family – father, mother and child. The triad is the end and supreme 
expression of love; we seek one another as two only to become three. 
 There are three intelligible worlds which correspond one with another by hier- 
archic analogy; the natural or physical, the spiritual or metaphysical, and the 
divine or religious worlds. From this principle follows the hierarchy of spirits, 
divided into three orders, and again subdivided by the triad in each of these. 
 All these revelations are logical deductions from the first mathematical notions 
of being and number. Unity must multiply itself in order to become active. An 
indivisible, motionless and sterile principle would be unity dead and incompre- 
hensible. Were God only one He would never be Creator or Father. Were He two 
there would be antagonism or division in the infinite, which would mean the divi- 
sion also or death of all possible things. He is therefore three for the creation by

Himself and in His image of the infinite multitude of beings and numbers. So is
He truly one in Himself and triple in our conception, which also leads us to behold
Him as triple in Himself and one in our intelligence and our love. This is a mys-
tery for the faithful and a logical necessity for the initiate into absolute and real
sciences. 
 The Word manifested by life is realization or incarnation. The life of the Word
accomplishing its cyclic movement is adaptation or redemption. This triple
dogma was known in all sanctuaries illuminated by the tradition of the sages. Do
you wish to ascertain which is the true religion? Seek that which realizes most in
the Divine Order, which humanizes God and makes man divine, which preserves
the triadic dogma intact, which clothes the Word with flesh by making God man-
ifest to the hands and eyes of the most ignorant, which in fine appeals to all in its
doctrine and can adapt itself to all – the religion which is hierarchic and cyclic,
having allegories and images for children, an exalted philosophy for grown men,
sublime hopes and sweet consolations for the old.
 The primeval sages, when seeking the First of Causes, behold good and evil in
the world. They considered shadow and light; they compared winter with spring,
age with youth, life with death, and their conclusion was this: The First Cause is
beneficent and severe; It gives and takes away life. Then are there two contrary
principles, the one good and the other evil, exclaimed the disciples of Manes. No,
the two principles of universal equilibrium are not contrary, although contrasted
in appearance, for a singular wisdom opposes one to another. Good is on the right,
evil on the left; but the supreme excellence is above both, applying evil to the vic-
tory of good and good to the amendment of evil.
 The principle of harmony is in unity, and it is this which imparts such power to
the uneven number in Magic. Now, the most perfect of the odd numbers is three,
because it is the trilogy of unity. In the trigrams of Fohi, the superior triad is com-
posed of three YANG, or masculine figures, because nothing passive can be admit-
ted into the idea of God, considered as the principle of production in the three
worlds. For the same reason, the Christian Trinity by no means permits the per-
sonification of the mother, who is shown forth implicitly in that of the Son. For
the same reason, also, it is contrary to the laws of hieratic and orthodox symbol-
ogy to personify the Holy Ghost under the form of a woman. Woman comes forth
from man as Nature comes forth from God; so Christ Himself ascends to heaven
and assumes the Virgin Mother: we speak of the ascension of the Saviour, and the
assumption of the Mother of God. God, considered as Father, has Nature for His
daughter; as Son, He has the Virgin for His mother and the Church for His bride;
as Holy Spirit, He regenerates and fructifies humanity. Hence, in the trigrams of
Fohi, the three inferior YIN correspond to the three superior YANG, for these tri-
grams constitute a pantacle like that of the two triangles of Solomon, but with a
triadic interpretation of the six points of the blazing star.



--------------------------------------- 33

 THE TRIANGLE OF SOLOMON 15
 Dogma is only divine inasmuch as it is truly human – that is to say, in so far as 
it sums up the highest reason of humanity. So also the Master, Whom we term the 
Man-God, called Himself the Son of Man. Revelation is the expression of belief 
accepted and formulated by universal reason in the human word, on which 
account it is said that the divinity is human and the humanity divine in the Man- 
God., We affirm all this philosophically, not theologically, without infringing in 
any way on the teaching of the Church, which condemns and must always con- 
demn Magic. Paracelsus and Agrippa did not set up altar against altar but bowed 
to the ruling religion of their time: to the elect of science, the things of science; to 
the faithful, the things of faith. 
 In his hymn to the royal Sun, the Emperor Julian gives a theory of the triad 
which is almost identical with that of the illuminated Swedenborg. The sun of the 
divine world is the infinite, spiritual and uncreated light, which is verbalized, so 
to speak, in the philosophical world, and becomes the fountain of souls and of 
truth; then it incorporates and becomes visible light in the sun of the third world, 
the central sun of our suns, of which the fixed stars are the ever-living sparks. The 
Kabalists compare the spirit to a substance which remains fluid in the divine 
medium and under the influence of the essential light, its exterior, however, 
becoming solidified, like wax when exposed to air, in the colder realms of reason- 
ing or of visible forms. These shells, envelopes petrified or carnified, were such an 
expression possible, are the source of errors or of evil, which connects with the 
heaviness and hardness of animal envelopes. In the book Zohar, and in that of the 
Revolution of Souls, perverse spirits or evil demons are never called otherwise 
than shells – cortices. The cortices of the world of spirits are transparent, while 
those of the material world are opaque. Bodies are only temporary shells, whence 
souls have to be liberated; but those who in this life obey the flesh build up an 
interior body or fluidic shell, which, after death, becomes their prison-house and 
torment, until the time arrives when they succeed in dissolving it in the warmth of 
the divine light, towards which, however, the burden of their grossness hinders 
them from ascending. Indeed, they can do so only after infinite struggles, and by 
the mediation of the just, who stretch forth their hands towards them. During the 
whole period of the process they are devourd by the interior ae ctivity of the cap- 
tive spirit, as in a burning furnace. Th ose who attain the pyre of expiation burn 
themselves thereon, like Hercules upon Mount Oetna, and so are delivered from 
their sufferings; but the courage of the majority fails before this ordeal, which 
seems to them a second death more appalling than the first , and so they remain in 
hell, which is rightly and actually eternal; but souls are never precipitated nor 
even retained despite themselves therein. 



--------------------------------------- 34

16 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic 
 The three worlds correspond together by means of the thirty-two paths of light, 
which are as steps of a sacred ladder. Every true thought corresponds to a Divine 
Grace in heaven and a good work on earth; every Grace of God manifests a truth, 
and produces one or many acts; reciprocally, every act affects a truth or falsehood 
in the heavens, a grace or a punishment. When a man pronounces the Tetragram 
– say the Kabalists – the nine celestial realms sustain a shock, and then all spirits 
cry out one upon another: “Who is it thus disturbing the kingdom of heaven?” 
Then does the earth communicate unto the frst spheri e the sins of that rash being 
who takes the Eternal Name in vain, and the accusing word is transmitted from 
circle to circle, from star to star, and from hierarchy to hierarchy. 
 Every utterance possesses three senses, every act has a triple range, every form 
a triple idea, for the Absolute corresponds from world to world by its forms. Every 
determination of human will modifies Nature, concerns philosophy and is written 
in heaven. There are consequently two fatalities, one resulting from the Uncreated 
Will in harmony with its proper wisdom, the other from created wills in accor- 
dance with the necessity of secondary causes in their correspondence with the 
First Cause. There is hence nothing indifferent in life, and our seeming most sim- 
ple resolutions do often determine an incalculable series of benefits or evils, above 
all in the affinities of our DIAPHANE with the Great Magical Agent, as we shall 
explain elsewhere. 
 The triad, being the fundamental principle of the whole Kabalah, or Sacred 
Tradition of our fathers, was necessarily the fundamental dogma of Christianity, 
the apparent dualism of which it explains by the intervention of a harmonious 
and all-powerful unity. Chri st did not put His teaching into writing, and only 
revealed it in secret to His favoured disciple, the one Kabalist, and he a great 
Kabalist, among the apostles. So is the Apocalypse the book of the Gnosis or 
Secret Doctrine of the first Christians, and the key of this doctrine is indicated by 
an occult versicle of the Lord's Prayer, which the Vulgate leaves untranslated, 
while in the Greek Rite, which preserves the traditions of St. John, the priests only 
are permitted to pronounce it. This versicle, completely kabalistic, is found in the 
Greek text of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, and in several Hebrew copies, 
as follows: 
      .
 “The sacred word MALKUTH substituted for KETHER , which is its kabalistic 
correspondent, and the equipoise of GEBURAH and CHESED , repeating itself in the 
circles of heavens called eons by the Gnostics, provided the keystone of the whole 
Christian Temple in this occult versicle. It has been retained by Protestants in 
their New Testament, but they have failed to discern its lofty and wonderful 
meaning, which would have unveiled to them all the Mysteries of the Apocalypse. 



--------------------------------------- 35

 THE TRIANGLE OF SOLOMON 17
 There is, however, a tradition in the Church that the manifestation of these 
mysteries is reserved till the last times. 
 MALKUTH , based upon GEBURAH and CHESED , is the Temple of Solomon hav- 
ing JAKIN and BOAZ for its Pillars; it is Adamit e dogma, founded, for the one part 
on the resignation of Abel and, for the other, on the labours and self reproach of 
Cain; it is the equilibrium of being established on necessity and liberty, stability 
and motion; it is the demonstration of the universal lever sought in vain by 
Archimedes. A scholar whose talents were employed in the culture of obscurity, 
who died without seeking to be understood, resolved this supreme equation, dis- 
covered by him in the Kabalah, and was in dread of its source transpiring if he 
expressed himself more clearly. We have seen one of his disciples and admirers 
most indignant, perhaps in good faith, at the suggestion that his master was a 
Kabalist; but we can state notwithstanding, to the glory of the same learned man, 
that his researches have shortened appreciably our work on the occult sciences, 
and that the key of the transcendent Kabalah above all, indicated in the arcane 
versicle cited above, has been applied skillfully to an absolute reform of all sci- 
ences in the books of Hoene Wronski. 
 The secret virtue of the gospels is therefore contained in three words, and these 
three words have established three dogmas and three hierarchies. All science 
reposes upon three principles, as the syllogism upon three terms. There are also 
three distinct classes, or three original and natural ranks, among men, who are 
called to advance from the lower to the higher. The Jews term these three series or 
degrees in the progress of spirits, ASSIAH , YETZIRAH and BRIAH . The Gnostics, who 
were Christian Kabalists, called them HYLE , PSYCHE and GNOSIS ; by the Jews the 
supreme circle was named ATZILUTH , and by the Gnostics PLEROMA . In the Tetra- 
gram, the triad, taken at the beginning of the word, expresses the divine copula- 
tion; taken at the end, it expressed the female and maternity. Eve has a name of 
three letters, but the primitive Adam is signified simply by the letter JOD, whence 
Jehovah should be pronounced Jeva, and this point leads us to the great and 
supreme mystery of Magic, embodied in the tetrad.

tute a single law. Here, then, is the triad resumed in unity, and by adding the con-
ception of unity to that of the triad we are bought to the tetrad, the first square
and perfect number, the source of all numerical combinations and the principle of
all forms. Affirmation, negation, discussion, solution: such are the four philosoph-
ical operations of the human mind. Discussion conciliates negation with affirma-
tion by rendering them necessary to each other. In the same way, the philosophical
triad, emanating from the antagonism of th e duad, is completed by the tetrad, the
four-square basis of all truth. Accordin g to consecrated dogma, there are Three
Persons in God, and these Three constitute one only Deity. Three and one provide
the conception of four, because unity is required to explain the three. Hence, in
almost all languages, the name of God consists of four letters, and in Hebrew
these four are really three, one of them being repeated twice, that which expresses
the Word and the creation of the Word. 
 Two affirmations make two corresponding denials either possible or necessary.
The fact of being is affirmed, and that of nothingness is denied. Affirmation as
Word produces affirmation as realization or incarnation of the Word, and each of
these affirmations corresponds to the denial of its opposite. Thus, in the opinion
of the Kabalists, the name of the demon orof evil is composed of the same letters 
as the Name of God or goodness, but spelt backwards. This evil is the lost reflec-
tion or imperfect mirage of light in shadow. But all which exists, whether of good
or evil, of light or darkness, exists and manifests by the tetrad. The affirmation of
unity supposes the number four, unless it turns in unity itself as in a vicious circle.
So also the triad, as we have observed already, is explained by the duad and
resolved by the tetrad, which is the squared unity of even numbers and the qua-
drangular base of the cube, regarded as unity of construction, solidity and mea-
sure. 
 The Kabalistic Tetragram, JODHEVA , expresses God in humanity and humanity
in God. The four astronomical cardinal points are, relatively to us, the yea and the
nay of light – East and West – and the yea and nay of warmth – South and North.
As we have said already, according to the sole dogma of the Kabalah, that which
is in visible Nature reveals that which is in the domain of invisible Nature, or sec-
ondary causes are in strict proportion and analogous to the manifestations of the
First Cause. So is this First Cause reve aled invariably by the Cross – that unity
made up of two, divided one by the other in order to produce four; that key to the

mysteries of India and Egypt, The Tau of the patriarchs, the divine sign of Osiris, 
the Stauros of the Gnostics, the keystone of the temple, the symbol of Occult 
Masonry; the Cross, central point of the junction of the right angles of two infinite 
triangles; the Cross, which in the French language seems to be the first root and 
fundamental substantive of the verb to believe and the verb to grow, thus combin- 
ing the conceptions of science, religion and progress. 
 The Great Magical Agent manifests by four kinds of phenomena, and has been 
subjected to the experiments of profane science under four names – caloric, light, 
electricity, magnetism. It has received also the names of TETRAGRAM , INRI, 
AZOTH , ETHER , OD, Magnetic Fluid, Soul of the Earth, Lucifer, etc. The Great 
Magical Agent is the fourth emanation of the life-principle, of which the sun is the 
third form – see the initiates of the school of Alexandria and the dogma of Hermes 
Trismegistus. In this way the eye of the world, as the ancients called it, is the 
mirage of the reflection of God, and the soul of the earth is a permanent glance of 
the sun which the earth conceives and guards by impregnation. The moon con- 
curs in this impregnation of the earth by reflecting a solar image during the night, 
so that Hermes was right when he said of the Great Agent: “The sun is its father, 
the moon its mother.” Then he adds: “The wind has borne it in the belly thereof,” 
because the atmosphere is the recipient and, as it were, the crucible of the solar 
rays, by means of which there forms that living image of the sun which penetrates 
the whole earth, fructifies it and determines all that is produced on its surface by 
its emanations and permanent currents, analogous to those of the sun itself. This 
solar agent subsists by two contrary forces – one of attraction and one of projec- 
tion, whence Hermes says that it ascends and descends eternally. The force of 
attraction is always fixed at the centre of bodies, that of projection in their out- 
lines or at their surface. By this dual force all is created and all preserved. Its 
motion is a rolling up and an enrolling which are successive and unlimited, or, 
rather, Simultaneous and perpetual, by spirals of opposite movements which 
never meet. It is the same movement as that of the sun, at once attracting and 
repelling all the planets of its system. To be acquainted with the movement of this 
terrestrial sun in such a manner as to be able to apply its currents and direct 
them, is to have accomplished the Great Work and to be master of the world. 
Armed with such a force you may make yourself adored: the crowd will believe 
that you are God. 
 The absolute secret of this direction has been in the possession of certain men, 
and can yet be discovered. It is the Great Magical Arcanum, depending on an 
incommunicable axiom and on an instrument which is the grand and unique 
athanor of the highest grade of Hermetists. The incommunicable axiom is 
enclosed kabalistically in the four letters of the Tetragram, arranged in the 
following manner: 



--------------------------------------- 38

20 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
 In the letters of the words AZOTH and INRI written kabalistically; and in the
monogram of Christ as embroidered on the Labarum, which the Kabalist Postel
interprets by the word ROTA, whence the adepts have formed their Taro or Tarot,
by the repetition of the first letter, thus indicating the circle, and suggesting that
the word is read backwards. All magical science is comprised in the knowledge of
this secret. To know it and have the courage to use it is human omnipotence; to
reveal it to a profane person is to lose it; to reveal it even to a disciple is to abdi-
cate in favour of that disciple, who, henceforward, possesses the right of life and
death over his master – I am speaking from the magical standpoint – and will cer-
tainly slay him for fear of dying himself. But this has nothing in common with
deeds qualified as murder in criminal legislation; the practical philosophy which
is the basis and point of departure for our laws does not recognize the facts of
bewitchment and of occult influences. We touch here upon extraordinary revela-
tions, and are prepared for the unbelief and derision of incredulous fanaticism;
voltairean religion has also its fanatics, pace the great shades who must now be
lurking sullenly in the vaults of the Pantheon, while Catholicism, strong ever in its
practices and prestige, chants the Office overhead.
 The perfect word, that which is adequate to the thought which it expresses,
always contains virtually or supposes a tetrad: the idea, with its three necessary
and correlated forms, then the image of the thing expressed, with the three terms
of the judgement which qualifies it. When I say: “Being exists,” I affirm implicitly
that the void is nonexistent. A height, a breadth which the height subdivides lon-
gitudinally, a depth separated from the height by the intersection of the breadth,
such is the natural tetrad, composed of two lines at right angles one to another.
Nature has also four motions, products of two forces which sustain each other by
their tendency in an opposite direction. Now, the law whichrules bodies is analo- 
gous to that which governs minds, and that which governs minds is the very man-
ifestation of God's secret – that is to say, of the mystery of the creation. Imagine a
watch having two parallel springs, with an engagement which makes them work



--------------------------------------- 39

 THE TETRAGRAM 21
in an opposite direction so that the one in unwinding winds up the other. In this 
way, the watch will wind up itself, and you will have discovered perpetual motion. 
The engagement should be at two ends and of extreme accuracy. Is this beyond 
attainment? We think not. But when it is discovered the inventor will understand 
by analogy all the secrets of Nature PROGRESS IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO RESIS - 
TANCE The absolute movement of life is thus the perpetual consequence of two 
contrary tendencies which are never opposed. When one seems to yield to the 
other, it is like a spring which is winding up, and you may expect a reaction, the 
moment and characteristics of which it is quite possible to foresee and determine. 
Hence at the period of the greatest Christian fervour was the reign of ANTICHRIST 
known and predicted. But Antichrist will prepare and determine the Second 
Advent and final triumph of the Man-God. This again is a rigorous and kabalisti- 
cal conclusion contained in the Gospel premises. Hence the Christian prophecy 
comprises a fourfold revelation: I. Fall of the old world and triumph of the Gospel 
under the First Advent; 2. Great apostasy and coming of Antichrist; 3. Fall of 
Antichrist and recurrence to Christian ideas; 4. Definitive triumph of the Gospel, 
or Second Advent, designated under the name of the Last Judgement. This four- 
fold prophecy contains, as will be seen, two affirmations and two negations, the 
idea of two ruins or universal deaths and of two resurrections; for to every concep- 
tion which appears upon the social horizon an East and a West, a Zenith and a 
Nadir, may be ascribed without fear of error. Thus is the Philosophical Cross the 
key of prophecy, and all gates of science may be opened with the pantacle of 
Ezekiel, the centre of which is a star formed by the interlacement of two crosses. 
 Does not human life present itself also under these four phases or successive 
transformations – birth, life, death, immortality? And remark here that the 
immortality of the soul, necessitated as a complement of the tetrad, is kabalisti- 
cally proved by analogy, which is the sole dogma of truly universal religion, as it is 
the key of science and the universal law of Nature. As a fact, death can be no 
more an absolute end than birth is a real beginning. Birth proves the preexistence 
of the human being, since nothing is produced from nothing, and death proves 
immortality, since being can no more cease from being than nothingness can cease 
to be nothingness. Being and nothingness are two absolutely irreconcilable ideas, 
with this difference, that the idea of nothingness, which is altogether negative, 
issues from the very idea of being, whence even nothingness cannot be understood 
as an absolute negation, whilst the notion of being can never be put in comparison 
with that of nothingness, and still less can it come forth therefrom. To say that the 
world has been produced out of nothing is to advance a monstrous absurdity. All 
that is proceeds from what has been, and consequently nothing that is can ever 
more cease to be. The succession of forms is produced by the alternatives of move- 
ment; they are the phenomena of life which replace without destroying one 
another. All things change; nothing perishes. The sun does not die when it van-

 ishes from the horizon; even the most fluidic forms are immortal, subsisting
, e always in the permanence of their raison d'êtr which is the combination of light
 with the aggregated potencies of the molecules of the first substance. Hence they
 are preserved in the astral fluid, and can be evoked and reproduced according to
 the will of the sage, as we shall see when treating of second sight and the evoca-
 tion of memories in necromancy or other magical works. We shall return also to
 the Great Magical Agent in the fourth chapter of the Ritual, where we shall com-
 plete our indications of the characteristics of the Great Arcanum, and of the
 means of recovering this tremendous power.' 
 Here let us add a few words on the four magical elements and elementary spir-
 its. The magical elements are: in alchemy, Salt, Sulp hur, Mercury and Azoth; in
 Kabalah, the Macroprosopus, the Microprosopus and the two Mothers; in hiero-
 glyphics, the Man, Eagle, Li on and Bull; in old physics, according to vulgar names
 and notions, air, water, earth and fire. But in magical science we know that water
 is not ordinary water, fire is not simply fire, etc. These expressions conceal a more
 recondite meaning. Modern science has decomposed the four elements of the
 ancients and reduced them to a number of so-called simple bodies. That which is
 simple, however, is the primitive substance properly so-called; there is thus only
 one material element, which manifests always by the tetrad in its forms. We shall
 therefore preserve the wise distinction of elementary appearances admitted by the
 ancients, and shall recognize air, fire, earth and water as the four positive and vis-
 ible elements of Magic. 
 The subtle and the gross, the swift and slow solvent, or the instruments of heat
 and cold, constitute, in occult physics, the two positive and negative principles of
 the tetrad, and should be thus tabulated: 
 Thus, air and earth represent the male principle; fire and water are referable to
 the female principle, since the Philosophical Cross of pantacles, as affirmed
 already, is a primitive and elementary hieroglyph of the lingam of the gymnoso-
 phists. To these four elementary forms correspond the four following philosophi-
 cal ideas Spirit, Matter, Motion, Rest. As a fact, all science is comprised in the
 understanding of these four things, which alchemy has reduced to three – the
 Absolute, the Fixed and the Volatile – referred by the Kabalah to the essential idea
 of God, Who is absolute reason, necessity and liberty, a threefold notion expressed
 in the occult books of the Hebrews. Under the names of KETHER , CHOKMAH and
 BINAH for the Divine World; of TIPHERETH , CHESED and GEBURAH in the moral

 THE TETRAGRAM 23
world, and of JESOD , HOD and NETSAH in the physical world, which, together with 
the moral, is contained in the idea of the Kingdom or MALKUTH , we shall explain 
in the tenth chapter this theogony as rational as it is sublime. 
 Now, created spirits, being called to emancipation by trial, are placed from 
their birth between these four forces, two positive and two negative, and have it in 
their power to affirm or deny good, to choose life or death. To discover the fixed 
point, that is, the moral centre of the Cross, is the first problem which is given 
them to resolve; their initial conquest must be that of their own liberty. They 
begin by being drawn, some to the North, others to the South; some to the right, 
others to the left; and in so far as they are not free, they cannot have the use of 
reason, nor can they take flesh otherwise than in animal forms. These unemanci- 
pated spirits, slaves of the four elements, are those which the Kabalists call ele- 
mentary daimons, and they people the elements which correspond to their state of 
servitude. Sylphs, undines, gnomes and salamanders really exist therefore, some 
wandering and seeking incarnation, others incarnate and living on this earth. 
These are vicious and imperfect men. We shall return to this subject in the fif- 
teenth chapter, which treats of enchantments and demons. 
 That is also an occult tradition by which the ancients were led to admit the 
existence of four ages in the world, only it was not made known to the vulgar that 
these ages are successive and are renewed, like the four seasons of the year. Thus, 
the golden age has passed, and it is yet to come. This, however, belongs to the 
spirit of prophecy, and we shall speak of it in the ninth chapter, which is con- 
cerned with the initiate and the seer. If we now add the idea of unity to the tetrad, 
we shall have, together and separately, the conceptions of the divine synthesis and 
analysis, the god of the initiates and that of the profane. Here the doctrine 
becomes more popular, as it passes from the domain of the abstract: the grand 
hierophant intervenes.

 V x E
 THE PENT AGRAM
 GEBURAH ECCE
 HEREUNTO we have exposed the magical dogma in its more arid and abstruse
phases; now the enchantments begin; now we can proclaim wonders and reveal
most secret things. The Pentagram signifies the domination of the mind over the
elements, and the demons of air, the spirits of fire, the phantoms of water and
ghosts of earth are enchained by this sign. Equipped therewith, and suitably dis-
posed, you may behold the infinite through the medium of that faculty which is
like the soul's eye, and you will be ministered unto by legions of angels and hosts
of fiends. 
 But here, in the first place, let us establish certain principles. There is no invis-
ible world; there are, however, many degrees of perfection in organs. The body is
the coarse and, as it were, the perishable cortex of the soul. The soul can perceive
of itself, and independently of the mediation of physical organs, by means of its
sensibility and its DIAPHANE – the things, both spiritual and corporeal, which are
existent in the universe. Spiritual and corporeal are simply terms which express
the degrees of tenuity or density in substance. What is called the imagination
within us is only the soul's inherent faculty of assimilating the images and reflec-
tions contained in the living light, being the Great Magnetic Agent. Such images
and reflections are revelations when science intervenes to reveal us their body or
light. The man of genius differs from the dreamer and the fool in this only, that
his creations are analogous to truth, while those of the fool and the dreamer are
lost reflections and bewrayed images. Hence, for the wise man, to imagine is to
see, as, for the magician, to speak is to create. It follows that, by means of the
imagination, demons and spirits can be beheld really and in truth; but the imagi-
nation of the adept is diaphanous, whilst that of the crowd is opaque; the light of
truth traverses the one as ordinary light passes through clear glass, and is
refracted by the other, as when ordinary light impinges upon a vitreous block, full
of scoriae and foreign matter. That which most contributes to the errors of the
vulgar is the reflection of depraved imaginations one in the other. But in virtue of
positive science, the seer knows that what he imagines is true, and the event
invariably confirms his vision. We shall state in the Ritual after what manner this
lucidity can be acquired. 
 It is by means of this light that static visionaries place themselves in communi-
cation with all worlds, as so frequently occurred to Swedenborg, who notwith-
standing was imperfectly lucid, seeing that he did not distinguish reflections from
rays, and often intermingled chimerical fancies with his most admirable dreams.
24 



--------------------------------------- 43

 THE PENTAGRAM 25
We say dreams, because dream is the consequence of a natural and periodical 
ecstasy which we term sleep; to be in ecstasy is to sleep; magnetic somnambulism 
is a production and direction of ecstasy The err. ors which occur therein are occa- 
sioned by reflections from the DIAPHANE of waking persons, and, above all, of the 
magnetizer. Dream is vision produced by the refraction of a ray of truth. Chimeri- 
cal fantasy is hallucination occasioned by a reflection. The temptation of St. 
Anthony, with its nightmares and its monsters, represents the confusion of reflec- 
tions with direct rays. So long as the soul struggles it is reasonable; when it yields 
to this species of invading intoxication it becomes mad. To disentangle the direct 
ray, and separate it from the reflection – such is the work of the initiate. Here let 
us state distinctly that this work is being performed continually in the world by 
some of the flower of mankind; that there is hence a permanent revelation by 
intuition; and that there is no insuperable barrier which separates souls, because 
there are no sudden interruptions and no high walls in Nature by which minds 
can be divided from one another. All is transition and blending, wherefore, 
assuming the perfectibility, if not infinite at least indefinite, of human faculties, it 
will be understood that every person can attain to see all, and therefore to know 
all. There is no void in Nature: all is peopled. There is no true death in Nature: all 
is alive. “Seest thou that star?” asked Napoleon of Cardinal Fesch. “No, Sire.” “I 
see it,” said the Emperor, and he most certainly did. When great men are accused 
of superstition, it is because they behold what remains unseen by the crowd. Men 
of genius differ from simple seers by their faculty of communicating sensibly to 
others that which they themselves perceive, and of making themselves believed by 
the force of enthusiasm and sympathy. Such persons are the media of the Divine 
Word. 
 Let us now specify the manner in which visions operate. All forms correspond 
to ideas, and there is no idea which has not its proper and peculiar form. The pri- 
mordial light, which is the vehicle of all ideas, is the mother of all forms, and 
transmits them from emanation to emanation, merely diminished or modified 



--------------------------------------- 44

26 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
according to the density of the media. Secondary forms are reflections which
return to the font of the emanated light. The forms of objects, being a modifica-
tion of light, remain in the light where the reflection consigns them. Hence the
Astral Light, or terrestrial fluid, which we call the Great Magnetic Agent, is satu-
rated with all kinds of images or reflections. Now, our soul can evoke these, and
subject them to its DIAPHANE , as the Kabalists term it. Such images are always
present before us, and are effaced only by the more powerful impressions of real-
ity during waking hours, or by preoccupation of the mind, which makes our
imagination inattentive to the fluidic panorama of the Astral Light. When we
sleep, this spectacle presents itself spontaneously before us, and in this way
dreams are produced – dreams vague and incoherent if some governing will do
not remain active during the sleep, giving, even unconsciously to our intelligence,
a direction to the dream, which then transforms into vision. Animal Magnetism is
nothing but an artificial sleep produced by the voluntary or enforced union of two
wills, one of which is awake while the other slumbers – that is, one of which
directs the other in the choice of reflections for the transformation of dreams into
visions and the attainment of truth by means of images. Thus, somnambulists do
not actually travel to the place where they are sent by the magnetizer; they evoke
its images in the Astral Light and can behold nothing which does not exist in that
light. The Astral Light has a direct action on the nerves, which are its conductors
in the animal economy, transmitting it to the brain. It follows that, in a state of
somnambulism, it is possible to see by means of the nerves, without being depen-
dent on radiant light, the astral fluid being a latent light, in the same way that
physics recognize the existence of a latent caloric.
 Magnetism between two persons is certainly a wonderful discovery, but the
magnetizing of a person by himself, awakening his own lucidity and directing it
himself at will, is the perfection of magical art. The secret of this Great Work does
not remain for discovery; it has been known and practised by a great number of
initiates, above all by the celebrated Apollonius of Tyana, who has left a theory
concerning it, as we shall see in the “Ritual”. The secret of magnetic lucidity and
the direction of the phenomena of magnetism depend on two things – agreement
of minds and complete union of wills, in a direction which is possible and deter-
mined by science. This is for the operation of magnetism between two or more
persons. Solitary magnetism requires preparations of which we have spoken in,
our initial chapter, when enumerating and establishing in all their difficulty the
essential qualities of a veritable adept. In the following chapters we shall elucidate
further this importan t and fundamental point.
 The empire of will over the Astral Light, which is th e physical soul of the four
elements, is represented in Magic, by the Pentagram, placed at the head of this
chapter. 
 The elementary spirits are subservient to this sign when employed with under-

 THE PENTAGRAM 27
standing, and by placing it in the circle or on the table of evocations, they can be 
rendered tractable, which is magically called their imprisonment. Let us explain 
this marvel briefly. All created beings communicate with one another by signs, 
and all adhere to a certain number of truths expressed by determinate forms. The 
perfection of forms increases in proportion to the emancipation of spirits, and 
those that are not overweighted by the chains of matter, recognize by intuition out 
of hand whether a sign is the expression of a real power or of a precipitate will. 
The intelligence of the wise man therefore gives value to his pantacle, as science 
gives weight to his will, and spirits comprehend this power immediately. Thus, by 
means of the Pentagram, spirits can be forced to appear in vision, whether in the 
waking or sleeping state, BY THEMSELVES LEADING BEFORE OUR DIAPHANE THEIR 
REFLECTION, WHICH EXISTS IN THE A STRAL L IGHT, IF THEY HAVE LIVED, OR A 
REFLECTION ANALOGOUS TO THEIR SPIRITUAL LOGOS IF THEY HAVE NOT LIVED ON 
EARTH. This explains all visions, and accounts for the dead invariably appearing 
to seers, either such as they were upon earth, or such as they are in the grave, 
never as they subsist in a condition which escapes the perceptions of our actual 
organism. 
 Pregnant women are influenced more than others by the Astral Light, which 
concurs in the formation of the child, and offers them incessant reminiscences of 
the forms that abound therein. This explains how it is that women of the highest 
virtue deceive the malignity of observers by equivocal resemblances. On the fruit 
of their marriage they impress frequently an image which has struck them in 
dream, and it is thus that the same physiognomies are perpetuated from genera- 
tion to generation. The kabalistic usage of the Pentagram can determine therefore 
the appearance of unborn children, and an initiated woman might endow her son 
with the characteristics of Nero or Achilles, with those of Louis XIV or Napoleon. 
We shall indicate the method in our “Ritual”. 
 The Pentagram is called in Kabalah the Sign of the Microcosm, that sign so 
exalted by Goethe in the beautiful monologue of Faust: 
 “Ah, how do all my senses leap at this sight! I feel the young and sacred 
 pleasure of life quivering in my nerves and veins. Was it a God who traced 
 this sign which stills the vertigo of my soul, fills my poor heart with joy and, 
 in a mysterious rapture, unveils the forces of Nature around me? Am I 
 myself a God? All is so clear to me: I behold in these simple lines the revela- 
 tion of active Nature to my soul. I realise for the first time the truth of the 
 wise man's words: The world of spirits is not closed! Thy sense is obtuse, thy 
 heart is dead! Arise! Bath e, O adept of science, thy breast, still enveloped by 
 an earthly veil, in the splendours of the dawning day!” (Faust, Part i. sc. I.) 
 On 24 July in the year 1854, the author of this book, Eliphas Levi, made an 



--------------------------------------- 46

28 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
experiment of evocation with the Pentagram, after due preparation according to
all the Ceremonies indicated in the thirteenth chapter of the “Ritual”. The success
of this experiment, details of which, as regards its principles, will be found in the
corresponding chapter of the present doctrinal part, establishes a new pathologi-
cal fact, which men of true science will admit without difficulty. The experience,
repeated even to a third time, gave results truly extraordinary, but positive and
unmixed with hallucination. We invite sceptics to make a conscientious and intel-
ligent trial on their own part before shrugging their shoulders and smiling. The
figure of the Pentagram, completed in accordance with science and used by the
author in his experiment, is that which is found at the head of this chapter, and it
is more perfect than any in the Keys of Solomon or in the Magical Calendars of
Tycho Brahe and Duchentau. We must remark, however, that the use of the Pen-
tagram is most dangerous for operators who are not in possession of its complete
and perfect understanding. The direction of the points of the star is in no sense
arbitrary, and may change the entire character of an operation, as we shall
explain in the “Ritual”. 
 Paracelsus, that innovator in Magic, who surpassed all other initiates in his
unaided practical success, affirms that every magical figure and every kabalistic
sign of the pantacles which compel spirits, may be reduced to two, which are the
synthesis of all the others; these are the Sign of the Macrocosm or the Seal of
Solomon, the form of which we have given already, and that of the Microcosm,
more potent even than the first – that is t o say, t he Pentagram, of which he pro-
vides a most minute description in his occult philosophy. If it be asked how a sign
can exercise so much power over spirits, we inquire in return why the whole
Christian world bows down before that Sign of the Cross? The sign is nothing by
itself, and has no force apart from the doctrine of which it is the summary and the
logos. Now, a sign which summarizes, in their expression, all the occult forces of
Nature, a sign which has ever exhibited to elementary spirits and others a power
greater than their own, fills them naturally with respect and fear, enforcing their
obedience by the empire of science and of will over ignorance and weakness. By
the Pentagram also is measured the exact proportions of the great and unique
Athanor necessary to the confection of the Philosophical Stone and the accom-
plishment of the Great Work. The most perfect alembic in which the Quintessence
can be elaborated is conformable to this figure, and the Quintessence itself is rep-
resented by the Sign of the Pentagram.

 VI n F 
 MAGICAL EQUILIBRIUM 
 TIPHERETH UNCUS 
 SUPREME intelligence is necessarily reasonable. God, in philosophy, may be 
only a hypothesis, but He is a hypothesis imposed by good sense on human rea- 
son. To personify the Absolute Reason is to determine the Divine Ideal. Necessity, 
liberty and reason – these are the great and supreme triangle of the Kabalists, who 
name reason KETHER , necessity CHOKMAH , and liberty BINAH, in their first or 
Divine Triad. Fatality, will and power, such is the magical triad, which corre- 
sponds in things human to the Divine Triad. Fatality is the inevitable sequence of 
effects and causes in a determined order. Will is the directing faculty of intelligent 
forces for the conciliation of the liberty of persons with the necessity of things. 
Power is the wise application of will which enlists fatality itself in the accomplish- 
ment of the desires of the sage. When Moses smote the rock, he did not create the 
spring of water; he revealed it to the people, because occult science had made it 
known to himself by means of the divining rod. It is in like manner with all mira- 
cles of Magic; a law exists, which is ignored by the vulgar and made use of by the 
initiate. Occult laws are often opposed diametrically to common ideas. For exam- 
ple, the crowd believes in the sympathy of things which are alike and in the hostil- 
ity of things contrary, but it is the opposite which is the true law. It used to be 
affirmed that Nature abhors the void, but it should be said that Nature desires it, 
were the void not, in physics the most irrational of fict, ions. In all things the vul- 
gar mind habitually takes shadow for reality, turns its back upon light and is 
reflected in the obscurity which it projects itself. The forces of Nature are at the 
disposal of one who knows how to rest them. Arsi e you master sufficiently of 
yourself to be never intoxicated? Then will you direct the terrible and fatal power 
of intoxication. If you would make others drunk, possess them with the desire of 
drink, but do not partake of it yourself. That man will dispose of the love of oth- 
ers who is master of his own. If you would possess, do not give. The world is mag- 
netized by the light of the sun, and we are magnetized by the Astral Light of the 
world. That which operates in the body of the planet repeats itself in us. Within us 
there are three analogical and hierarchic worlds, as in all Nature. 
 Man is the Microcosm or little world, and, according to the doctrine of analo- 
gies, whatsoever is in the great world is reproduced in the small. Hence we have 
three centres of fluidic attraction and projection – the brain, the heart, or epigas- 
tric region, and the genital organ. Each of these instruments is one and twofold – 
in other words, we find the suggestion of the triad therein. Each attracts on one 
side and repels on the other. It is by means of such apparatus that we place our- 
 29

selves in communication with the universal fluid supplied to us by the nervous 
system. These three centres are, moreover,the seat of a triple magnetic operation,
as we shall explain elsewhere. When the Magus has attained lucidity, whether 
through the mediation of a pythoness or by his own development, he communi- 
cates and directs at will the magnetic vibrations in the whole mass of the Astral
Light, the currents of which he divines by means of the Magic Wand, which is a 
perfected divining rod. By the aid of these vibrations he influences the nervous
system of persons made subject to his action, accelerates or suspends the currents
of life, soothes or tortures, heals or hurts – in fine, slays or brings to life. …Here,
however, we pause in presence of the smile of incredulity. Let us permit it to enjoy
the easy triumph of denying what it does not know. 
 We shall demonstrate later on that death is preceded always by a lethargic 
sleep, and hence takes place gradually; that resurrec tion is possible in certain
cases; that lethargy is a real but uncompleted death; and that the final paroxysm
is in many cases subsequent to inhumation. This, however, is not the subject of 
the present chapter. We affirm now that a lucid will can act upon the mass of the
Astral Light, and in concurrence with other wills, which it absorbs and draws 
along, can determine great and irresistible currents. We say also that the Astral
Light condenses or rarefies in proportion as currents accumulate, more or less, at
certain Centres. When it is deficient in the energy required for the support of life,
diseases accompanied by sudden decomposition follow, of a kind which baffle 
physicians. There is no other cause, for example, in the case of cholera-morbus,
and the swarms of animalculae observed or supposed by some specialists may be 
the effect rather than the cause. 
 Cholera should be treated therefore by insufflation, did not the operator 
thereby run the chance of an exchange with the patient which would be very for- 
midable for himself. Every intelligent effort of will is a projection of the human
fluid or light, and here it is needful to distinguish the human from the Astral 
Light, and Animal from Universal Magnet ism. In making use of the word fluid, 
we employ an accepted exprssion, and seek to be underste ood in this manner, but
we are far from deciding that the latent light is a fluid. Everything prompts us, on
the contrary, to prefer the system of vibrations in the explanation of this phenom-
enal subject. However it may be, the light in question, being the instrument of 
life, cleaves naturally to all living centres, attaches itself to the nucleus of planets,
even as to the heart of man – and by the heart we understand magically the great
sympathetic – identifying itself with the individual life of the being which it ani-
mates, and it is by this quality of sympathetic assimilation that it is distributed
without confusion. Hence it is terrestrial in its affinity with the sphere of the earth
and human exclusively in its affinity with men. 
 It is for this reason that electricity, caloric, light and magnetism, produced by
ordinary physical means, not only do not originate, but tend rather to neutralize

 MAGICAL EQUILIBRIUM 31
the effects of Animal Magnetism. The Astral Light, subordinated to a blind mech- 
anism, and proceeding from arbitrary automatic centres, is a dead light and 
works mathematically, following given impulsions or fatal laws. The human light 
is fatal only to the ignorant, performing chance experiments; in the seer it is sub- 
jected to intelligence, submitted to imagination and dependent on will. This light, 
continually projected by the will, constitutes the personal atmospheres of Sweden- 
borg. The body absorbs what environs it and radiates perpetually by projecting its 
influences and invisible molecules; it is the same with the spirit, so that this phe- 
nomenon, by some mystics termed Respiration, has really the influence, both 
physical and moral, which is assigned to it. It is undoubtedly contagious to 
breathe the same air as diseased persons, and to be within the circle of attraction 
and expansion which surrounds the wicked. 
 When the magnetic atmosphere of two persons is so equilibrated that the 
attractive faculty of one draws the expansive faculty of the other, a tendency is 
produced which is termed sympathy; then imagination, calling up to it all the rays 
or reflections analogous to that which it experiences, makes a poem of the desires 
which captivate will, and if the persons differ in sex, it occasions in them, or more 
commonly in the weaker of the two, a complete intoxication of the Astral Light, 
which is termed passion par excellence, or love. Love is one of the great instru- 
ments of magical power, but it is categorically forbidden to the Magus, at least as 
an intoxication or passion. Woe to the Samson of the Kabalah if he permit himself 
to be put asleep by Delilah! The Hercules of science, who exchanges his royal 
sceptre for the distaff of Omphale, will soon experience the vengeance of Dejanira, 
and nothing will be left for him but the pyre of Mount Oetna, in order to escape 
the devouring folds of the coat of Nessus. Sexual love is ever an illusion, for it is 
the result of an imaginary mirage. The Astral Light is the universal seducer, typi- 
fied by the serpent of Genesis.' This subtle agent, ever active, ever vigorous, ever 
fruitful in alluring dreams a nd sensuous images; this force, which of itself is blind 
and subordinated to every will, whether for good or evil; this ever-renewing circu- 
lus of unbridled life, which produces vertigo in the imprudent; this corporeal 
spirit; this fiery body; this impalpable omnipresent ether; this monstrous seduc- 
tion of Nature – how shall we define it comprehensively and how characterize its 
action? To some extent indifferent in itself, it lends itself to good as to evil; it 
transmits light and propagat es darkness; it may be called equally Lucifer and 
Lucifuge; it is a serpent but it is also an aureole; it is a fire, but it may belong 
equally to the torments of infernus or the sacrifice of incense offered up to heaven. 
To dispose of it, we must, like the predestined woman, set our foot upon its head. 
 In the elementary world water corresponds to the kabalistic woman and fire to 
the serpent. To subdue the serpent, that is, to govern the circle of the Astral Light, 
we must place ourselves outside its currents: in other words, we must isolate our- 
selves. For this reason Apollonius of Tyana wrapped himself completely in a man-

tle of fine wool, setting his feet thereon and drawing it over his head. Then he
bent his back in semicircular fashion, and closed his eyes, after performing cer-
tain rites – probably magnetic passes and sacramental words, designed to fix
imagination and determine the action of will. The woollen mantle is of great use
in Magic and was the common conveyance of sorcerers on their way to the Sab-
bath, which proves that the sorcerers did not really go to the Sabbath, but the
Sabbath came to the sorcerers, when isolated in their mantle, and brought before
their TRANSLUCID images analogous to their magical preoccupations, combined
with reflections of all kindred acts accomplished previously in the world.
 This torrent of universal life is represented also in religious doctrines by the
expiatory fire of hell. It is the instrument of initiation, the monster to be over-
come, the enemy to subdue; it is this which brings to our evocations and to the
conjurations of Goetic Magic such swarms of larvae and phantoms. Therein are
preserved all the fantastic and fortuitous assemblages of forms which people our
nightmares with such abominable monstrosities. To be sucked down by this whirl-
ing stream is to fall into abysses of madness, more frightful than those of death; to
expel the shades of this chaos and compel it to give perfect forms to our thoughts
– this is to be a man of genius; it is to create, it is to be victorious over hell! The
Astral Light directs the instincts of anim als and offers battle to the intelligence of
man, which it strives to pervert by the enticements of its reflections and the illu-
sion of its images. It is a fatal and inevitable operation, directed and made still
more calamitous by elementary spirits and suffering souls, whose restless wills
seek out sympathies in our weakness and tempt us, but not so much to destroy us
as to win friends for themselves.
 That book of consciences which, according to Christian doctrine, shall be
opened at the last day, is no other than the Astral Light, which preserves the
impress of every logos, that is to say, of all actions and all forms. Our acts modify
our magnetic respiration in such a way that a seer, meeting any person for the
first time, can tell whether he is innocent or criminal, and what are his virtues or
his crimes. This faculty, which belongs to divination, was called by the Christian
mystics of the early Church the discernment of spirits.
 Those who abdicate the empire of reason and permit their wills to wander in
pursuit of reflections in the Astral Light, are subject to alternations of mania and
melancholy which have originated all the marvels of demoniacal possession,
though it is true, at the same time, that by means of these reflections impure spir-
its can act upon such souls, make use of them as docile instruments and even
habitually torment their or ganism, wherein they enter and reside by obsession, or
embryonically. These kabalistic terms are explained in the Hebrew book of the
Revolution of Souls, of which our thirteenth chapter will contain a succinct analy-
sis. It is therefore extremely dangerous to make sport of the Mysteries of Magic; it
is above all excessively rash to practise its rites from curiosity, by way of experi-

ment and as if to exploit higher forces. The inquisitive who, without being adepts, 
busy themselves with evocations or occult magnetism, are like children playing 
with fire in the neighbourhood of a cask of gunpowder; sooner or later they will 
fall victims to some terrible explosion. 
 To be isolated from the Astral Light it is not enough to envelop one's self in a 
woollen fabric; we must also, and above all, impose absolute tranquillity on mind 
and heart; we must have quitted the world of passions and be assured of persever- 
ance in the spontaneous operations of an inflexible will. We must reiterate fre- 
quently the acts of this will, for, as we shall see in the introduction to the “Ritual”, 
it is by acts only that confidence is assured to the will, as the power and perpetu- 
ity of religions depend on their Rites and Ceremonies. 
 There are intoxicating substances, which, by increasing nervous sensibility, 
exalt the power and consequently the allurements of astral representations; by the 
same means, but pursuing a contrary course, spirits may be terrified and dis- 
turbed. These substances, of themselves magnetic and magnetized further by 
operators, are what people term philtres and enchanted potions. But we shall not 
enter here upon this dangerous aspect of the practice, which Cornelius Agrippa 
himself terms venomous Magic. It is true that there are no longer pyres for sorcer- 
ers, but always, and more than ever, are there penalties dealt out to malefactors. 
Let us confine ourselves therefore to stating, as the occasion offers, the reality of 
such power. 
 To direct the Astral Light we must understand also its twofold vibration, as 
well as the balance of forces termed magical equilibrium, expressed in the 
Kabalah by the senary. Considered in its first cause, this equilibrium is the will of 
God; it is liberty in man and mathematical equilibrium in matter. Equilibrium 
produces stability and duration. Liberty generates the immortality of man,” and 
the will of God gives effect to the laws of Eternal Reason. Equilibrium in ideas is 
reason and in forces power. Equilibrium is exact; fulfil its law, and it is there; vio- 
late it, however slightly, and it is destroyed. For this reason nothing is useless or 
lost. Every utterance and every movement are for or against equilibrium, for or 
against truth, which is composed of for and against conciliated, or at least equili- 
brated. We shall state in the introduction to the “Ritual” how magical equilibrium 
should be produced, and why it is necessary to the success of all operations. 
 Omnipotence is the most absolute liberty; now, absolute liberty cannot exist 
apart from perfect equilibrium. Magical equilibrium is hence one of the first con- 
ditions of success in the operations of science, and must be sought even in occult 
chemistry, in learning to combine contraries without neutralizing them by one 
another. Magical equilibrium explains the great and primeval mystery of the 
existence and relative necessity of evil. This relative necessity gives, in Black 
Magic, the measure of the power of demons or impurespirits, to whom virtues 
practised upon earth are a source of increased rage and apparently of increased

power. At the epochs when saints and angels work miracles openly, sorcerers and
fiends in their turn operate marvels and prodigies. Rivalry often creates success;
we lean upon that which resists.

 THE FIER Y SWORD 
 NETSAH GLADIUS 
 THE septenary is the sacred number in all theogonies and in all symbols, 
because it is composed of the triad and the tetrad. The number seven represents 
magical power in all its fullness; it is the mind reinforced by all elementary poten- 
cies; it is the soul served by Nature; it is the SANCTUM REGNUM mentioned in the 
Keys of Solomon and represented in the Tarot by a crowned warrior, who bears a 
triangle on his cuirass and is posed upon a cube, to which two sphinxes are har- 
nessed, straining in opposite directions, while their heads are turned the same 
way. This warrior is armed with a fiery sword and holds in his left hand a sceptre 
surmounted by a triangle and a sphere. The cube is the Philosophical Stone; the 
sphinxes are the two forces of the Great Agent, corresponding to JAKIN and BOAZ, 
the two Pillars of the Temple; the cuirass is the knowledge of Divine Things, 
which renders the wise man invulnerable to human assaults; the sceptre is the 
Magic Wand; the fiery sword is the symbol of victory over the deadly sins, seven in 
number, like the virtues, the conceptions of both being typified by the ancients 
under the figures of the seven planets then known. Thus, faith – that aspiration 
towards the infinite, that noble self-reliance sustained by confidence in all virtues 
– the faith which in weak natures may degenerate into pride, was represented by 
the Sun; hope, the enemy of avarice, by the Moon; charity, in opposition to luxury, 
by Venus, the bright star of morning and evening; strength, superior to wrath, by 
Mars; prudence, hostile to idleness, by Mercury; temperance, opposed to gluttony, 
by Saturn, who was given a stone instead of his children to devour; finally, justice, 
in opposition to envy, by Jupiter, the conqueror of the Titans. Such are the sym- 
bols borrowed by astronomy from the Hellenic cultus. In the Kabalah of the 
Hebrews, the Sun represents the angel of light; the Moon, the angel of aspirations 
and dreams; Mars, the destroying angel; Venus, the angel of loves; Mercury, the 
angel of progress; Jupiter, the angel of power: Saturn, the angel of the wilderness. 
They were named also Michael, Gabriel, Samael, Anael, Raphael, Zachariel and 
Orifiel. 
 These governing potencies of souls shared human life during successive peri- 
ods, which astrologers measured by the revolutions of the corresponding planets. 
But kabalistic astrology must not be confounded with that which is called judicial. 
We will explain this distinction. Infancy is dedicated to the Sun, childhood to the 
Moon, youth to Mars and Venus, manhood to Mercury, ripe age to Jupiter, and old 
age to Saturn. Now, humanity in general subsists under laws of development anal- 
ogous to those of individual life. On this basis Trithemius esta blishes his prophetic

36 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
key of the seven spirits, to which we shall refer subsequently; by means thereof,
observing the analogical proportions of successive events, it is possible to predict
important future occurrences with certitude, and to fix beforehand, from age to
age, the destinies of nations and the world. St. John, depositary of the Secret Doc-
trine of Christ, has commemorated this sequence in the kabalistic book of the
Apocalypse, which he represents sealed with seven seals. We meet also the seven
genii of ancient mythologies, and the Cups and Swords of the Tarot. The doctrine
concealed under these emblems is pure Kabalah, already lost by the Pharisees at
the time of Christ's advent. The scenes which succeed one another in this wonder-
ful prophetic epic are so many pantacles, the keys of which are the ternary, the
quaternary, the septenary and the duodenary. Its hieroglyphic figures are analo-
gous to those of the Book of Hermes or the Genesis of Enoch, to make use of a
tentative title which expresses merely the personal opinion of the erudite William
Postel. 
 The cherub, or symbolic bull, which Moses placed at the gate of the Edenic
world, bearing a fiery sword, is a sphinx, having a bull's body and a human head;
it is the antique Assyrian sphinx, and the combat and victory of Mithras were its
hieroglyphic analysis. Now, this armed sphinx represents the Law of Mystery
which watches at the door of initiation to warn away the profane. Voltaire, who
knew nothing of all this, was highly divered at the notion of a bull brandishing at
sword. What would he have said had he visited the ruins of Memphis and Thebes,
and what would the echo of past ages which slumbers in the tombs of Rameses
have replied to those light sarcasms so much relished in France? The Mosaic
cherub represents also the Great Magical Mystery, of which the elements are
expressed by the septenary without, however, , giving the final word. This verbum
inenarrabile of the sages of the Alexandrian school, this word which Hebrew
Kabalists write 111 and interpret by ARARITA thus ex pressing the triplicity of the
secondary principle, the dualism of means, the equal unity of the first and final
principle, the alliance between the triad and the tetrad in a word composed of
four letters, which form seven by means of a triple and double repetition – this
word is pronounced ARARITA. 
 The virtue of the septenary is absolute in Magic, for this number is decisive in
all things: hence all religions have consecrated it in their rites. The seventh year
was a jubilee among the Jews; the seventh day is set apart for rest and prayer;
there are seven sacraments, etc. The seven colours of the prism and the seven
musical notes correspond also to the seven planets of the ancients, that is, to the
seven chords of the human lyre. The spiritual heaven has never changed, and
astrology has been more invariable than astronomy. The seven planets are, in fact,
the hieroglyphic symbols of the keyboard of our affections. To compose talismans
of the Sun, Moon or Saturn, is to attach the will magnetically to signs correspond-
ing to the chief powers of the soul; to consecrate something to Mercury or Venus is

to magnetize that object according to a direct intention, whether pleasure, science 
or profit be the end in view. The analogous metals, animals, plants and perfumes 
are auxiliaries to this end. The seven magical animals are: (a) Among birds, corre- 
sponding to the divine world, the swan, the owl, the vulture, the dove, the stork, 
the eagle and the pewit; (b) among fish, corresponding to the spiritual or scientific 
world, the seal, the catfish, the pike, the mullet, the chub, the dolphin, the sepia 
or cuttlefish; (c) among quadrupeds, corresponding to the natural world, the lion, 
the cat, the wolf, the he-goat, the monkey, the stag and the mole. The blood, fat, 
liver and gall of these animals serve in enchantments; their brain combines with 
the perfumes of the planets, and it is recognized by ancient practice that they pos- 
sess magnetic virtues corresponding to the seven planetary influences. 
 The talismans of the seven spirits are engraved either on precious stones, such 
as the carbuncle, crystal, diamond, emerald, agate, sapphire and onyx, or upon 
metals, such as gold, silver, iron, copper, fixed mercury, pewter and lead. The 
kabalistic signs of the seven spirits are: for the Sun, a serpent with the head of a 
lion; for the Moon, a globe divided by two crescents; for Mars, a dragon biting the 
hilt of a sword; for Venus, a lingam; for Mercury, the Hermetic caduceus and the 
cynocephalus; for Jupiter, the Blazing Pentagram in the talons or beak of an eagle; 
for Saturn, a lame and aged man, or a serpent curled about the sun-stone. All 
these symbols are found on engraved stones of the ancients and especially on 
those talismans of the Gnostic epochs which are known by the name of 
ABRAXAS. In the collection of the talismans of Paracelsus, Jupiter is represented 
by a priest in ecclesiastical garb, while in the Tarot he appears as a grand 
hierophant crowned with a triple tiara, holding a three-barred cross in his hands, 
forming the magical triangle, and representing at once the sceptre and key of the 
three worlds. 
 By collating all that has been said about the unity of the triad and tetrad, we 
shall find all that remains to be told concerning the septenary, that grand and 
complete magical unity composed of four and three.,

 REALIZA TION 
 HOD VIVENS 
 CAUSES manifest by effects, and effects are proportioned to causes. The Divine
Word, the One Word, the Tetragram, is self-affirmed by tetrad ic creation. Human
fecundity proves divine fecundity; the JOD of the Divine Name is the eternal viril-
ity of the First Principle. Man understands that he was made in the image of God
when he attains comprehension of God by increasing to infinity the idea which he
forms of himself. When realizing God asthe infinite man, man says unto himself:
I am the finite God. Magic differs from mysticism because it judges nothing a pri-
ori until after it has established a posteriori the actual base of its judgements, that
is to say, after having apprehended the cause by the effects contained in the
energy of the cause itself, by means of the universal law of analogy. Hence in the
occult sciences all is real, and theories are established only on the foundations of
experience. Realities alone constitute the proportions of the ideal, and the Magus
admits nothing as certain in the domain of ideas save that which is demonstrated
by realization. In other words, what is true in the cause manifests in the effect.
What is not realized does not exist. 
 The realization of speech is the logos properly so called. A thought is realized in
becoming speech; it is realized also by signs, sounds and representations of signs:
here is the first degree of realization. Then it is impr inted on the Astral Light by
means of the signs of writing or speech; it influences other minds by reflections
upon them; it is refracted by crossing the DIAPHANE of other men; it assumes new
forms and proportions; it is translated into acts and modifies the world: this is the
last degree of realization. Men who are born into a world modified by an idea bear
away with them the mark thereof, and it is thus that the word is made flesh. The
mark of the disobedience of Adam, preserved in the Astral Li ght, could be effaced
only by the stronger mark of the obedience of the Saviour, and thus the original
sin and redemption of the world can be explained in a natural and magical sense.
The Astral Light, or Soul of the World, was the instrument of Adam's omnipo-
tence; it became afterwards that of his punishment, being corrupted and troubled
by his sin, which intermingled an impure reflection with those primitive images
which composed the Book of Universal Science for his still virgin imagination.
 The Astral Light, depicted in ancient symbols by the serpent devouring its tail,
represents alternately malice and prudence, time and eternity, tempter and 
Redeemer; for this light, being the vehicle of life, is an auxiliary alike of good and
evil, and may be taken not only for the fiery form of Satan but for the body of the
Holy Ghost. It is the instrument of warfare in angelic battles, and feeds indiffer-

ently both the flames of hell and the lightnings of St. Michael. It may be compared 
to a horse having a nature analogous to the chameleon, ever reflecting the armour 
of his rider. The Astral Ligh t is the realization or form of intellectual light, as the 
latter is the realization or form of the Divine Light. 
 The Great Initiator of Christianity, se eing that the Astral Light was over- 
charged with the impure reflections of Roman debauchery, sought to separate His 
disciples from the circumambient sphere of reflections and to concentrate them 
only on the interior light, so that, through the medium of a common faith and 
enthusiasm, they might communicate together by new magnetic chains, which He 
termed grace, and thus overcome the dissolute currents, to which He gave the 
names of the devil and Satan, signifying their putrefaction. To oppose current to 
current is to renew the power of fluidic life. The revealers have therefore done 
scarcely more than divine, by the accuracy of their calculations, the appropriate 
moment for moral reactions. The law of realization produces what we call mag- 
netic breathing; places and objects become impregnated therewith, and this 
imparts to them an influence in conformity with our dominant desires, with those 
above all which are confirmed and realized by acts. As a fact, the Universal Agent, 
or latent Astral Light, ev er seeks equilibrium; it fills the void and draws in the 
plenitude, which makes vice contagious, like certain physical maladies, and works 
powerfully in the proselytism of virtue. Hence it is that cohabitation with antipa- 
thetic beings is a torment; hence it is that relics, whether of saints or of great crim- 
inals, produce extraordinary results in sudden conversion and perversion; hence it 
is that sexual love is often awakened by a breath or a touch, and this not only by 
means of contact with the person himself, but with objects which he has uncon- 
sciously touched or magnetized. 
 There is an outbreathing and inbreathing of the soul, exactly like that of the 
body. Whatsoever it regards as felicity, that it inhales, and it breathes forth ideas 
which result from its inner sensations. Diseased souls have an evil breath and viti- 
ate their moral atmosphere – that is, they combine impure reflections with the 
Astral Light which permeat es them and establish unwholesome currents therein. 
We are often assailed, to our astonishment, in society by evil thoughts which 
would have seemed antecedently impossible and are not aware that they are due 
to some morbid proximity. This secret is of high importance, for it leads to the 
unveiling of consciences, one of the most incontestible and terrible powers of 
Magical Art. Magnetic respiration produces about the soul a radiation of which it 
is the centre, and thus surrounds it with the reflection of its own works, creating 
for it a heaven or hell. There are no isolated acts, and it is impossible that there 
should be secret acts; whatsoever we will truly, that is, everything which we con- 
firm by our acts, remains registered in the Astral Light, wh ere our reflections are 
preserved. These reflections influence our thought continually by the mediation of 
the DIAPHANE , and it is in this sense that we become and remain the children of

our works. 
 The Astral Light, transformed at the moment of conception into human light,
is the soul's first envelope, and, in combination with extremely subtle fluids, it
forms the Ethereal Body or Sidereal Phantom, of which Paracelsus discourses in
his philosophy of intuition – philosophia sagax.
 This sidereal body, being liberated at death, attrac ts and for a long time pre-
serves, through the sympathy of things homogeneous, the reflections of the past
life; if drawn into a special current by a will which is powerfully sympathetic, it
manifests naturally, for there is nothing more natural than prodigies. It is thus
apparitions are produced. But we shall develop this point more fully in a chapter
devoted to Necromancy. The fluidic body, subject, like the mass of the Astral
Light, to two contrary mov ements, attracting on the left and repelling on the
right, or reciprocally, between the two sexes, begets various impulses within us,
and contributes to solicitudes of conscience; it is influenced frequently by reflec-
tions of other minds, and thus temptations are produced on the one hand, and on
the other profound and unexpected graces. The traditional doctrine of two angels
who sustain and tempt us is explained in this manner. The two forces of the Astral
Light may be represented by a balance wherein are weighed our good intentions
for the triumph of justice and the emancipation of our liberty.
 The Astral Body is not always of the same sex as the terrestrial, that is, the pro-
portions of the two forces, varying from right to left, seem frequently to belie the
visible organization, producing seeming aberrations of human passion and
explaining, while in no wise morally justifying, the amorous peculiarities of Ana-
creon or Sappho. A skilful magnetizer should take all these subtle distinctions into
account, and we shall provide in our “Ritual” the rules for their recognition.
 There are two kinds of realization, the true and the fantastic. The first is the
exclusive secret of magicians, the other belongs to enchanters and sorcerers.
Mythologies are fantastic realizations of religious dogma; superstitions are the sor-
cery of mistaken piety; but even mythologies and superstitions are more effica-
cious on human will than a purely speculative philosophy apart from any
practice. Hence St. Paul opposes the conquests of the folly of the Cross to the
inertness of human wisdom. Religion realizes philosophy by adapting it to the
weaknesses of the vulgar; such is for Kabalists the secret reason and occult expla-
nation of the doctrines of incarnation and redemption.
 Thoughts untranslated into speech are thoughts lost for humanity; words
unconfirmed by acts are idle words, and the idle word is not far removed from
falsehood. Thought formulated by speech and confirmed by acts constitutes a
good work or a crime. Hence, whether in vice or virtue, there is no utterance for
which we are not responsible; above all, there are no indifferent acts. Curses and
blessings produce their consequence invariably, and every action, whatsoever its
nature, whether inspired by love or hate, has effects analogous to its motive, its

extent and its direction. When that emperor whose images had been mutilated, 
raising his hand to his face, exclaimed, “I do not feel that I am injured,” he was 
mistaken in his valuation and detracted thereby from the merit of his clemency. 
What man of honour could behold undisturbed an insult offered to his portrait? 
 And did such insults, inflicted even unknown to ourselves, react on us by a 
fatal influence, were the effects of bewitchment actual, as indeed an adept cannot 
doubt, how much more imprudent and ill-advised would seem this utterance of 
the good emperor! 
 There are persons whom we can never offend with impunity, and if the injury 
we have done them is mortal, we begin forthwith to die. There are those also 
whom we never meet in vain, whose mere glance alters the direction of our life. 
The basilisk who slays by a look is no fable; it is a magical allegory. Generally 
speaking, it is bad for health to have enemies, and we can never brave with impu- 
nity the reprobation of anyone. Before opposing ourselves to a given force or cur- 
rent, we must be well assured that we possess the contrary force, or are with the 
stream of the contrary current; otherwise, we shall be crushed or struck down, 
and many sudden deaths have no other cause than this. The terrible visitations of 
Nadab and Abihu, of Osa, of Ananias and Sapphira, were occasioned by electric 
currents of outraged convictions; the sufferings of the Ursulines of Loudun, the 
nuns of Louviers and the convulsionaries of Jansenism, were identical in principle 
and are explicable by the same occult natural laws. Had not Urban Grandier been 
immolated, one of two things would have occurred: either the possessed nuns 
would have died in frightful convulsions or the phenomena of diabolical frenzy 
would have so gained in strength and influence, epidemically, that Grandier, not- 
withstanding his knowledge and his reason, would also have become hallucinated, 
and to such a degree that he would have denounced himself, like the unhappy 
Gaufridy, or would otherwise have perished suddenly, with all the appalling char- 
acteristics of poisoning or of divine vengeance. In the eighteenth century the 
unfortunate poet Gilbert fell a victim to his audacity in braving the current of 
opinion and even of philosophical fanaticism which characterized his epoch. 
Guilty of philosophical treason, he died raving mad, possessed by the most 
incredible terrors, as if God Himself had punished him for defending His cause 
out of season. As a fact, he perished by reason of a law of Nature of which assur- 
edly he knew nothing; he set himself against an electric current and was struck 
down as by lightning. Had Marat not been assassinated by Charlotte Corday, he 
would have been destroyed infallibly by a reaction of public feeling. It was the 
execration of decent people which afflicted him with leprosy, and he would have 
had to succumb thereto. The reprobation excited by the massacre of St. Bartho- 
lomew was the sole cause of the atrocious disease and death of Charles IX, while, 
had not Henry IV been sustained by an immense popularity, which he owed to the 
projecting power of sympathetic force of his astral life, he would scarcely have

outlived his conversion, but would have perished under the contempt of Protes-
tants, combined with the suspicion and ill-will of Catholics. Unpopularity may be
a proof of integrity and courage, but never of policy or prudence: the wounds
inflicted by opinion are mortal for statesmen. We may recall the premature and
violent end of many illustrious persons whom it would be inexpedient to mention
here. The brandings of public opinion may be often great injustices, but none the
less they condemn their victims to failure and are often a death-sentence. On the
other hand, acts of injustice done to a single individual can and should, if
unatoned, cause the ruin of an entire nation or of a whole society: this is what is
called the cry of blood, for at the root of every injustice there is the germ of homi-
cide. By reason of these terrible laws of solidarity, Christianity recommends so
strongly the forgiveness of injuries and reconciliation. He who dies unforgiving
casts himself dagger-armed into eternity and condemns himself to the horrors of
an eternal murder. The efficacy of paternal or maternal blessings or curses is an
invincible popular tradition and belief. As a fact, the closer the bonds which unite
two persons, the more terrible are the consequences of hatred between them. The
brand of Althaea consuming the life of Meleager is the mythological symbol of this
terrible power. Let parents be ever on their guard, for no one can kindle hell in his
own blood, or devote his own issue to misfortune, without being himself burnt
and made wretched. To pardon is never a crime, but to curse is always a danger
and an evil action.

 IX t I 
 INIT IA TION 
 JESOD BONUM 
 THE INITIATE is he who possesses the lamp of Trismegistus, the mantle of Apol- 
lonius, and the staff of the patriarchs. The lamp of Trismegistus is reason illumi- 
nated by science; the mantle of Apollonius is full and complete self-possession, 
which isolates the sage from blind tendencies; and the staff of the patriarchs is the 
help of the secret and everlasting focesr of Nature. The lamp of Trismegistus 
enlightens present, past and future, lays bare the conscience of men and manifests 
the inmost recesses of the female heart. The lamp burns with a triple flame, the 
mantle is thrice-folded and the staff is divided into three parts. 
 The number nine is that of divine reflections; it expresses the divine idea in all 
its abstract power, but it signifies also extravagance in belief, and hence supersti- 
tion and idolatry. For this reason Hermes made it the number of initiation, 
because the initiate reigns over superstition and by superstition: he alone can 
advance through the darkness, leaning on his staff, enveloped in his mantle and 
lighted by his lamp. Reason has been given to all men, but all do not know how to 
make use of it: it is a science to be acquired. Liberty is offered to all, but not all 
can be free: it is a right that must be earned. Force is for all, but all do not know 
how to rest upon it: it is a power that must be won. We attain nothing without 
more than one effort. The destiny of man is to be enriched by his own earning and 
afterwards to have, like God, the glory and pleasure of dispensing it. 
 Magic was called formerly the Sacerdotal Art and the R oyal Art, because initia- 
tion gave empire over souls to the sage and the capacity for ruling wills. Divina- 
tion is also one of the privileges of the initiate; now, divination is simply the 
knowledge of effects contained in causes and science applied to the facts of the 
universal dogma of analogy. Human acts are not written in the Astral Light alone; 
their traces are left upon the face, they modify mien and carriage, they change the 
tone of the voice. Thus every man bears about him the history of his life, which is 
legible for the initiate. Now, the future is ever the consequence of the past, and 
unexpected circumstances do not appreciably alter results reasonably calculated. 
The destiny of each man can be therefore foretold him. An entire existence may be 
judged by a single movement; a single oddity or weakness may be the presage of a 
long chain of misfortunes. Caesar was assassinated because he was ashamed of 
being bald; Napoleon endedhis days at St. Heleua be cause he admired the poems 
of Ossian; Louis Philippe abdicated the throne as he did because he carried an 
umbrella. These are paradoxes for the vulgar, who cannot grasp the occult rela- 
tions of things, but they are causes for the adept, who understands all and is sur- 
 43



--------------------------------------- 62

44 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic 
prised at nothing. 
 Initiation is a preservative against the false lights of mysticism; it equips 
human reason with its relative value and proportional infallibility, connecting it 
with supreme reason by the chain of analogies. Hence the initiate knows no 
doubtful hopes, no absurd fears, because he has no irrational beliefs; he is 
acquainted with the extent of his power,and he can be bold without danger . For
him, therefore, to dare is to be able. Here, then, is a new interpretation of his 
attributes: his lamp represents learning; the mantle which enwraps him, his dis- 
cretion; while his staff is the emblem of his strength and boldness. He knows, he 
dares and is silent. He knows the secrets of the future, he dares in the present, and 
he is silent on the past. He knows the failings of the human heart; he dares make 
use of them to achieve his work; and he is silent as to his purposes. He knows the 
significance of all symbolisms and of all religions; he dares to practise or abstain 
from them without hypocrisy and without impiety; and he is silent upon the one 
dogma of supreme initiation. He knows the existence and nature of the Great 
Magical Agent; he dares perform the acts and give utterance to the words which 
make it subject to human will, and he is silent upon the mysteries of the Great 
Arcanum. 
 So may you find him often melancholy, never dejected or despairing; often 
poor, never abject or miserable; persecuted often, never disheartened or con- 
quered. He remembers the bereavement and murder of Orpheus, the exile and 
lonely death of Moses, the martyrdom of the prophets, the tortures of Apollonius, 
the Cross of the Saviour. He knows the desolation in which Agrippa died, whose 
memory is even now slandered; he knows what labours overcame the great 
Paracelsus, and all that R aymond Lully was condemned to undergo that he might 
finish by a violent death. He remembers Swedenborg simulating madness and 
even losing reason in order to excuse his science; Saint-Martin and his hidden life; 
Cagliostro, who perished forsaken in the cells of the Inquisition; Cazotte, who 
ascended the scaffold. Inheritor of so many victims, he does not dare the less, but 
he understands better the necessity for silence. Let us follow his example; let us 
learn diligently; when we know, let us have courage, and let us be silent.

 X v K 
 THE KABALAH 
 MALKUTH PRINCIPIUM PHALLUS 
ALL religions have preserved the remembrance of a primitive book, written in 
hieroglyphs by the sages of the earliest epoch of the world. Simplified and vulgar- 
ized in later days, its symbols furnished letters to the art of writing, characters to 
the Word, and to occult philosophy its mysterious signs and pantacles. This book, 
attributed by the Hebrews to Enoch, seventh master of the world after Adam; by 
the Egyptians to Hermes Trismegistus; by the Greeks to Cadmus, the mysterious 
builder of the Holy City: this book was the symbolical summary of primitive tra- 
dition, called subsequently Kabalah or Cabala, meaning reception. The tradition 
in question rests altogether on the one dogma of Magic: the visible is for us the 
proportional measure of the invisible. Now the ancients, observing that equilib- 
rium is the universal law in physics, and is consequent on the apparent opposition 
of two forces, argued from physical to metaphysical equilibrium, and maintained 
that in God, that is, in the First Livi ng and Active Cause, there must be recog- 
nized two properties which are necessary one to another – stability and motion, 
necessity and liberty, rational order and volitional autonomy, justice and love, 
whence also severity and mercy. And these two attributes were personified, so to 
speak, by the kabalistic Jews under the names of GEBURAH and CHESED . Above 
GEBURAH and CHESED abides the Supreme Crown, the equilibrating power, prin- 
ciple of the world or equilibrated kingdom, which we find mentioned under the 
name of MALKUTH in the occult and kabalistic versicle of the Paternoster to which 
we have already referred. But GEBURAH and CHESED , maintained in equilibrium 
by the Crown above and the KINGDOM below, constitute two principles, which 
may be considered either from an abstract point of view or in their realization. In 
their abstract or idea lized sense, they take the higher names of CHOKMAH , Wis- 
dom, and BINAH , Intelligence. Their realization is stability and progress, that is, 
eternity and victory – HOD and NETSAH . 
 Such, according to the Kabalah, is the groundwork of all religions and all sci- 
ences – a triple triangle and a circle, the notion of the triad explained by the bal- 
ance multiplied by itself in the domains of the ideal, then the realization of this 
conception in forms. Now, the ancients attached the first notions of this simple 
and impressive theology to the very idea of numbers, and qualified the figure of 
the first decade after the following manner: 
 1. KETHER . -- The Crown, the equilibrating power. 
 2. CHOKMAH .-Wisdom, equilibrated in its unchangeable order by the initiative 
 45



--------------------------------------- 64

46 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
of intelligence. 
 3. BINAH.-Active Intelligence, equilibrated by Wisdom.
 4. CHESED .-Mercy, which is Wisdom in its secondary conception, ever benevo-
lent because it is strong. 
 5. GEBURAH .-Severity, necessitated by Wisdom itself, and by goodwill. To per-
mit evil is to hinder good.
 6. TIPHERETH .-Beauty, the luminous conception of equilibrium in forms, inter-
mediary between the Crown and the Kingdom, mediating principle between Cre-
ator and creation – a sublime conception of poetry and its sovereign priesthood!
 7. NETSAH . - Victory, that is, eternal triu mph of intelligence and justice.
 8. HOD.-Eternity of the conquests achieved by mind over matter, active over
passive, life over death. 
 9. JESOD . The Foundation, that is, the basis of all belief and all truth otherwise,
the ABSOLUTE in philosophy.
 10. MALKUTH .-The Kingdom, meaning the universe, entire creation, the work
and mirror of God, the proof of supreme reason, the formal consequence which
compels us to have recourse to virtual premises, the enigma which has God for its
answer – that is to say, Supreme and Absolute Reason.
 These ten primary notions attached to the ten first characters of the primitive
alphabet, signifying both principles and numbers, are called the ten SEPHIROTH
by the masters in Kabalah. The Sacred Tetragram, drawn in the following man-
ner, indicates the number, source and correspondence of Divine Names. To this
name of JOTCHAVAH , written by these four-and-twenty signs, crowned with a triple
flower of light, must be referred the twenty-four thrones of heaven and the
twenty-four crowned elders in the Apocalypse. In the Kabalah the occult principle
is called the Ancient, and this principle, multiplied and, as it were, reflected in
secondary causes, creates images of itself – that is to say, so many Ancients as
there are diverse conceptions of its unique essence. These images, less perfect in
proportion as they are removed farther from their source, project upon the dark-
ness an ultimate reflection or glimmer, representing a horrible and deformed
Ancient, who is termed vulgarly the devil. Hence an initiate has been bold enough
to say: “The devil is God, as understood by the wicked”; while another has added,
in words more bizarre but no less energetic: “The devil is composed of God's
ruins.” We may sum up and explain these strikingly novel definitions by remark-



--------------------------------------- 65

 THE KABALAH 47
ing that in symbolism itself the demon is an angel cast out of heaven for having 
sought to usurp divinity. This belongs to the allegorical language of prophets and 
makers of legends. Philosophically speaking, the devil is a human idea of divinity, 
which has been surpassed and dispossessed of heaven by the progress of science 
and reason. Among primitive Oriental peoples, Moloch, Adramelek, Baal, were 
personifications of the one God, dishonoured by barbarous attributes. The god of 
the Jansenists, creating hell for the majority of human beings and delighting in 
the eternal tortures of those he was unwilling to save, is a conception even more 
barbarous than that of Moloch: hence the god of the Jansenists is already a verita- 
ble Satan, fallen from heaven, in the sight of every wise and enlightened Chris- 
tian. 
 In the multiplication of the Divine Names the Kabalists have connected them 
all, either with the unity of the Tetragram, the figure of the triad, or the sephirotic 
scale of the decad. They arrange the scale of the Divine Names and numbers in a 
triangle, which may be presented in Roman characters as follows: 
 J 
 JA 
 SDI 
 JEHV 
 ELOIM 
 SABAOT 
 ARARITA 
 ELVEDAAT 
 ELIM GIBOR 
 ELIM SABAOT 
 The sum of all these Divine Names formed from the one Tetragram, but outside 
the Tetragram itself, is a basis of the Hebrew Ritual and constitutes the occult 
force which the kabalistic rabbins invoke under the title ofShemhamphor as. 
 We have now to concern ourselves with the Tarot from the kabalistic point of 
view, and have already indicated the occult source of the name. This hieroglyphic 
book is composed of a kabalistic alphabet and of a wheel or circle of four decades, 
distinguished by four symbolical and typical figures, each having for its radius a 
scale of four progressive figures, which represent Humanity: man, woman, youth, 
child – master, mistress, knight, esquire. The twenty-two figures of the alphabet 
represent, in the first place, the thirteen dogmas, and secondly the nine beliefs, 
authorized by that Jewish religion which is so strong and so firmly established on 
highest reason. 
 Here follows the religious and kabalistic key of The Tarot, formulated in tech- 
nical verses after the mode of the ancient lawgivers: 



--------------------------------------- 66

48 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
 1 ' A Conscious, Active Cause in all we see,
 2 h And number proves the living unity.
 3 g No bound hath He who doth the whole contain,
 4 o But, all preceding, fills life's vast domain.
 5 x Sole worthy worship, He, the only Lord,
 6 n Doth His true doctrine to clean hearts accord.
 7 z But since faith's works a single pontiff need,
 8 k One law have we, and at one altar plead;
 9 t Eternal God for aye their base upholds.
 10 v Heaven and man's day alike His rule enfolds.
 11 [ In mercy rich, in retribution strong,
 12 s His people's King He will upraise ere long.
 13 a The tomb gives entrance to the promised land,
 Death only ends; life's vistas still expand.
 These doctrines sacred, pure and steadfast shine;
 And thus we close our number's scale divine.
 14 i Good angels all things temper and assuage,
 15 y While evil spirits burst with wrath and rage.
 16 r God doth the lightning rule, the flame subdue.
 17 q His word controls both Vesper and her dew.
 18 , He makes the moon our watchman through the night,
 19 f And by His sun renews the world in light.
 20 w When dust to dust returns, His breath can call
 20 
 or } e Life from the tomb which is the fate of all.
 21 
 21 
 or } b His crown illuminates the mercy seat,
 22 
 And glorifies the cherubs at His feet.
 By the help of this purely dogmatic explanation we shall already understand
the kabalistic alphabet of the Tarot. Thus , Figure I, entitled the Juggler, repre-
sents the active principle in the economy of divine and human autotelia. Figure II,
vulgarly called Pope Joan, represents dogmatic unity based upon numbers, and is
the personification of the Kabalah or the Gnosis. Figure III represents Divine Spir-
ituality under the emblem of a winged woman, holding in one hand the apocalyp-
tic eagle, and in the other the world suspended from the end of her sceptre. The
other emblems are equally clear, and can be explained as easily as the first. Turn-



--------------------------------------- 67

 THE KABALAH 49
ing now to the four suits, namely, Clubs, Cups, Swords, and Circles or Pantacles, 
commonly called Deniers – all these are hieroglyphics of the Tetragram. Thus, the 
Club is the Egyptian Phallus or Hebrew JOD; the Cup is the cteis or primitive HE ; 
the Sword is the conjunction of both, or the lingam, represented in Hebrew pre- 
ceding the captivity by Vau while the Circle or Pantacle, image of the world, is the 
HE final of the Divine Name. Now let us take a Tarot and combine all its emblems 
one by one into the Wheel or Rota of William Postel; let us group the four aces, 
the four twos, and so on, together; we shall then have ten packs of cards giving 
the hieroglyphic interpretation of the triangle of Divine Names on the scale of the 
denary, as previously tabulated. By referring each number to its corresponding 
SEPHIRA, we may then read them off as follows: 
 xnxv 
 Four signs present the Name of every name. 
 1 KETHER . 
 The four Aces. 
 Four brilliant beams ad orn His crown of flame. 
 2 CHOKMAH . 
 The four Twos. 
 Four rivers ever from His wisdom flow. 
 3 BINAH. 
 The four Threes. 
 Four proofs of His intelligence we know. 
 4 CHESED . 
 The four Fours. 
 Four benefactions from His mercy come. 
 5 GEBURAH . 
 The four Fives. 
 Four times four sins avenged His justice sum. 
 6 TIPHERETH . 
 The four Sixes. 
 Four rays unclouded make His beauty known. 



--------------------------------------- 68

50 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
 7 NETSAH .
 The four Sevens.
 Four times His conquest shall in song be shown.
 8 HOD.
 The four Eights.
 Four times He triumphs on the timeless plane.
 9 JESOD.
 The four Nines.
 Foundations four His great white throne maintain.
 10 MALKUTH .
 The four Tens.
 One fourfold kingdom owns His endless sway,
 As from His crown there streams a fourfold ray.
 By this simple arrangement the kabalistic meaning of each card is exhibited.
For example, the five of Clubs signifies rigorously GEBURAH of JOD, that is, the
justice of the Creator or the wrath of man; the seven of Cups signifies the victory
of mercy or the triumph of woman; the eight of Swords signifies conflict or eternal
equilibrium; and so of the others. We can thus understand how the ancient pon-
tiffs proceeded to make the oracle speak. The chance dealing of the laminae pro-
duced invariably a fresh kabalistic meaning, exactly true in its combinations,
which alone were fortuitous; and, seeing that the faith of the ancients attributed
nothing to chance, they read the answers of Providence in the oracles of the Tarot,
which were called THERAPH or THERAPHIM by the Hebrews, as the erudite Kaba-
list Gaffarel, one of the magicians employed by Cardinal Richelieu, was the first
to perceive. 
 As to the Court-cards, a final couplet will suffice to explain them:
 KING, QUEEN , KNIGHT, ESQUIRE .
 The married pair, the youth, the child, the race; 
 Thy path by these to Unity retrace.
 At the end of the “Ritual” we shall provide further details, together with full
documents, concerning the marvellous Book of the Tarot, of all books the most
primitive, the key of prophecies and dogmas, in a word, the inspiration of inspired
works, a fact which has remained unperceived, not only by the science of Court de
Gebelin but by the extraordinary intuitions of Etteilla or Alliette.



--------------------------------------- 69

 THE KABALAH 51
 The ten SEPHIROTH and the twenty-two Tarots form what the Kabalists term 
the thirty-two paths of absolute science. With regard to particular sciences, they 
distinguish them into fifty chapters, which they call the fifty gates: among Orien- 
tals the word gate signifies government or authority. The rabbins also divided the 
Kabalah into BERESHITH , or universal Genesis, and MERCAVAH , or the Chariot of 
Ezekiel; then by means of a dual interpretation of the kabalistic alphabets, they 
formed two sciences, called GEMATRIA and TEMURAH , and so composed the 
Notary Art, which is fundamentally the complete science of the Tarot signs and 
their complex and varied application to the divination of all secrets, whether of 
philosophy, Nature or the future itself. We shall recur to this work in the twentieth 
chapter of our “Ritual”.

 XI [ K
 THE MAGIC CHAIN
 MANUS FORCE
THE GREAT Magical Agent, by us termed the Astral Light, by others the soul of the
earth, and designated by old chemists under the names of Azoth and MAGNESIA ,
this occult, unique and indubitable force, is the key of all empire, the secret of all
power. It is the winged dragon of Medea, the serpent of the Edenic Mystery; it is
the universal glass of visions, the bond of sympathies, the source of love, prophecy
and glory. To know how to make use of this Agent is to be the trustee of God's
own power; all real, effective Magic, all occult force is there, and its demonstra-
tion is the sole end of all genuine books of science. To have control of the Great
Magical Agent there are two operations necessary – to concentrate and project, or,
in other words, to fix and to move. Fixity has been provided as the basis and
guarantee of movement by the Author of all things: the Magus must go to work in
like manner. 
 It is said that enthusiasm is contagious – and why? Because it cannot be pro-
duced in the absence of rooted faith. Faith produces faith; to believe is to have a
reason for willing; to will with reason is to will with power – I do not say with an
infinite but with an indefinite power. What operates in the intellectual and moral
world obtains still more in the physical, and when Archimedes was in want of a
lever to move the world, he was seeking simply the Great Magical Arcanum. One
arm of the androgyne figure of Henry Khunrath bore the word COAGULA and the
other SOLVE . To collect and diffuse are Nature's two words – but after what man-
ner can we accomplish these operations on the Astral Light or soul of the world?
Concentration is by isolation and distribution by the magical chain. Isolation con-
sists in absolute independence of thought, complete liberty of the heart and per-
fect continence of the senses. Every man who is obsessed by prejudices and fears,
every passionate person who is slave of his passions, is incapable of concentrating
or coagulating, according to the expression of Khunrath, the Astral Light or soul
of the earth. All true adepts have been independent even amidst torture, sober
and chaste unto death. The explanation of such anomaly is this: in order to dis-
pose of a force, you must not be surprised by this force in a way that it may dis-
pose of you. But then, will exclaim those who seek only in Magic for a method of
inordinately satisfying the lusts of nature: “Of what avail is power which must not
be used for our own satisfaction?” Unhappy creatures who ask, if I told you, how
should you understand? Are pearls nothing because they are worthless to the
horde of Epicurus? Did not Curtius prefer the government of those who had gold
rather than its possession by himself? Must we not be a little removed from the
52

 THE MAGIC CHAIN 53
common man when we almost pretend to be God? Moreover, I grieve to deject or 
discourage you, but I am not inventing the transcendental sciences: I teach them, 
defining their immutable necessities in the presentation of their primary and most 
inexorable conditions. Pythagoras was a free, sober and chaste man; Apollonius of 
Tyana and Julius Caesar were both of repellent austerity; the sex of Paracelsus 
was suspected, so foreign was he to the weakness of love; Raymond Lully carried 
the severities of life to the most exalted point of asceticism; Jerome Cardan exag- 
gerated the practice of fasting till he nearly perished of starvation, if we may 
accept tradition; Agrippa, poor and buffeted from town to town, almost died of 
misery rather than yield to the caprice of a princess who insulted the liberty of sci- 
ence. What then made the happiness of these men? The knowledge of great 
secrets and the consciousness of power. It was sufficient for those exalted souls. 
Must one be like unto them in order to know what they knew? Assuredly not, and 
the existence of this book is perhaps a case in point; but in order to do what they 
did, it is absolutely necessary to take the means which they took. Yet what did 
they actually accomplish? They astonish ed and subdued the world; they reigned 
more truly than kings. Magic is an instrument of divine goodness or demoniac 
pride, but it is the annihilation of earthly joys and the pleasures of mortal life. 
Why study it? ask the luxuriou s. In all simplicity, to know it, and possibly after to 
learn mistrust of stupid unbelief or puerile credulity. Men of pleasure, and half of 
these I count for so many women, is not gratified curiosity highly pleasurable? 
Read therefore without fear, you will not be magicians against your will. Readi- 
ness for absolute renunciation is, moreover necessary only in or, der to establish 
universal currents and transform the face of the world; there are relative magical 
operations, limited to a certain circle, which do not need such heroic virtues. We 
can act upon passions by passions, determine sympathies or antipathies, hurt 
even and heal, without possessing the omnipotence of the Magus. In this case, 
however, we must realize the risk of a reaction in proportion to the action, and to 
such risk we may fall easily a victim. All this will be explained in our “Ritual”. 
 To make the Magic Chain is to establish a magnetic current which becomes 
stronger in proportion to the extent of the chain. We shall see in the “Ritual” how 
such currents can be produced, and what are the various modes of forming the 
chain. Mesmer's trough was a chain of an exceedingly imperfect kind; several 
great circles of illuminati in different northern countries possess others more 
potent. Even that association of Catholic priests, celebrated for their occult power 
and their unpopularity, is established upon the plan and follows the conditions of 
the most potent magical chains. 
 Herein is the secret of their force, which they attribute solely to the grace or 
will of God, a vulgar and easy solution for every mystery of power in influence or 
attraction. In the “Ritual” it will be our task to estimate the sequence of truly 
magical ceremonies and evocations which constitute the great work of vocation

54 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
under the name of the Exercises Of St. Ignatius.
 All enthusiasm propagated in a society by a scheme of intercourse and fixed
practices in common produces a magnetic current, and is maintained or increased
by the current. The action of the current is to transport and often to exalt beyond
measure persons who are impressionable and weak, nervous organizations, tem-
peraments inclined to hysteria or hallucination. Such people soon become power-
ful vehicles of magical force and project efficiently the Astral Light in the
direction of the current itself; opposition at such a time to the manifestations of
the force is, to some extent, a struggle with fatality. When the youthful Pharisee
Saul, or Schol, threw himself, with all the fanaticism and all the obstinacy of a
sectarian, across the line of advancing Christianity, he placed himself uncon-
sciously at the mercy of a power against which he thought to prevail, and he was
struck down by a formidable magnetic flash, doubtless the more instantaneous by
reason of the combined effect of cerebral congestion and sunstroke. The conver-
sion of the young Israelite, Alphonus of Ratisbon, is a contemporary fact which is
absolutely of the same nature. We are acquainted with a sect of enthusiasts whom
it is common to deride at a distance, and to join, despite one's self, as soon as they
are approached, even with a hostile intention. I will go further and affirm that
magical circles and magnetic currents establish themselves, and have an influ-
ence, according to fatal laws, upon those on whom they can act. Each one of us is
drawn within a sphere of relations which constitutes his world and to the influ-
ence of which he is made subject. The lawgiver of the French Revolution, that
man whom the most spiritual nation in the whole world acknowledged as the
incarnation of human reason, Jean Jacques Rousseau, was drawn into the most
lamentable action of his life, the desertion of his children, by the magnetic influ-
ence of a libertine circle and a magical current of table-d'hote.He describes it sim- 
ply and ingenuously in his Confessions, but it is a fact which has remained
unobserved. Great circles very often make great men, and vice versa. There are no
unrecognized geniuses, there are eccentric men, and the term would seem to have
been invented by an adept. The man who is eccentric in his genius is one who
attempts to form a circle by combating the central attractive force of established
chains and currents. It is his destiny to be broken or to succeed. Now, what is the
twofold condition of success in such a case? A central point of stability and a per-
sistent circular action of initiative. The man of genius is one who has discovered a
real law and is possessed thereby of an invincible active and directing force. He
may die in the midst of his work but that which he has willed comes to pass in
spite of his death, and is indeed often insured thereby,because death is a veritable 
assumption for genius. “When I shall be lifted up from the earth,” said the great-
est of the initiators, “I will draw all men after me.”
 The law of magnetic currents is that of the movement of the Astral Light itself,
which is always double and augments in a contrary direction. A great action

 THE MAGIC CHAIN 55
invariably paves the way for a reaction of equal magnitude, and the secret of 
phenomenal successes consists entirely in the foreknowledge of reactions. Thus 
did Chateaubriand, penetrat ed with disgust at the Saturnalia of the Revolution, 
foresee and prepare the immense vogue of his Genius of Christianity. To oppose 
one's self to a current at the beginning of its career is to court being destroyed by 
that current, like the great and unfortu nate Emperor Julian; to oppose one's self 
to a current which has run its course is to take the lead of a contrary current. The 
great man is he who comes seasonably and knows how to innovate opportunely. 
In the days of the apostles, Voltaire would have found no echo for his utterances, 
and might have been merely an ingenious parasite at the banquets of Trimalcyon. 
Now, at the epoch wherein we live, everything is ripe for a fresh outburst of 
evangelical zeal and Christian self-devotion, precisely by reason of the prevailing 
general disillusion, egoistic positivism and public cynicism of the coarsest 
interests. The success of certain books and the mystical tendencies of minds are 
unequivocal symptoms of this widespread disposition. We restore and we build 
churches only to realize more keenly that we are void of belief, only to long the 
more for it; once again does the whole world await its Messiah, and he will not 
delay his advent. Let a man, for example, come forward, who by rank or by 
fortune is placed in an exalted position – a pope, a king, even a Jewish millionaire 
– and let this man sacrifice publicly and solemnly all his material interests for the 
weal of humanity; let him make himself the saviour of the poor, the promulgator 
and even the victim of doctrines of renunciation and charity, and he will draw 
round him an immense following: he will accomplish a complete moral revolution 
in the world. But the high place is before all things necessary for such a 
personage, because, in these days of meanness and trickery, any message issuing 
from the lower ranks is suspected of interested ambition and imposture. Ye, then, 
who are nothing, ye who possess nothing, aspire not to be apostles or messiahs. If 
you have faith, and would act in accordance therewith, get possession, in the first 
place, of the means of action, which are the influence of rank and the prestige of 
fortune. In olden times gold was manufactured by science; nowadays science must 
be renewed by gold. We have fixed the volatile and we must now volatilize the 
fixed – in other words, we have materialized spirit, and we must now spiritualize 
matter. The most sublime utterance passes unheeded if it goes forth without the 
guarantee of a name – that is to say of a success which , represents a material 
value. What is the worth of a manuscript? That of the author's signature among 
the booksellers? The established reputation known as Alexandre Dumas et Cie. 
represents one of the literary guarantees of our time. But the house of Dumas is in 
repute only for the romances which are its exclusive productions. Let Dumas 
devise a magnificent Utopia, or discover a splendid solution of the religious 
problem, and no one will take it seriously, despite the European celebrity of the 
Panurge of modern literature.

56 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
 We are in the age of acquired positions, where everyone is appraised according
to his social and commercial standing. Unlimited freedom of speech has produced
such a strife of words that no one inquires what is said, but who has said it. If it be
Rothschild, his Holiness Pius the Ninth, or even Monseigneur Dupanloup, it is
something; but if it be Tartempion, it is nothing, were he even – which is possible,
after all – an unrecognized prodigy of genius, knowledge and good sense. Hence
to those who would say to me: If you possess the secret of great successes and of a
force which can transform the world, whydo you not make use of them? I would 
answer: This knowledge has come to me too late for myself, and I have spent over
its acquisition the time and the resources which might have enabled me to apply
it; I offer it to those who are in a position to avail themselves thereof. Illustrious
men, rich men, great ones of this world, who are dissatisfied with that which you
have, who are conscious of a nobler and larger ambition, will you be fathers of a
new world, kings of a rejuvenated civilization? A poor and obscure scholar has
found the lever of Archimedes, and he offers it to you for the good of humanity
alone, asking nothing whatsoever in exchange.
 The phenomena which quite recently have perturbed America and Europe,
those of table-turning and fluidic manifestations, are simply magnetic currents at
the beginning of their formation, appeals on the part of Nature inviting us, for the
good of humanity, to reconstitute great sympathetic and religious chains. As a
fact, stagnation in the Astral Light wo uld mean destruction to the human race,
and torpor in this Secret Agent has already been manifested by alarming symp-
toms of decomposition and death. For example, cholera-morbus, the potato dis-
ease and the blight on the grape are traceable solely to this cause, as the two
young shepherds of la Salette saw darkly and symbolically in their dream. The
unlooked-for credit which awaited their narrative, and the vast concourse of pil-
grims attracted by a statement so singular and at the same time so vague as that
of these two children, without instruction and almost without morality, are proofs
of the magnetic reality of the fact, and the fluidic tendency of the earth itself to
operate the cure of its inhabitants. Superstitions are instinctive and all that is
instinctive is founded in the very nature of things, to which fact the sceptics of all
times have given insufficient attention. It follows that we attribute the strange
phenomena of table-turning to the Universal Magnetic Agent in search of a chain
of enthusiasms with a view to the formation of fresh currents. The force of itself is
blind, but can be directed by the will of man and is influenced by prevailing opin-
ions. This universal fluid – if we decide to regard it as a fluid – being the common
medium of all nervous organisms and the vehicle of all sensitive vibrations, estab-
lishes an actual physical solidarity between impressionable persons, and transmits
from one to another the impressions of imagination and of thought. The move-
ment of inert objects, determined by undulations of the Universal Agent, obeys
the ruling impression and reproduces in its revelations at one time all the lucidity



--------------------------------------- 75

 THE MAGIC CHAIN 57
of the most wonderful visions, but at another all the eccentricity and falsehood of 
the most vague and incoherent dreams. The blows resounding on furniture, the 
clattering of dishes, the auto-playing of musical instruments, are illusions pro- 
duced by the same cause. The miracles of the convulsionaries of Saint Medard 
were of the same order, and seemed frequently to suspend the laws of Nature. On 
the one hand, exaggeration produced by fascination, which is the special quality 
of delirium occasioned by congestions of the Astral Light; on the other, actual 
oscillations of movements impressed upon inert matter by the subtle and Univer- 
sal Agent of motion and life. Such is thesole basis of these occurrences which look 
so marvellous, as we may demonstrate easily at will by reproducing, in accor- 
dance with rules laid down in the “Ritual”, the most astounding of such phenom- 
ena, and ascertaining, as can be done quite simply, the absence of trickery, 
hallucination or error. 
 It has occurred to me frequently after experiments in the Magic Chain, per- 
formed with persons devoid of good intention or sympathy, that I have been 
awakened with a start in the night by truly alarming impressions and sensations. 
On one such occasion I felt vividly the pressure of an unknown hand attempting 
to strangle me. I rose up, lighted my lamp, and set calmly to work, seeking to 
profit by my wakefulness and to drive away the phantoms of sleep. The books 
about me were moved with considerable noise, papers were disturbed and rustled 
one against another, timber creaked, as if on the point of splitting, and heavy 
blows resounded on the ceiling. With curiosity but also with tranquillity I 
observed all these phenomena, which would not have been less wonderful had 
they been only the product of my imagination, so real did they seem. For the rest, 
I may state that I was in no sense frightened, and during their occurrence I was 
engaged upon something quite foreign to the occult sciences. By the repetition of 
similar phenomena I was led to attempt an experience of evocation, assisted by 
the magical ceremonies of the ancients, when I obtained truly astounding results 
which will be set forth in the thirteenth chapter of this work.

 XII s L 
 THE GREA T WORK 
 DISCITE CRUX 
 THE Great Work is, before all things, the creation of man by himself, that is to
say, the full and entire conquest of his faculties and his future; it is especially the
perfect emancipation of his will, assuring him universal dominion over Azoth and
the domain of Magnesia, in other words, full power over the Universal Magical
Agent. This Agent disguised by the ancient philosophers under the name of the
First Matter, determines the forms of modifiable substance, and we can really
arrive by means of it at metallic tran smutation and the Universal Medicine. This
is not a hypothesis; it is a scientific fact already established and rigorously demon-
strable. Nicholas Flamel and Raymond Lully, both of them poor, indubitably dis-
tributed immense riches. Agrippa never proceeded beyond the first part of the
Great Work, and he perished in the attempt, struggling to possess himself and to
fix his independence. 
 Now, there are two Hermetic operations, the one spiritual, the other material,
and these are mutually dependent. For the rest, all Hermetic science is contained
in the doctrine of Hermes, which is said to have been originally inscribed upon an
emerald tablet. Its first ar ticles have been already expounded, and those follow
which are concerned with the operation of the Great work: 
 “Thou shalt separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross, gently,
with great industry. It rises from eart h to heaven, and again it descends from
heaven to earth, and it receives the power of things above and of things below. By
this means shalt thou obtain the glory of the whole world, and all darkness shall
depart from thee. It is the strong power of every power, for it will overcome all
that is subtle and penetrate all that is solid. Thus was the world created.”
 To separate the subtle from the gross, in the first operation, which is wholly
inward, is to liberate the soul from all prejudice and all vice, which is accom-
plished by the use of Philosophical Salt, that is to say, wisdom; of Mercury, that is,
personal skill and application; finally, of Sulphur, representing vital energy and
fire of will. By these are we enabled to change into spiritual gold things which are
of all least precious, even the refuse of the earth. In this sense we must interpret
the parables of the choir o philosophers, Bernarf d Trevisan, Basil Valentine, Mary
the Egyptian and other prophets of alchemy; but in their works, as in the Great
Work, we must separate skillfully the subtle from the gross, the mystical from the
positive, allegory from theory. If we would read them with profit and understand-
ing, we must take them first of all as allegorical in their entirety, and then descend
from allegories to realities by the way of the correspondences or analogies indi-
58

 THE GREAT WORK 59
cated in the one dogma: That which is above is proportional to that which is 
below, and reciprocally. The word ART when reversed, or read after the manner 
of sacred and primitive characters from right to left, gives three initials which 
express the different grades of the Great Work. T signifies triad, theory and tra- 
vail; R, realization; A, adaptation. In th e twelfth chapter of the “Ritual”, we shall 
give the processes of adaptation in rise among the great masters, especially that 
which is contained in the Hermetic Fortress of Henry Khunrath. We may refer our 
readers also to an admirable treatise attributed to Hermes Trismegistus and enti- 
tled “Minerva Mundi.” It is found only in certain editions of Hermes and contains, 
in allegories full of profundity and poetry, the doctrine of individual self-creation, 
or the creative law consequent on the harmony between two forces which are 
termed fixed and volatile by alchemists, and are necessity and liberty in the abso- 
lute order. The diversity of the forms which abound in Nature is explained, in this 
treatise, by the diversity of spirits, and monstrosity by divergence of efforts. Its 
study and understanding are indispensable for all adepts who would fathom the 
mysteries of Nature and devote themselves seriously to the search after the Great 
Work. 
 When the masters in alchemy say that little time and money are needed to 
accomplish the works of science, above all when they affirm that one vessel is 
alone needed, when they speak of the great and unique Athanor which all can use, 
which is ready to each man's hand, which all possess without knowing it, they 
allude to philosophical and moral alchemy. As a fact, the strong and resolute will 
can arrive in a short time at absolute independence, and we are all in possession 
of the chemical instrument, the great and sole Athanor which answers for the sep- 
aration of the subtle from the gross and the fixed from the volatile. This instru- 
ment, complete as the world and precise as mathematics, is represented by the 
sages under the emblem of the Pentagram or five-pointed star, which is the abso- 
lute sign of human intelligence. I will follow the example of the wise by forbearing 
to name it: it is too easy to divine. 
 The Tarot symbol which corresponds to this chapter was misconstrued by 
Court de Gebelin and Etteilla, who regarded it as the blunder of a German card- 
maker. It represents a man with his hands bound behind him, having two bags of 
money attached to the armpits, and suspended by one foot from a gibbet formed 
by the trunks of two trees, each with the stumps of six lopped branches, and by a 
crosspiece, thus completing the figure of the Hebrew TAU m. The legs of the victim 
are crossed, while his head and elbows form a triangle. Now, the triangle sur- 
mounted by a cross signifies in alchemy the end and perfection of the Great Work, 
a meaning which is identical with that of the letter TAU, the last of the sacred 
alphabet. This Hanged Man is, consequently, the adept, bound by his engage- 
ments and spiritualized, that is, having his feet turned towards heaven. He is also 
the antique Prometheus, expiating by everlasting torture the penalty of his glori-

ous theft. Vulgarly, he is the traitor Judas, and his punishment is a menace to
betrayers of the Great Arcanum. Finally, for Kabalist ic Jews, the Hanged Man,
who corresponds to their twelfth dogma, that of the promised Messiah, is a protes-
tation against the Saviour ac knowledged by Christians, and they seem to say unto
Him still: How canst Thou save others, since Thou couldst not save Thyself?
 In the Sepher-Toldos-Jeshu, an anti-Christian rabbinical compilation, there
occurs a singular parable. Jeshu, says the rabbinical author of the legend, was
travelling with Simon-Barjona and Judas Is cariot. Late and weary they came to a
lonely house, and, being very hungry, could find nothing to eat except an exceed-
ingly lean gosling. It was insufficient for three persons, and to divide it would be
to sharpen without satisfying hunger. They agreed to draw lots, but as they were
heavy with sleep: “Let us first of all slumber,” said Jeshu, “whilst the supper is
preparing; when we wake we will tell our dreams, and he who has had the most
beautiful dream shall have the whole gosling to his own share.” So it was
arranged; they slept and they woke. “As for me,” said St. Peter, “I dreamed that I
was the vicar of God.” “And I,” said Jeshu, “that I was God himself.” “For me,”
said Judas hypocritically, “I dreamed that, being in somnambulism, I arose, went
softly downstairs, took the gosling from the spit, and ate it.” Thereupon they also
went down, but the gosling had vanished altogether. Judas had a waking dream.
 This anecdote is given, not in the text of the Sepher-Toldos-Jeshu itself, but in
the rabbinical commentaries on that work. The legend is a protest of Jewish posi-
tivism against Christian mystic ism. As a fact, while the faithful surrendered them-
selves to magnificent dreams, the proscribed Israelite, Judas of the Christian
civilization, worked, sold, intrigued, became rich, possessed himself of this life's
realities, till he became in a position to advance the means of existence to those
very forms of worship which had so long outlawed him. The ancient worshippers
of the ark remained true to the cultus of the strong-box; the Exchange is now their
temple, and thence they govern the Christian world. The laugh is indeed with
Judas, who can congratulate himself upon not having slept like St. Peter.
 In archaic writings preceding the Captivity, the Hebrew TAU was cruciform,
which confirms further our interpretation of the twelfth symbol of the Kabalistic
Tarot. The Cross, which produ ces four triangles, is also the sacred sign of the
duodenary, and on this account it was called the Key of Heaven by the Egyptians.
So Etteilla, confused by his protracted researches for the conciliation of the ana-
logical necessities of this symbol with his own personal opinion, in which he was
influenced by the erudite Court de Gebelin, placed in the hand of his upright
hanged man, by him interpreted as Prudence, a Hermetic caduceus, formed by
two serpents and a Greek TAU. Seeing that he understood the necessity of the TAU
or Cross on the twelfth leaf of the Book of Thoth, he should have seen also the
manifold and magnificent meaning of the Hermetic Hanged Man, the Prometheus
of science, the living man who touches earth by his thought alone, whose firm

ground is heaven, the free and immolated adept, the revealer menaced with death, 
the conjuration of Judaism against Christ, which seems to be an involuntary 
admission of the secret divinity of the Crucified, and lastly, the sign of the work 
accomplished, the cycle terminated, the intermediary TAU, which resumes for the 
first time, before the final denary, the signs of the sacred alphabet.

 XIII a N 
 NECROMANCY 
 EX IPSIS MORS 
 WE HAVE said that the images of persons and things are preserved in the Astral 
Light. Therein also can be evoked the forms of those who are in our world no 
longer, and by this means are accomplished those mysteries of Necromancy which 
are so contested and at the same time so real. The Kabalists who have discoursed 
concerning the world of spirits have described simply what they have seen in their 
evocations. Eliphas Levi Zahed, who writes this book, has evoked, and he has 
seen. Let us state, in the first place, what the masters have written on their visions 
or intuitions in that which they term the light of glory. We read in the Hebrew 
book concerning the Revolution of Souls that there are three classes of souls – the 
daughters of Adam, the daughters of angels and the daughters of sin. According 
to the same work, there are also three kinds of spirits captive, wandering and free. 
Souls are sent forth in couples; at the same time certain souls of men are born 
widowed, for their spouses are held captive by Lilith and Naemah, queens of the 
stryges: they are souls condemned to expiate the temerity of a celibate's vow. 
Hence, when a man renounces the love of women from his infancy, he makes the 
bride who was destined for him a slave to the demons of debauch. 
 Souls grow and multiply in heaven, as bodies do upon earth. Immaculate souls 
are the daughters of the kisses of angels. Nothing can enter heaven save that 
which comes from heaven. Hence, after death, the divine spirit which animated 
man ascends by itself above and leaves two corpses below, one upon earth, the 
other in the atmosphere; one terrestrial and elementary, the other aerial and side- 
real, one already inert, the other still animated by the universal movement of the 
soul of the world, yet destined to die slowly, absorbed by the astral forces which 
produced it. The terrestrial body is visible; the other is unseen by the eyes of 
earthly and living bodies, nor can it be beheld except by the application of the 
Astral Light to the TRANSLUCID , which conveys its impressions to the nervous sys- 
tem and thus influences the organ of sight, so that it perceives the forms which are 
preserved and the words which are written in the book of vital light. 
 When a man has lived well the astral body evaporates like a pure incense 
ascending towards the superior regions; but should he have lived in sin, his astral 
body, which holds him prisoner, still seeks the object of its passions and wishes to 
return to life. It torments the dreams of young girls, bathes in the stream of spilt 
blood and floats about the places where the pleasures of its life elapsed. It watches 
over treasures which it possessed and buried; it expends itself in painful efforts to 
make fresh material organs and so live again. But the stars draw it up and absorb 
 63

it; it feels its intelligence weaken, its memory gradually vanishes, all its being dis-
solves . . . . Its former vices rise up befor it, assume monstre ous shapes and pursue
it; they attack and devour it . . . . The unfortunate creature thus loses successively
all the members which have ministered to his iniquities; then he dies a second
time and for ever, because he loses his personality and his memory. Souls which
are destined to live, but are not yet purified completely, remain captive for a
longer or shorter period in the astral body, wherein they are burned by the odic
light, which seeks to absorb and dissolve them. It is in order to escape from this
body that suffering souls sometimes enter the organisms of the living and dwell
therein in that stat e which Kabalists term embryonic. Now, it is these aerial bodies
which are evoked by Necromancy. We enter into communion with larvae, with 
dead or perishing substances, by this operation. The beings in question, for the
most part, cannot speak except by a ringing in our ears produced by the nervous
shock to which I have referred, and commonly they can reason only by reflecting
our thoughts and our reveries. To behold these strange forms we must put our-
selves in an abnormal condition akin to sleep or death; in other words, we must
magnetize ourselves and enter into a kind of lucid and waking somnambulism. 
Then Necromancy has real results, and the evocations of Magic can produce 
actual visions. We have said that in the Great Magical Agent, which is the Astral
Light, there are preserved all impressions of things, all images formed either by
rays or reflections. In this same light our dreams come to us; it is this which
befools the insane and misguides their dormant judgement in pursuit of the most
bizarre phantoms. To insure vision without illusion in such light, a powerful will
must help us to isolate reflections and attract rays only. To dream awake is to see
in the Astral Light, and th e orgies of the Sabbath, described by so many sorcerers
in their criminal trials, came to them solely in this manner. The preparations and
the substances used to obtain this result were often horrible, as we shall see in the
“Ritual”, but the result itself was never doubtful. They saw, they heard, they han-
dled the most abominable, most fantastic, most impossible things., We shall 
return to this subject in our fifteenth chapter; at th e present moment we are con-
cerned only with evocation of the dead. 
 In the spring of the year 1854 I had undertaken a journey to London, that I
might escape from internal disquietude and devote myself, without interruption,
to science. I had letters of introduction to persons of eminence who were anxious
for revelations from the supernatural world. I made the acquaintance of several
and discovered in them, amidst much that was courteous, a depth of indifference
or trifling. They asked me forthwith to work wonders, as if I were a charlatan,
and I was somewhat discouraged, for, to speak frankly, far from being inclined to
initiate others into the mysteries of Ceremonial Magic, I had shrunk all along from
its illusions and weariness. Moreover, such ceremonies necessitated an equipment
which would be expensive and hard to collect. I buried myself therefore in the

 NECROMANCY 65
study of the transcendent Kabalah, and troubled no further about English adepts, 
when, returning one day to my hotel, I found a note awaiting me. This note con- 
tained half of a card, divided transversely, on which I recognized at once the seal 
of Solomon. It was accompanied by a small sheet of paper, on which these words 
were pencilled: “Tomorrow, at three o'clock, in front of Westminster Abbey, the 
second half of this card will be given you.” I kept this curious assignation. At the 
appointed spot I found a carriage drawn up, and as I held unaffectedly the frag- 
ment of card in my hand, a footman approached, making a sign as he did so, and 
then opened the door of the equipage. It contained a lady in black, wearing a 
thick veil; she motioned to me to take a seat beside her, showing me at the same 
time the other half of the card. The door closed, the carriage drove off, and the 
lady raising her veil I saw that my appointment was with an elderly person, hav- 
ing grey eyebrows and black eyes of unusual brilliance, strangely fixed in expres- 
sion. “Sir,” she began, with a strongly marked English accent, “I am aware that 
the law of secrecy is rigorous amongst adepts; a friend of Sir B---L--- who has 
seen you, knows that you have been asked for phenomena, and that you have 
refused to gratify such curiosity. You are possibly without the materials; I should 
like to show you a complete magical cabinet, but I must exact beforehand the 
most inviolable silence. If you will not give me this pledge upon your honour, I 
shall give orders for you to be driven to your hotel.” I made the required promise 
and keep it faithfully by not divulging the name, position or abode of this lady, 
whom I soon recognized as an initiate, not exactly of the first order, but still of a 
most exalted grade. We had a number of long conversations, in the course of 
which she insisted always upon the necessity of practical experience to complete 
initiation. She showed me a collection of magical vestments and instruments, lent 
me some rare books which I needed; in short, she determined me to attempt at her 
house the experiment of a complete evoation, for which I prc epared during a 
period of twentyone days, scrupulously observing the rules laid down in the thir- 
teenth chapter of the “Ritual”. 
 The preliminaries terminated on 2nd July; it was proposed to evoke the phan- 
tom of the divine Apollonius and interrogate it upon two secrets, one which con- 
cerned myself and one which interested the lady. She had counted on taking part 
in the evocation with a trustworthy person, who, however, proved nervous at the 
last moment, and, as the triad or unity is indispensable for Magical Rites, I was 
left to my own resources. The cabinet prepared for the evocation was situated in a 
turret; it contained four concave mirrors and a species of altar having a white 
marble top, encircled by a chain of magnetized iron. The Sign of the Pentagram, 
as given in the fifth chapter of this work, was graven and gilded on the white mar- 
ble surface; it was inscribed also in various colours upon a new white lambskin 
stretched beneath the altar. In the middle of the marble table there was a small 1 
copper chafing-dish, containing charcoal of alder and laurel wood; another chaf- 



--------------------------------------- 84

66 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
ing-dish was set before me on a tripod. I was clothed in a white garment, very
similar to the alb of our catholic priests, but longer and wider, and I wore upon
my head a crown of vervain leaves, intertwined with a golden chain. I held a new
sword in one hand, and in the other the “Ritual”. I kindled two fires with the req-
uisite prepared substances, and began reading the evocations of the “Ritual” in a
voice at first low, but rising by degrees. The smoke spread, the flame caused the
objects upon which it fell to waver, then it went out, the smoke still floating white
and slow about the marble altar; I seemed to feel a quaking of the earth, my ears
tingled, my heart beat quickly. I heaped more twigs and perfumes on the chaf-
ing-dishes, and as the flame again burst up, I beheld distinctly, before the altar,
the figure of a man of more than normal size, which dissolved and vanished away.
I recommenced the evocations and placed myself within a circle which I had
drawn previously between the tripod and the altar. Thereupon the mirror which
was behind the altar seemed to brighten in its depth, a wan form was outlined
therein, which increased and seemed to approach by degrees. Three times, and
with closed eyes, I invoked Apollonius. When I again looked forth there was a
man in front of me, wrapped from head to foot in a species of shroud, which
seemed more grey than white. He was lean, melancholy and beardless, and did
not altogether correspond to my preconceived notion of Apollonius. I experienced
an abnormally cold sensation, and when I endeavoured to question the phantom I
could not articulate a syllable. I therefore placed my hand upon the Sign of the
Pentagram, and pointed the sword at the figure, commanding it mentally to obey
and not alarm me, in virtue of the said sign. The form thereupon became vague,
and suddenly disappeared. I directed it to return, and presently felt, as it were, a
breath close by me; something touched my hand which was holding the sword,
and the arm became immediately benumbed as far as the elbow. I divined that the
sword displeased the spirit, and I therefore placed it point downwards, close by
me, within the circle. The human figure reappeared immediately, but I experi-
enced such an intense weakness in all my limbs, and a swooning sensation came
so quickly over me, that I made two steps to sit down, whereupon I fell into a pro-
found lethargy, accompanied by dreams, of which I had only a confused recollec-
tion when I came again to myself. For several subsequent days my arm remained
benumbed and painful. The apparition did not speak to me, but it seemed that
the questions I had designed to ask answered themselves in my mind. To that of
the lady an interior voice replied – Death! – it was concerning a man about whom
she desired information. As for myself, I sought to know whether reconciliation
and forgiveness were possible between two persons who occupied my thoughts,
and the same inexorable echo within me answered – Dead!
 I am stating facts as they occurred, but I would impose faith on no one. The
consequence of this experience on myself must be called inexplicable. I was no
longer the same man; something of another world had passed into me; I was no

longer either sad or cheerful, but I felt a singular attraction towards death, unac- 
companied, however, by any suicidal tendency. I analysed my experience care- 
fully, and, notwithstanding a lively nervous repugnance, I repeated the same 
experiment on two further occasions, allowing some days to elapse between each. 
There was not, however, sufficient difference between the phenomena to warrant 
me in protracting a narrativ e which is perhaps already too long. But the net result 
of these two additional evocations was for me the revelation of two kabalistic 
secrets which might change, in a short space of time, the foundations and laws of 
society at large, if they came to be known generally. 
 Am I to conclude from all this that I really evoked, saw and touched the great 
Apollonius of Tyana? I am not so hallucinated as to affirm or so unserious as to 
believe it. The effect of the preparations, the perfumes, the mirrors, the pantacles, 
is an actual drunkenness of the imagination, which must act powerfully upon a 
person otherwise nervous and impressionable. I do not explain the physical laws 
by which I saw and touched; I affirm solely that I did see and that I did to uch, 
that I saw clearly and distinctly, apart from dreaming, and this is sufficient to 
establish the real efficacy of magical ceremonies. For the rest, I regard the practice 
as destructive and dangerous; if it became habitual, neither moral nor physical 
health would be able to withstand it. The elderly lady whom I have mentioned, 
and of whom I had reason to complain subsequently, was a case in point. Despite 
her asseverations to the contrary, I have no doubt that she was addicted to Necro- 
mancy and Goetia. At times she talked complete nonsense, at others yielded to 
senseless fits of passion, for which it was difficult to discover a cause. I left Lon- 
don without bidding her adieu, and I adhere faithfully to my engagement by giv- 
ing no clue to her identity, which might connect her name with practices, pursued 
in all probability without the knowledge of her family, which I believe to be 
numerous and of very honourable position. 
 There are evocations of intelligence, evocations of love and evocations of hate; 
but, once more, there is no proof whatsoever that spirits leave the higher spheres 
to communicate with us: the opposite, as a fact is more probable. We evoke the 
memories which they have left in the Astral Light, or common reservoir of univer- 
sal magnetism. It was in this light that the Emperor Julian once saw the gods 
manifest, looking old, ill and decrepit – a fresh proof of the influence exercised by 
current and accredited opinions on the reflections of this same Magical Agent, 
which makes our tables talk and answers by taps on the walls. After the evocation 
I have described, I re-read carefully the life of Apollonius, who is represented by 
historians as an ideal of antique beauty and elegance, and I remarked that 
towards the end of his life he was starved and tortured in prison. This circum- 
stance, which remained perhaps in my memory without my being aware of it, 
may have determined the unattractive form of my vision, the latter regarded 
solely as the voluntary dream of a waking man. I have seen two other persons,

whom there is no occasion to name, both differing, as regards costume and
appearance, from what I had expected. For the rest, I commend the greatest cau-
tion to all who propose undertaking similar experiences: their result is intense
exhaustion and frequently a shock sufficient to occasion illness.
 I must not conclude this chapter without mentioning the curious opinions of
certain Kabalists, who distinguish between apparent and real death, holding that
the two are seldom simultaneous. In their view, the majority of persons who are
buried are still alive, while a number of others who are regarded as living are in
reality dead. Incurable madness, for example, would be with them an incomplete
but real death, leaving the earthly form under the purely instinctive control of the
sidereal body. When the human soul suffers a greater strain than it can bear, it
would thus become separated from the body, leaving the animal soul, or sidereal
body, in its place, and these human remains would be less alive in a sense than a
mere animal. Dead persons of this kind are said to be identified by the complete
extinction of the moral and affectionate sense: they are neither bad nor good; they
are dead. Such beings, who are poisonous fungi of the human race, absorb the life
of living beings to their fullest possible extent, and this is why their proximity
depletes the soul and chills the heart. If such corpse-like creatures really existed,
they would stand for all that was recounted in former times about brucalaques
and vampires. Now, are there not certain persons in whose presence one feels less
intelligent, less good, sometimes even less honest? Are there not some whose vicin-
ity extinguishes all faith and all enthusiasm, who draw you by your weaknesses,
who govern you by your evil propensities, and make you die slowly to morality in
a torment like that of Mezentius? These are dead people whom we mistake for liv-
ing beings; these are vampires whom we regard as friends!

 XIV i O 
 TRANSMUT ATIONS 
 SPHERA LUNAE SEMPITERNUM AUXILIUM 
 ST. AUGUSTINE questioned seriously whether Apuleius could have been changed 
into an ass by a Thessalian sorceress, and theologians have long debated about 
the transformation of Nebuchadnezzar into a wild beast, which things merely 
prove that the eloquent doctor of Hippo was unacquainted with magical secrets 
and that the theologians in question were not advanced far in exegesis. We are 
concerned in this chapter with different and more incredible marvels, which are at 
the same time incontestable. I refer to lycanthropy, or the nocturnal transforma- 
tion of men into wolves, long celebrated in country tales of the twilight by the his- 
tories of werewolves. These accounts are so well attested that, with a view to their 
explanation, sceptical science has recourse to furious mania and masquerading as 
animals. But such hypotheses are puerile and account for nothing. Let us turn 
elsewhere for the secret of the phenomena which have been observed on this sub- 
ject and begin with establishing (1) That no person has ever been killed by a were- 
wolf, except by suffocation, without effusion of blood and without wounds; (2) 
That werewolves, though tracked, pursued and even maimed, have never been 
killed on the spot; (3) That persons suspected of these transformations have 
always been found at home, after a werewolf chase, more or less broken up, some- 
times dying, but invariably in their natural form. 
 Let us next establish phenomena of a different order. Nothing in the world is 
better borne out by evidence than the visible and real presence of P. Alphonsus 
Ligouri beside the dying pope, whilst the same personage was simultaneously seen 
at home, far from Rome, in prayer and ecstasy. Further, the simultaneous pres- 
ence of the missionary Francis Xavier in several places at once has been no less 
strictly demonstrated. It will be said that these are miracles, but we reply that 
miracles when they are genuine are simply facts for science. Apparitions of per- 
sons dear to us coincidently with the moment of their death are phenomena of the 
same order and attributable to the same cause. We have spoken of the sidereal 
body, which is intermediary between the soul and the physical envelope. Now, this 
body frequently remains awake while the latter sleeps, and passes in thought 
through all space which universal magnetism opens beforei t. It lengthens without 
breaking the sympathetic chain which attaches it to our heart and brain, and it is 
for this reason that it is so dangerous to awaken dreamers suddenly. As a fact, too 
great a start may break the bond in an instant and cause immediate death. The 
form of our sidereal body is in correspondence with the habitual condition of our 
thoughts, and it modifies, in the long run, the characteristics of the material body. 
 69



--------------------------------------- 88

70 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
That is why Swedenborg, in his somnambulistic intuitions, frequently beheld
spirits in the shape of various animals.
 Let us now make bold to say that a werewolf is nothing else but the sidereal
body of a man whose savage and sanguinary instincts are typified by the wolf;
who, further, whilst his phantom wanders over the country, is sleeping painfully
in his bed and dreams that he is a wolf indeed. What makes the werewolf visible is
the almost somnambulistic excitement caused by the fright of those who behold it,
or else the tendency, more particularly in simple country persons, to enter into
direct communication with the Astral Light, which is the common medium of
visions and dreams. The hurts inflicted on the werewolf do actually wound the
sleeping person by an odic and sympathetic congestion of the Astral Light, and by
correspondence between the immaterial and material body. Many persons will
believe that they are dreaming when they read such things as these, and may ask
whether we are really awake ourselves; but we need only request men of science to
reflect upon the phenomena of gestation and upon the influence of the imagina-
tion of women on the form of their offspring. A woman who had been present at
the execution of a man who was broken on the wheel gave birth to a child with all
its limbs shattered. Let anyone tell us how the impression produced upon the soul
of the mother by a horrible spectacle could so have reacted on the child, and we
will explain in turn why blows received in dreams can bruise and even wound
grievously the body of him who receives them in imagination, above all when that
body is suffering and subjected to nervous and magnetic influences.
 To such phenomena and to the occult laws which govern them must be referred
the effects of bewitchment, of which we shall speak hereafter. Diabolical obses-
sions, and the majority of nervous diseases which affect the brain, are wounds
inflicted on the nervous mechanism by perverted Astral Light, meaning that
which is absorbed or projected in abnormal proportions. All extraordinary and
extra-natural tensions of will predispose to obsessions and nervous diseases;
enforced celibacy, asceticism, hatred, ambition, rejected love, are so many genera-
tive principles of infernal forms and influences. Paracelsus says that the menstru-
ations of women beget phantoms in the air, and from this standpoint convents
would be seminaries for nightmares, while the devils might be compared to those
heads of the hydra of Lerna which were reproduced eternally and propagated in
the very blood from their wounds. The phenomena of possession amongst the
Ursulines of Loudun, so fatal to Urban Grandier, have been misconstrued. The
nuns in reality were possessed by hysteria and fanatica l imitation of the secret
thoughts of their exorcists, these being transmitted to their nervous system by the
Astral Light. They experienced an impression of all the hatreds which this unfor-
tunate priest had conjured up against him, and such wholly interior communica-
tion seemed diabolical and miraculous to themselves. Hence in this tragical affair
everyone acted sincerely, even to Laubardemont, who, in his blind execution of

 TRANSMUTATIONS 71
the prejudged verdicts of Cardinal Richelieu, believed that he was fulfilling the 
duties of a true judge, and as little suspected himself of being a follower of Pontius 
Pilate as he would have recognized in the sceptical and libertine cure of 
Saint-Pierre-du-March a disciple and mart yr of Christ. The possession of the nuns 
of Louvier is scarcely more than a copy of those of Loudun: devils invent little and 
plagiarize one another. The process of Gaufridi and Magdalen de la Palud pos- 
sesses stranger features, for in this case the victims were their own accusers. 
Gaufridi confessed that he was guilty of depriving a number of women of the 
power to defend themselves against his seductions by simply breathing in their 
nostrils. A young and beautiful girl, of noble family, who had been thus insuf- 
flated, described in the greatest detail scenes wherein lubricity seemed to vie with 
the monstrous and grotesque. Such are the ordinary hallucinations of false mysti- 
cism and infringed celibacy. Gaufridi and his mistress were obsessed by their 
mutual chimeras, and the brain of the one reflected the nightmares of the other. 
Was not the Marquis de Sade himself infectious for certain depleted and diseased 
natures? 
 The scandalous trial of Father Girard is a fresh proof of the deliriums of mysti- 
cism and the singular nervous affections which it may entail. The trances of la 
Cadiere, her ecstasies, her stigmata, were all as real as the insensate and perhaps 
involuntary debauchery of her director. She accused him when he wished to with- 
draw from her, and the conversion of this young woman was a revenge, for there 
is nothing more cruel than depraved passions. An influential society, which inter- 
vened in the trial of Grandier for the destruction of the possible heretic, in this 
case rescued Father Girard for the honour of the order. Moreover, Grandier and 
Girard attained the same results by very different means, with which we shall be 
concerned specially in the sixteenth chapter. 
 We act by our imagination on the imagination of others, by our sidereal body 
on theirs, by our organs on their organs, in such a way that, through sympathy, 
whether of inclination or obsession, we possess one another reciprocally and iden- 
tify ourselves with those whom we wish to affect. Reactions against such domina- 
tions may cause the most pronounced antipathy to succeed the liveliest sympathy. 
Love has a tendency to unify beings; in thus identifying, it renders them rivals 
frequently, and hence enemies, if in the depth of the two natures there is some 
unsociable disposition like pride. To fill two united souls with pride in an equal 
degree is to disjoin them by making them rivals. Antagonism is the necessary con- 
sequence of a plurality of gods. 
 When we dream of any living person, either his sidereal body presents itself to 
ours in the Astral Light or at least a reflection thereof, and our impressions at the 
meeting may often make known his secret dispositions in our regard. For exam- 
ple, love fashions the sidereal body of the one in the image and likeness of the 
other, so that the psychic medium of the woman is like a man and that of the man

72 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
like a woman. It was this transfer which the Kabalists sought to express in an
occult manner when they said, in explanation of an obscure passage in Genesis:
“God created love by placing a rib of Adam in the breast of the woman and a por-
tion of the flesh of Eve in the breast of the man, so that at the bottom of woman's
heart there is the bone of man, while at the bottom of man's heart there is the
flesh of woman” – an allegory which is certainly not devoid of depth and beauty.
 We have referred, in the previous chapter, to what the masters in Kabalah call
the embryonic condition of souls. This state, completed after the death of the per-
son who thereby possesses another, is commenced often in life, whether by obses-
sion or by love. I knew a young woman whose parents inspired her with a great
terror, and who began suddenly to inflict upon an inoffensive person the very acts
she dreaded in them. I knew another who, after participating in an evocation con-
cerned with a guilty woman suffering in the next world for certain eccentric acts,
began to imitate, without any reason, the peculiarities of the dead person. To this
occult influence must be attributed the terrible power of a parent's curse, which is
feared by all nations on earth, as also the imminent danger of magical operations
when anyone has not reached the isolation of true adepts. This virtue of sidereal
transmutation, which really exists in love, explains the allegorical marvels of the
wand of Circe. Apuleius speaks of a Thessalian woman who changed herself into a
bird; he won the affections of her servant to discover the secrets of the mistress,
but succeeded only in transforming himself into an ass. This allegory contains the
most hidden secrets of love. Again, the Kabalists say that when a man falls in love
with a female elementary – undine, sylphide or gnomide, as the case may be – she
becomes immortal with him, or otherwise he dies with her. We have seen already
that elementaries are imperfect and as yet mortal men. The revelation we have
mentioned, which has been regarded merely as a fable, is therefore the dogma of
moral solidarity in love, which is itself the foundation of love, explaining all its
sanctity and all its power. Who then is this Circe, that changes her worshippers
into swine, while, so soon as she is subjected to the bond of love, her enchant-
ments are destroyed? She is the ancient courtesan, the marble-hearted woman of
all the ages. She who is without love absorbs and degrades all who approach her;
she who loves, on the other hand, diffuses enthusiasm, nobility and life.
 There was much talk in the last century about an adept accused of charlatan-
ism, who was termed in his lifetime the divine Cagliostro. It is known that he
practised evocations and that in this art he was surpassed only by the illuminated
Schroepffer. It is said also that he boasted of his power in binding sympathies, and
that he claimed to be in possession of the secret of the Great Work; but that which
rendered him still more famous was a certain elixir of life, which immediately
restored to the aged the strength and vitality of youth. The basis of this composi-
tion was malvoisie wine, and it was obtained by distilling the sperm of certain
animals with the sap of certain plants. We are in possession of the recipe, but our
reasons for withholding it will be understood readily.

 XV y P 
 BLACK MAGIC 
 SAMAEL AUXILIATOR 
WE APPROACH the mystery of Black Magic. We are about to confront, even in his 
own sanctuary, the black god of the Sabbath, the formidable goat of Mendes. At 
this point those who are liable to fear should close the book; even persons who are 
a prey to nervous impressions will do well to divert their attention or to abstain. 
We have undertaken a task, and we must complete it. Let us first of all address 
ourselves frankly and boldly to the questions: Is there a devil? What is the devil? 
As to the first point, science is silent, philosophy denies it at hazard, religion only 
answers in the affirmative. As to the second point, religion states that the devil is 
the fallen angel; occult philosophy accepts and explains this definition. It will be 
unnecessary to repeat what we have said previously on the subject, but we may 
add a further revelation: 
 IN BLACK MAGIC , THE DEVIL IS THE GREAT MAGICAL AGENT EMPLOYED FOR EVIL 
PURPOSES BY A PERVERSE WILL. 
 The old serpent of the legend is nothing else than the Universal Agent, the eter- 
nal fire of terrestrial life, the soul of the earth, and the living centre of hell. We 
have said that the Astral Light is the re ceptacle of forms, and these when evoked 
by reason are produced harmoniously, but when evoked by madness they appear 
disordered and monstrous: so originated the nightmares of St. Anthony and the 
phantoms of the Sabbath. Do therefore the evocations of goetia and demonoma- 
nia produce a practical result? Yes, certai nly – one which cannot be contested, one 
more terrible than could ever be recounted in legends! When anyone invokes the 
devil with intentional ceremonies, the devil comes and is seen. To escape dying 
from horror at that sight, to escape catalepsy or idiocy, one must be already mad. 
Grandier was a libertine through indevotion and perhaps also through scepticism; 
excessive zeal, following on the aberrations of asceticism and blindness of faith, 
depraved Girard and made him deprave in his turn. In the fift eenth chapter of our 
“Ritual” we shall give all the diabolical evocations and practices of “Black 
Magic,” not that they may be used, but that they may be known and judged, and 
that such insanities may be put aside for ever. 
 M. Eudes de Mirville, whose book upon table-turning made a certain sensation 
recently, will be contented possibly and discontented at the same time with the 
solution here given of Black Magic and its problems. As a fact, we maintain like 
himself the reality and prodigious nature of the facts; with him also we assign 
them to the old serpent, the occult prince of this world; but we are not agreed as 
to the nature of this blind agent, which, under different leadership, is the instru- 
ment of all good or of all evil, the minister of prophets or the inspirer of pytho- 
 73

74 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
nesses. In a word, the devil, for us, is force placed temporarily at the disposal of
evil, even as mortal sin is, to our thinking, the persistence of the will in what is
absurd. M. de Mirville is therefore a thousand times right, but he is once and one
great time wrong. 
 Whatsoever is arbitrary must be excluded from the realm of things positive.
Nothing happens by chance, nor yet by the autocracy of a good or evil will. There
are two houses in heaven, and the tribunal of Satan is restrained in its extremes
by the Senate of Divine Wisdom.

 XVI r Q 
 BEWITCHMENTS 
 FONS OCULUS FULGUR 
WHEN A MAN gazes unchastely upon any woman he profanes that woman, said the 
Great Master. What is willed with persistence is done. Every real will is confirmed 
by acts; every will confirmed by an act is an action. Every action is subject to a 
judgement, and such judgement is eternal. These are dogmas and principles from 
which it follows that the good or evil which we will, to others as to ourselves, 
according to the capacity of our will and within the sphere of our operation, must 
take place infallibly, if the will be confirmed and the determination fixed by acts. 
Such acts should be analogous to the will. The intent to do harm or to excite love, 
in order to be efficacious, must be confirmed by deeds of hatred or affection. 
Whatsoever bears the impression of a human soul belongs to that soul; whatso- 
ever a man has appropriated after any manner becomes his body in the broader 
acceptation of the term, and anything which is done to the body of a man is felt, 
mediately or immediately, by his soul. It is for this reason that every hostile deed 
committed against one's neighbour is regarded in moral theology as the beginning 
of homicide. Bewitchment is a homicide, and the more infamous because it eludes 
self defence by the victim and punishment by law. This principle being estab- 
lished to exonerate our conscience, and for the warning of weak vessels, let us 
affirm boldly that bewitchment is possible. Let us even go further and lay down 
that it is not only possible but in some sense necessary and fatal. It is going on 
continually in the social world, unconsciously both to agents and patients. Invol- 
untary bewitchment is one of the most terrible dangers of human life. Passional 
sympathy inevitably subjects the most ardent desire to the strongest will. Moral 
maladies are more contagious than physical, and there are some triumphs of 
infatuation and fashion which are comparable to leprosy or choler. We may die of 
an evil acquaintance as well as of a contagious touch, and the frightful plague 
which, during recent centuries only, has avenged in Europe the profanation of the 
mysteries of love, is a revelation of theanalogical laws of Natur e and at the same 
time offers only a feeble image of the moral corruptions which follow daily on an 
equivocal sympathy. There is a story of a jealous and infamous man who, to 
avenge himself on a rival contracted an incurable disorder and made it the com- 
mon scourge and anathema of a divided bed. This atrocious history is that of 
every magician, or rather of every sorcerer who practises bewitchments. He poi- 
sons himself in order that he may poison others; he damns himself that he may 
torture others; he draws in hell with his breath in order that he may expel it by his 
lungs; he wounds himself mortally that he may inflict death on others; but pos- 
 75

76 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
sessed of this unhappy courage, it is positive and certain that he will poison and
slay by the mere projection of his perverse will. There are some forms of love
which are as deadly as hatred, and the bewitchments of goodwill are the torment
of the wicked. The prayers offered to God for the conversion of a man bring mis-
fortune to that man if he will not repent. As we have said, it is weariness and dan-
ger to strive against the fluidic currents stirred up by chains of wills in union.
 Hence there are two kinds of bewitchment, voluntary and involuntary; physical
and moral bewitchment may be distinguished in like manner. Power attracts
power, life attracts life, health attracts he alth: this is a law of Nature. If two chil-
dren live, above all if they sleep together, and if one be weak while the other is
strong, the strong will absorb the weak, and the latter will waste away. For this
reason, it is important that children should sleep always alone. In conventual
seminaries certain pupils absorb the intelligence of the others, and in every given
circle of men one individual emerges who avails himself of the wills of the rest.
Bewitchment by means of currents is exceedingly common, as we have observed
already; morally as well as physically, most of us are carried away by the crowd.
What, however, we have proposed to exhibit more especially in this chapter is the
almost absolute power of the human will upon the determination of its acts and
the influence of every outward demonstration of will upon outward things.
 Voluntary bewitchments are still frequent in our rural places because natural
forces, among ignorant and isolated persons, operate unreduced by any doubt or
any diversion. A frank, absolute hatred, unleavened by rejected passion or per-
sonal cupidity, is, under certain given conditions, a death-sentence for its object. I
say unmixed with amorous passion or cupidity, because a desire, being an attrac-
tion, counterbalances and annuls the power of projection. For example, a jealous
person will never efficaciously bewitch his rival, and a greedy heir will never by
the mere fact of his will succeed in shortening the days of a miserly and long-lived
uncle. Bewitchments attempted under such conditions reflect upon the operator
and help rather than hurt their object, setting him free from a hostile action which
destroys itself by unmeasured exaggeration. The term envoutement (bewitch-
ment) so strong in its Gaelic simplicity, expresses admirably what it means, the
act of enveloping someone, so to speak, in a formulated will. The instrument of
bewitchments is the Great Magical Agent which, under the influence of an evil
will, becomes really and positively the demon. Witchcraft, properly so called, that
is, ceremonial operation with intent to bewitch, acts only on the operator, and
serves to fix and confirm his will, by formulating it with persistence and travail,
the two conditions which make volition efficacious. The more difficult or horrible
the operation, the greater is its power, because it acts more strongly on the imagi-
nation and confirms effort in direct ratio of resistance. This explains the bizarre
nature and even atrocious character of the operations in Black Magic, as practised
by the ancients and in the Middle Ages, the diabolical masses, administration of

 BEWITCHMENTS 77
sacraments to reptiles, effusions of blood, human sacrifices and other monstrosi- 
ties, which are the very essence and reality of Goetia or Nigromancy. Such are the 
practices which from all time have brought down upon sorcerers the just repres- 
sion of the laws. Black Magic is really only a graduated combination of sacrileges 
and murders designed for the permanent perversion of a human will and for the 
realization in a living man of the hideous phantom of the demon. It is therefore, 
properly speaking, the religion of the devil, the cultus of darkness, hatred of good 
carried to the height of paroxysm: it is the incarnation of death and the persistent 
creation of hell: 
 The Kabalist Bodin who has been considered erroneously of a feeble and super- 
stitious mind, had no other motive in writing his Demonomania than that of 
warning people against dangerous incredulity.' Initiated by the study of the 
Kabalah into the true secrets of Magic, he trembled at the danger to which society 
was exposed by the abandonment of this power to the wickedness of men. Hence 
he attempted what at the present time M. Eudes de Mirville is attempting amongst 
ourselves; he gathered facts without interpreting them and affirmed in the face of 
inattentive or preoccupied science the existence of the occult influences and crim- 
inal operations of Evil Magic. In his own day Bodin attracted no more attention 
than will be given to M. Eudes de Mirville, because it is not enough to enumerate 
phenomena and to prejudge their cause if we would influence serious people; we 
must study, explain and demonstrate such cause, and this is precisely what we are 
ourselves attempting. Will better success crown our own efforts? 
 It is possible to die through the love of certain people, even as by their hate. 
There are absorbing passions, under the breath of which we feel ourselves 
depleted like the spouses of vampires. Not only do the wicked torment the good, 
but unconsciously the good torture the wicked. The gentleness of Abel was a long 
and painful bewitchment for the ferocity of Cain. Among evil men, the hatred of 
good originates in the very instinct of self-preservation; moreover, they deny that 
what torments them is good and are driven to deify and justify evil for their own 
peace. In the sight of Cain, Abel was a hypocrite and coward, who abused the 
pride of humanity by his scandalous submissions. to Divinity. How much must 
this first murderer have endured before making such a frightful attack upon his 
brother? Had Abel understood, he would have been afraid. Antipathy is the pre- 
sentiment of a possible bewitchment, either of love or hatred, for we find love fre- 
quently succeeding repulsion. The Astral Light warns us of coming influences by 
its action on the more or less sensible, mor or less active, nee rvous system. Instan- 
taneous sympathies, electric loves, are explosions of the Astral Light, which are as 
exactly and mathematically demonstrable as the discharge of strong magnetic 
batteries. Thereby we may see what unexpected dangers threaten an uninitiated 
person who is perpetually fooling with fire in the neighbourhood of unseen pow- 
der magazines. We are saturated with the Astral Light, and we project it unceas-

ingly to make room for and to attract fresh supplies. The nervous instruments
which are specially designed either for attraction or projection are the eyes and
hands. The polarity of the hand is resident in the thumb, and hence, according to
the magical tradition which still lingers in rural places, whenever anyone is in sus-
picious company, he should keep the thumb doubled up and hidden in the hand,
and while in the main avoiding a fixed glance at anyone, still being the first to
look at those whom we have reason to fear, so as to escape unexpected fluidic pro-
jections and fascinating regards.
 There are certain animals which have the power of breaking the currents of
Astral Light by an absorpti on peculiar to themselves. They are violently antipa-
thetic to us and possess a certain sorcery of the eye: the toad, the basilisk and the
tard are instances. These animals, when tamed and carried alive on the person, or
kept in one's rooms, are a guarantee against the hallucinations and trickeries of
ASTRAL INTOXICATION, a term made use of here for the first time and one which
explains all phenomena of unbridled passions, mental exaltations and folly. Tame
toads and tards, my dear sir, the disciple of Voltaire will say to me: carry them
about with you, but write no more. To which I may answer, that I shall think seri-
ously of so doing if ever I feel tempted to laugh at anything of which I am igno-
rant, or to treat those whose knowledge and wisdom I fail to understand as fools
or as madmen. Paracelsus, the greatest of the Christian Magi, opposed bewitch-
ment by the practices of a contrary bewitchment. He devised sympathetic reme-
dies and applied them, not to the suffering members, but to representations of
these, formed and con serrated according to magical ceremonial. His successes
were incredible, for never has any physician approached Paracelsus in his marvels
of healing. But Paracelsus arrived at magnetism long before Mesmer and had car-
ried to its final consequences this luminous discovery, or rather this initiation into
the Magic of the ancients, who better than us understood the Great Magical Agent
and did not regard the Astral Light, Azot h, the Universal Magnesia of the pages,
as a special animal fluid emanating only from a few secular creatures. In his
occult philosophy, Paracelsus opposes Cermonial Magic, the terrible power ofe
which he did not certainly ignore, but he sought to decry its practices so as to dis-
credit Black Magic. He locates the omnipotence of the Magus in the interior and
occult magnes, and the most skilful magnetizers of our own day could not express
themselves better. At the same time he counselled the employment of magical
symbols, talismans above all, in the cure of diseases. In our eighteenth chapter we
shall have occasion to return to the talismans of Paracelsus, while following Gaf-
farel upon the great question of occult iconography and numismatics.
 Bewitchment may be cured also by substitution, when that is possible, and by
the rupture or deflection of the astral current. The folk-traditions on all these
points are admirable and undoubtedly of remote antiquity; they are remnants of
the teaching of Druids, who were initiated in the Mysteries of Egypt and India by

 BEWITCHMENTS 79
wandering hierophants. Now, it is well known in vulgar Magic that a bewitchment 
– that is, a determined will resolved on doing evil, invariably has its result, and 
cannot draw back without risk of death. The sorcerer who liberates anyone from a 
charm must have another object for his malevolence, or it is certain that he him- 
self will be smitten and will perish as the victim of his own spells. The astral 
movement being circular, every azotic or magnetic emission which does not 
encounter its medium returns with force to its point of departure, thus explaining 
one of the strangest histories in a sacred book, that of the demons sent into the 
swine, which thereupon cast themselves into the sea. This act of high initiation 
was nothing else but the rupture of a magnetic current infected by evil wills. Our 
name is legion, for we are many, said the instinctive voice of the possessed suf- 
ferer. Possessions by the demon are bewitchments, and such cases are innumera- 
ble at the present day. A saintly monk who has devoted himself to the service of 
the insane, Brother Hilarion Tissot, has succeeded, after long experience and 
incessant practice, in curing a number of patients by unconsciously using the 
magnetism of Paracelsus. He attributes most of his cases either to disorder of the 
subjects' will or to the perverse influence of external wills; he regards all crimes as 
acts of madness and would treat the wicked as diseased, instead of exasperating 
and making them incurable, under the pretence of punishing them. What space of 
time must still elapse ere poor Brother Hilarion Tissot shall be hailed as a man of 
genius! And how many serious men, when they read this chapter, will say that 
Tissot and myself should treat one another according to our common ideas, but 
should refrain from publishing our theories, if we do not wish to be reckoned as 
physicians deserving the madhouse. It revolves, notwithstanding, said Galileo, 
stamping his foot upon the earth. Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall 
make you free, said the Saviour of men. It might be added: Ye shall love justice, 
and justice shall make you whole men. A vice is a poison, even for the body; true 
virtue is a pledge of longevity. 
 The method of ceremonial bewitchments varies with times and persons; all 
subtle and domineering people find its secrets and its practice within themselves, 
without even actually calculating about them or reasoning on their sequence. 
Herein they follow instinctive inspirations of the Great Agent, which, as we have 
said, accommodates itself marvellously to our vices and our virtues. It may be 
generally laid down, however, that we are subjected to the wills of others accord- 
ing to the analogies of our tendencies and above all of our faults. To pamper the 
weakness of an individuality is to possess ourselves of that individuality and con- 
vert it into an instrument in the order of the same errors or depravities. Now, 
when two natures whose defects are analogous become subordinated one to 
another, the result is a sort of substitution of the stronger for the weaker, an actual 
obsession of one mind by the other. Vry oe ften the weaker may struggle and seek 
to revolt, but it falls only deeper in servitude. So did Louis XIII conspire against

Richelieu and subsequently, so to speak, sought his pardon by abandoning his
accomplices. We have all a ruling defect, which is for our soul as the umbilical
cord of its birth in sin, and it is by this that the enemy can always lay hold upon
us: for some it is vanity, for others idleness, for the majority egotism. Let a wicked
and crafty mind avail itself of this means and we are lost; we may not go mad or
turn idiots, but we become positively alienated, in all the force of the expression –
that is, we are subjected to a foreign suggestion. In such a state one dreads
instinctively everything that might bring us back to reason, and will not even lis-
ten to representations that are opposed to our obsession. Hereis one of the most 
dangerous disorders which can affect the moral nature. The sole remedy for such
a bewitchment is to make use of folly itself in order to cure folly, to provide the
sufferer with imaginary satisfactions in th e opposite order to that wherein he is
now lost. Endeavour, for example, to cure an ambitious person by making him
desire the glories of heaven – mystic rmedy; cure e one who is dissolute by true
love – natural remedy; obtain honourable successes for a vain person; exhibit
unselfishness to the avaricious and procure for them legitimate profit by honour-
able participation in generous enterprises, etc. Acting in this way upon the moral
nature, we may succeed in curing a number of physical maladies, for the moral
affects the physical in virtue of the magical axiom: “That which is above is like
unto that which is below.” This is why the Master said, when speaking of the par-
alyzed woman: “Satan has bound her.” A disease invariably originates in a defi-
ciency or an excess, and ever at the root of a physical evil we shall find a moral
disorder. This is an unchanging law of Nature.

 ASTROLOGY 
 STELLA OS INFLEXUS 
OF ALL THE ARTS which have originated in ancient magian wisdom astrology is 
now the most misunderstood. No one believes any longer in the universal harmo- 
nies of Nature and in the necessary interconnection of all effects with all causes. 
Moreover, true astrology, that which derives from the unique and universal dogma 
of the Kabalah, became profaned among the Greeks and Romans of the decline. 
The doctrine of the seven spheres and the three mobiles, drawn primitively from 
the sephirotic decade; the character of the planets governed by angels, whose 
names have been changed into those of Pagan divinities; th e influence of the 
spheres on one another; the destiny attached to numbers; the scale of proportion 
between the celestial hierarchies corresponding to the human hierarchies – all this 
has been materialized and degraded into superstition by genethliacal soothsayers 
and erectors of horoscopes during the decline and the Middle Ages. The restora- 
tion of astrology to its primitive purity would be, in a sense, the creation of an 
entirely new science; our present concern is only to indicate its first principles, 
with their more immediate and approximate consequences. We have said that the 
Astral Light receives and pr eserves the impressions of all visible things; it follows 
herefrom that the daily position of the heaven is reflected in this light, which, 
being the chief agent of life, operates the conception, gestation and birth of chil- 
dren by a sequence of apparatuses designed naturally to this end. Now, if this 
light be so prodigal of images as to impart the visible imprints of a maternal fan- 
tasy or appetite to the fruit of pregnancy, still more will it transmit to the plastic 
and indeterminate temperament of a newly-born child the atmospheric impres- 
sions and diverse influences which, in the entire planetary system, are consequent 
at a given moment upon such or such particular aspect of the stars. Nothing is 
indifferent in Nature: a stone more or a stone less upon a road may break or mod- 
ify profoundly the destinies of the greatest men or even the largest empires; still 
more must the position of this or that star in the sky have an influence on the 
child who is born, and who enters by the very fact of his birth into the universal 
harmony of the sidereal world. The stars are bound to one another by the attrac- 
tions which hold them in equilibrium and cause them to move with uniformity 
through space. From all spheres unto all spheres there stretch these indestructible 
networks of light, and there is no point upon any planet to which one of them is 
not attached. The true adept in astrology must give heed therefore to the precise 
time and place of the birth which is in question; then, after an exact calculation of 
the astral influences, it remains for him to compute the chances of estate, that is 
 81

82 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
to say, the advantages or hindrances which the child must one day meet with by
reason of position, relatives, inherited tendencies and hence natural proclivities, in
the fulfilment of his destinies. Finally, he will have also to take into consideration
human liberty and its initiative, should the child eventually come to be a true man
and to isolate himself by strength of will from fatal influences and from the chain
of destiny. It will be seen that we do not allow too much to astrology, but so much
as we leave it is indubitable: it is the scientific and magical calculus of probabili-
ties. 
 Astrology is as ancient as astronomy, and indeed it is more ancient; all seers of
lucid antiquity have accorded it their fullest confidence; and it is not for us to con-
demn and reject lightly anything which comes before us encompassed and sup-
ported by such imposing authorities. Long and patient observations, conclusive
comparisons, frequently repeated experiments, must have led the old sages to
their decisions, and to refute them the same labour must be undertaken from an
opposite standpoint. Paracelsus was perhaps the last of the great practical astrol-
ogers; he cured diseases by talismans formed under astral influences; he distin-
guished upon all bodies the mark of their dominant star; there, according to him,
was the true Universal Medicine, the Absolute Science of Nature, lost by man's
own fault and recovered only by a small number of initiates. To recognize the sign
of each star upon men, animals and plants, is the true natural science of Solomon,
that science which is said to be lost, but the principles of which are preserved not-
withstanding, as are all other secrets, in the symbolism of the Kabalah. It will be
understood readily that in order to read the stars one must know the stars them-
selves; now, this knowledge is obtained by the kabalistic DOMIFICATION of the sky
and by mastering the celestial planisphere, as rediscovered and explained by Gaf-
farel. In this planisphere the constellations form Hebrew letters, and the mytho-
logical figures may be replaced by the symbols of the Tarot. To this same
planisphere Gaffarel refers the origin of patriarchal writing, and the first linea-
ments of primitive characters may very well have been found in the chains of
starry attraction, in which case the celestial book would have served as the model
of Enoch's, and the kabalistic alphabet would have been a synopsis of the entire
sky. This is not wanting in poetry, nor above all in probability, and the study of
the Tarot, which is evidently the primitive and hieroglyphic work of Enoch, as
was divined by the erudite William Postel, is sufficient to convince us hereof.
 The signs imprinted in the Astral Light by the reflecti on and attraction of the
stars are reproduced therefore, as the sages have discovered, on all bodies which
are formed by the co-operation of that light. Men bear the signs of their star on
their forehead chiefly, and in their hands; animals in their whole form and in their
individual signs; plants in their leaves and seed; minerals in their veins and in the
peculiarities of their fracture. The study of these characters was the entire
life-work of Paracelsus, and the figures on his talismans are the result of his

 ASTROLOGY 83
researches; but he has given us no key to these, and hence the astral kabalistic 
alphabet, with its correspondences, still remains to be constructed. As regards 
publicity, the science of nonconventional magical writing stopped with the plani- 
sphere of Gaffarel. The serious art of divination rests wholly in the knowledge of 
these signs. Chiromancy is the art of reading the writing of the stars in the lines of 
the hand, and physiognomy seeks the same or analogous characters upon the 
countenance of querents. As a fact, the lines formed on the human face by ner- 
vous contractions are determined fatally, and the radiation of the nervous tissue is 
absolutely analogous to those networks which are formed between the worlds by 
chains of starry attraction . The fatalities of life are therefore written necessarily in 
our wrinkles, and a first glance frequently reveals upon the forehead of a stranger 
either one or more of the mysterious letters of the kabalistic planisphere. Should 
the letter be jagged and scored deeply, there has been a struggle between will and 
fatality, and in his most powerful emotions and tendencies the individual's entire 
past manifests to the Magus. From this it becomes easy to conjecture the future; 
and if events deceive the sagacity of the diviner from time to time, he who has 
consulted him will remain none the less astounded and convinced by the superhu- 
man knowledge of the adept. 
 The human head is formed upon the model of the celestial spheres; it attracts 
and it radiates, and this it is which first forms and manifests in the conception of 
a child. Hence the head is subject in an absolute manner to astral influence, and 
evidences its several attractions by its diverse protuberances. The final word of 
phrenology is to be found therefore in scientific and purified astrology, the prob- 
lems of which we bequeath to the patience and good faith of scholars. 
 According to Ptolemy, the sun dries up and the moon moistens; according to 
the Kabalists, the sun represents strict Justice, while the moon is in sympathy with 
Mercy. It is the sun which produces storms, and, by a kind of gentle atmospheric 
pressure, the moon occasions the ebb and flow, or, as it were, the respiration of the 
sea. We read in the Zohar, one of the great sacred books of the Kabalah, that “the 
magical serpent, the son of the Sun, was about to devour the world, when the Sea, 
daughter of the moon, set her foot upon his head and subdued him”. For this rea- 
son, among the ancients, Venus was the daughter of the Sea, as Diana was identi- 
cal with the Moon. Hence alsothe na me of Mary signifies star or salt of the sea. To 
consecrate this kabalistic doctrine in the belief of the vulgar, it is said in prophetic 
language: The woman shall crush the serpent's head. 
 Jerome Cardan, one of the boldest students, and beyond contradiction the most 
skilful astrologer of his time – Jerome Cardan, who was a martyr to his faith in 
astrology, if we accept the legend of his death, has left a calculation by means of 
which anyone can foresee the good or evil fortune attached to all years of his life. 
His theory was based upon his own experiences, and he assures us that the calcu- 
lation never deceived him. To ascertain the fortune of a given year, he sums up the

84 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
events of those which have preceded it by 4, 8 , 12, 19 and 30; the number 4 is that
of realization; 8 is the number of Venus or natural things; 12 belongs to the cycle
of Jupiter and corresponds to successes; 19 has reference to the cycles of the Moon
and of Mars; the number 30 is that of Saturn or Fa tality. Thus, for example, I
desire to ascertain what will befall me in this present year, 1855. I pass therefore in
review those decisive events in the order of life and progress which occurred four
years ago; the natural felicity or misfortune of eight years back; the successes or
failures belonging to twelve years since; the vicissitudes and miseries or diseases
which overtook me nineteen years from now and my tragic or fatal experiences of,
thirty years back. Then, taking into a ccount irrevocably accomplished facts and
the advance of time, I calculate the chances analogous to those which I owe
already to the influence of the same planets, and I conclude that in 1851 I had
employment which was moderately but sufficiently remunerative, with some
embarrassment of position; in 1847 I was separated violently from my family, with
great attendant sufferings for mine and me; in 1843 I travelled as an apostle,
addressing the people, and suffering the persecution of illmeaning persons:
briefly, I was at once honoured and proscribed. Finally, in 1825 family life came to
an end for me, and I entered definitely on that fatal path which led me to science
and misfortune. I may suppose therefore that this year I shall experience toil, pov-
erty, vexation, heart exile, change of place, publicity and contradictions, with
some eventuality which will be decisive for the rest of my life: every indication in
the present leads me to endorse this forecast. Hence I conclude that, for myself
and for this year, experience confirms fully the precision of Cardan's astrological
calculus, which connects furthermore with the climacteric years of ancient astrol-
ogers. This term signifies arranged in scales or calculated on the degrees of a
scale. Johannes Trithemius in his book on Secondary Causes has computed the
recurrence of fortunate or calamitous years for all empires of the world. In the
twenty-first chapter of our “Ritual” we shall give an exact analysis of this work,
together with a continuation of the labour of Trithemius to our own days and the
application of his magical scale to contemporary events, so as to deduce the most
striking probabilities relative to the immediate future of France, Europe and the
world. 
 According to all the grand masters in astrology, comets are the stars of excep-
tional heroes, and they visit earth only to signalize great changes; the planets pre-
side over collective existences and modify the destinies of mankind in the
aggregate; the fixed stars, more remote and more feeble in their action, attract
individuals and determine their tendencies. Sometimes a group of stars may com-
bine to influence the destinies of a single man, while often a great number of souls
are drawn by the distant rays of the same sun. When we die, our interior light in
departing follows the attraction of its star, and thus it is that we live in other uni-
verses, where the soul makes for itself a new garment, analogous to the develop-

ment or diminution of its beauty; for our souls, when separated from our bodies, 
resemble revolving stars; they are globules of animated light which always seek 
their centre for the recovery of their equilibrium and their tr ue movement. Before 
all things, however, they must liberate themselves from the folds of the serpent, 
that is, the unpurified Astral Light which envelops and imprisons them, unless the 
strength of their will can lift them beyond its reach. The immersion of the living 
star in the dead light is a frightful torment, comparable to that of Mezentius. 
Therein the soul freezes and burns at the same time, and has no means of getting 
free except by re-entering the current of exterior forms and assuming a fleshly 
envelope, then energetically battling against instincts to strengthen that moral lib- 
erty which will permit it at the moment of its death to break the chains of earth 
and wing its flight in triumph towards the star of consolation which has smiled in 
light upon it. Following this clue, we can understand the nature of the fire of hell, 
which is identical with the demon or old serpent; we can gather also wherein con- 
sists the salvation and reprobation of men, all called and all elected successively, 
but in small number, after having risked falling into the eternal fire through their 
own fault. 
 Such is the great and sublime revelation of the Magi, a revelation which is the 
mother of all symbols, of all dogmas, of all religions. We can realize already how 
far Dupuis was mistaken in regarding astronomy as the source of every cultus. It 
is astronomy, on the contrary, which has sprung from astrology, and primitive 
astrology is one of the branches of the holy Kabalah, the science of sciences and 
the religion of religions. Hence upon the seventeenth page of the Tarot we find an 
admirable allegory – a naked woman, typifying Truth, Nature and Wisdom at one 
and the same time, turns two ewers towards earth, and pours out fire and water 
upon it. Above her head glitters the septenary, starred about an eight-pointed star, 
that of Venus, symbol of peace and love; the plants of earth are flourishing around 
the woman, and on one of them the butterfly of Psyche has alighted. This emblem 
of the soul is replaced in some copies of the sacred book by a bird, which is a more 
Egyptian and probably a more ancient symbol. In the modern Tarot the plate is 
entitled the Glittering Star ; it is analogous to a number of Hermetic symbols, and 
is also in correspondence with the Blazing Star of Masonic initiates, which 
expresses most of the mysteries of Rosicrucian secret doctrine.

 JUSTITIA MYSTERIUM CANES 
WE HAVE now to approach the most criminal abuse to which magical sciences can 
be put, namely, venomous Magic, or rather sorcery. Let it be understood here that 
we write not to instruct but to warn. If human justice, instead of punishing the 
adepts, had proscribed only the nigromancers and poisoning sorcerers, it is cer- 
tain, as we have observed previously, that its severity would have been well 
placed, since the most severe penalties could never be excessive in the case of such 
criminals. At the same time it must not be supposed that the right of life and 
death which belongs secretly to the Magus has been exercised always to satisfy 
some infamous vengeance, or some cupidity more infamous still. In the Middle 
Ages, as in the ancient world, magical associations have frequently struck down 
or destroyed slowly the revealers or profaners of mysteries, and when the magic 
sword has refrained from striking, when the spilling of blood was dangerous, then 
Aqua Toffana, poisoned nosegays, the shirt of Nessus, and other deadly instru- 
ments, still stranger and stil l less known, were used to carry out sooner or later the 
terrible sentence of the free judges. We have said that there is in Magic a great and 
indicible Arcanum, which is never mentioned among adepts, which the profane 
above all must be prevented from divining. In former times, whosoever revealed, 
or caused the key of this supreme secret to be discovered by others through 
imprudent revelations, was condemned immediately to death, and was often 
driven to execute the sentence himself. The celebrated prophetic supper of 
Cazotte, described by Laharpe, has not been understood hitherto. Laharpe very 
naturally yielded to the temptation of surprising his readers by amplifying the 
details of his narrative. Everyone present at this supper, Laharpe excepted, was 
an initiate who had divulged or at least profaned the mysteries. Cazotte, the most 
exalted of all in the scale of initiation, pronounced their sentence of death in the 
name of illuminism, and this sentence was executed variously but rigorously, even 
as several years and several centuries previously had occurred in the case of simi- 
lar judgements against the Abbe de Villars, Urban Grandier and many others. 
The revolutionary philosophers perished, as did Cagliostro deserted in the prisons 
of the Inquisition; as did the mystic band of Catherine Theos; as did the impru- 
dent Schroepffer, driven to suicide in the midst of magical triumphs and the uni- 
versal infatuation; as did the deserter Kotzebue, who was stabbed by Carl Sand; 
as did also so many others whose corpses have been discovered without anyone 
being able to ascertain the cause of their sudden and sanguinary death. The 
strange allocution addressed to Cazotte when he himself was condemned by the 
president of the revolutionary tribunal will be called readily to mind. The Gordian

Knot of the terrible drama of '93 is still concealed in the darkest sanctuary of the
Secret Societies. To adepts of good faith, who sought to emancipate the common
people, were opposed those of another sect, attached to more ancient traditions,
who fought against them by means analogous to those of their adversaries: the
practice of the Great Arcanum was made impossible by unmasking its theory. The
crowd understood nothing, but it misdoubted everything, and fell lower still in its
discouragement than some had schemed to raise it. The Great Arcanum became
more secret than ever; the adepts, checkmated by each other, could exercise their
power neither to govern the uninitiated nor to deliver themselves; they con-
demned one another to the death of traitors; they aba ndoned one another to exile,
to suicide, to the knife and the scaffold.
 I shall be asked possibly whether equally terrible dangers threaten at this day
the intruders into the occult sanctuary and the betrayers of its secret. Why should
I answer anything to the incredulity of the inquisitive? If I risk a violent death for
their instruction, certainly they will not save me; if they are afraid on their own
account, let them abstain from imprudent research – this is all I can say to them.
Let us return to Venomous Magic.
 In his romance of Monte Christo, Alexandre Dumas has revealed some prac-
tices of this ominous science. There is no need to traverse the same ground by
repeating its melancholy theories of crime; describing how plants are poisoned;
how animals nourished on these plants have their flesh infected, and becoming in
turn the food of men, cause death without leaving any trace of poison; how the
walls of houses are inoculated; how the air is permeated by fumes which require
the glass mask of St. Croix for the operator. Let us leave the ancient Canidia her
abominable mysteries, and refrain from investigating the extent to which the
infernal rites of Sagana have carried the art of Locusta. It is enough to state that
this most infamous class of malefactors distilled together the virus of contagious
diseases, the venom of reptiles and the sap of poisonous plants; that they
extracted from the fungus its deadly and narcotic properties, its asphyxiating
principles from Datura arts-monium, from the peach and bitter almond that poi-
son one drop of which, placed on the tongue or in the ear, destroys, like a flash of
lightning, the strongest and best constituted living being. The white juice of
sea-lettuce was boiled with milk which vipers and asps had been drowned. The
sap of the manchineel or deadly fruit of Java was either brought back with them
from their long journeys, or imported at great expense; so also was the juice of the
cassada, and so were similar poisons. They pulverized flint, mixed with impure
ashes the dried slime of reptiles, composed hideous philtres with the virus of
mares on heat and similar secretions of bitches; they mingled human blood with
infamous drugs, composing an oil the mere odour of which was fatal, therein
recalling the tarte bourbonnaise of Panurge; they even concealed recipes for poi-
soning in the technical language of alchemy, and the secret of the Powder of Pro-

jection, in more than one old book which claims to be Hermetic, is in reality that 
of the Powder of Succession. The Grand Grimoire gives one in particular which is 
very thinly disguised under the title of “Method of Making Gold”; it is an atro- 
cious decoction of verdigris, arsenic and sawdust, which, if properly prepared, 
should consume immediately a branch that is plunged into it and eat swiftly 
through an iron nail. John Baptist Porta cites in his Natural Magic a specimen of 
Borgia poison, but, as may be imagined, he is deceiving the vulgar and does not 
divulge the truth, which would be too dangerous in such a connexion. We may 
therefore quote his recipe to satisfy the curiosity of our readers. 
 The toad itself is not venomous, but it is a sponge for poisons, and is the mush- 
room of the animal kingdom. Take, then, a plump toad, says Porta, and place it 
with vipers and asps in a globular bottle. Let poisonous fungi, foxgloves and hem- 
lock be their sole nourishment during a period of several days. Then enrage them 
by beating, burning and tormenting in every conceivable manner, till they die of 
rage and hunger; sprinkle their bodies with powdered spurge and ground glass; 
place them in a well-sealed retort; and extract all their moisture by fire. Let the 
glass cool; separate the ash of the dead bodies from the incombustible dust which 
will remain at the bottom of the retort. You will then have two poisons – one liq- 
uid, the other a powder. The first will be fully as efficacious as the terrible Aqua 
Toffana; the second, in a few days' time, will cause any person who may have a 
pinch of it mixed with his drink to grow wilted and old, and subsequently to die 
amidst horrible sufferings, or in a state of complete collapse. It must be admitted 
that this recipe has a magical physiognomy of the blackest and most revolting 
kind, and sickens one by its recollections of the abominable confections of 
Canidia and Medea. The sorcerers of the Middle Ages pretended to receive such 
powders at the Sabbath and sold them at a high price to the malicious and igno- 
rant. The tradition of similar mysteries spread terror in country places and came 
to act as a spell. The imagination once impressed, the nervous system once 
assailed, the victim rapidly wasted away, the very dread of his relatives and 
friends sealing his doom. The sorcerer and sorceress were almost invariably a spe- 
cies of human toad, swollen with long-enduring rancours. They were poor, 
repulsed by all and consequently full of hatred. The fear which they inspired was 
their consolation and their revenge; poisoned themselves by a society of which 
they had experienced nothing but the rebuffs and the vices, they poisoned in their 
turn all those who were weak enough to fear them, and avenged upon beauty and 
youth their accursed old age and their atrocious ugliness. The perpetration of 
these evil works and the fulfilment of these loathsome mysteries constituted and 
confirmed what was then called a pact with the devil. It is certain that the opera- 
tor must have been given over body and soul to evil and justly deserved the uni- 
versal and irrevocable reprobation expressed by the allegory of hell. That human 
souls could descend to such an abyss of crime and madness must assuredly aston-

ish and afflict us. But is not such gulf needed as a basis for the exaltation of the
most sublime virtues? Does not the depth of infernus demonstrate by antithesis
the infinite height and grandeur of heaven?
 In the north, where the instincts are more repressed and deep rooted; in Italy,
where the passions are more unreserved and fiery, charms and the evil eye are still
dreaded; the jettatura is not to be braved with impunity in Naples, and persons
who are endowed unfortunately with this power are even distinguished by certain
exterior signs. In order to guard against it, experts affirm that horns must be car-
ried on the person, and the common people, who take everything literally, hasten
to adorn themselves with small horns, not dreaming of the sense of the allegory.
These attributes of Jupiter Ammon, Bacchus and Moses are a symbol of moral
power or enthusiasm, so that the magicians mean to say that, in order to with-
stand the jettatura, the fatal current of in stincts must be governed by great intre-
pidity, great enthusiasm, or a great thought. In like manner, almost all popular
superstitions are vulgar interpretations of some grand maxim or marvellous secret
of occult wisdom. Did not Pythagoras, in his admirable symbols, bequeath a per-
fect philosophy to sages but a new series of vain observances and ridiculous prac-
tices to the vulgar? Thus, when he said: “Do not pick up what falls from the table;
do not cut down trees on the great highway; kill not the serpent when it slips into
your garden.” – was he not inculcating the precepts of charity, either social or per-
sonal, under transparent allegories? When he said: “Do not look at yourself by
torchlight in a mirror,” was he not teaching ingeniously that true self-knowledge
which is incompatible with factitious lights and the prejudgments of systems? It is
the same with the other precepts of Pythagoras, who is well known to have been
followed literally by a swarm of unintelligent disciples; and indeed amongst our
provincial superstitious observances there are many which belong indubitably to
the primitive misconception of Pythagorean symbols.
 Superstition is derived from a Latin word which signifies survival. It is the sign
surviving the thought; it is the dead body of a Religious Rite. Superstition is to ini-
tiation what the notion of the devil is to that of God. This is the sense in which the
worship of images is forbidden, and in this sense also a doctrine most holy in its
original conception may become superstitious and impious when it has lost its
spirit and its inspiration. Then does religion, ever one, like the Supreme Reason,
exchange its vestures and abandon old Rites to the cupidity and roguery of fallen
priests, transformed by their wickedness and ignorance into jugglers and charla-
tans. We may include among superstitions those magical emblems and characters,
of which the meaning is understood no longer, which are engraved by chance on
amulets and talismans. The magical images of the ancients were pantacles, i.e.
kabalistic syntheses. Thus the wheel of Pythagoras is a pantacle analogous to the
wheels of Ezekiel; the two emblems contain the same secrets and belong to the



--------------------------------------- 109

 91
same philosophy; they constitute the key of all pantacles, and we have made men- 
tion previously of both. 
 The four living creatures – or rather the four-headed sphinx – of the same 
prophet are identical with the admirable Indian symbol of ADDA-NARI , given on 
the next page, as having reference to the Great Arcanum. In his Apocalypse St. 
John followed and elaborated Ezekiel; indeed the monstrous figures of his won- 
derful book are so many magical pantacles, the key of which is easily discoverable 
by Kabalists. On the other hand, Christia ns, rejecting science in their anxiety to 
extend faith, sought later on to conceal the origin of their dogmas and condemned 
all kabalistic and magical books to the flames. To destroy originals gives a kind of 
originality to copies, as was doubtless in the mind of St. Paul when, prompted 
beyond question by the most laudable intention, he accomplished his scientific 
auto-da-fe at Ephesus. In the same way, six centuries later, the true believer Omar 
sacrificed the Library of Alexandria to the originality of the Koran, and who 
knows whether in the time to come a future Apostle will not set fire to our literary 
museums and confiscate the printing-press in the interest of some fresh religious 
infatuation, some newly accredited legend? 
 The study of talismans and pantacles is one of the most curious branches of 
Magic and connects with historical numismatics. There are Indian, Egyptian and 
Greek talismans, kabalistic medals coming from ancient and modern Jews, Gnos- 
tic abraxas, occult tokens in use among members of Secret Societies and some- 
times called counters of the Sabbath. So also there are Templar medals and jewels

of Freemasonry. In his “Treatise on the Wonders of Nature”, Coglenius describes
the talismans of Solomon and those of Rabbi Chael. Designs of many others that
are most ancient will be found in the Magical Calendars of Tycho Brahe and
Duchentau, and should have a place in M. Ragon's archives on initiation, a vast
and scholarly undertaking, to which we refer our readers.'

 XIX f T 
 THE STONE OF THE PHILOSOPHERS – ELAGABALUS 
 VOCATIO SOL AURUM 
THE ANCIENTS adored the Sun under the figure of a black stone, which they 
named Elagabalus, or Heliogabalus. What did this stone signify, and how came it 
to be the image of the most brilliant of luminaries? The disciples of Hermes, 
before promising their adepts the elixir of long life or the powder of projection, 
counselled them to seek for the Philosophical Stone. What is this Stone, and why 
is it so called? The Great Initiator of the Christians invites His believers to build 
on the stone or rock, if they do not wish their structures to be demolished. He 
terms Himself the cornerstone, and says to the most faithful of His Apostles, 
“Thou art Peter (petrus), and upon this rock (petram) I will build My church.” 
This Stone, say the masters in Alchemy, is the true Salt of the Philosophers, which 
is the third ingredient in the composition ofA ZOTH . Now, we know already that 
AZOTH is the name of the great Hermetic and true Philosophical Agent; further- 
more, their Salt is represented under the figure of a cubic stone, as may be seen in 
the TWELVE KEYS of Basil Valentine, or in the allegories of Trevisan. Once more, 
what is this Stone actually? It is th e foundation of absolute philosophy, it is 
supreme and immovable reason. Before even dreaming of the metallic work, we 
must be fixed for ever upon the absolute principles of wisdom; we must possess 
that reason which is the touchstone of truth. Never will a man of prejudices 
become the king of Nature and the master of transmutations . The Philosophical 
Stone is hence before all things necessary; but how is it to be found? Hermes 
informs us in his “Emerald Table”. We must separate the subtle from the fixed 
with great care and assiduous attention. Thus, we must separate our certitudes 
from our beliefs, and distinguish sharply the respective domains of science and 
faith, realizing that we do not know things which we believe, and that we cease 
immediately to believe anything which we come actually to know. It follows that 
the essence of the things of faith is the unknown and the indefinite, while it is 
quite the reverse with the things of science. It must be inferred from this that sci- 
ence rests on reason and experience, whilst the basis of faith is sentiment and rea- 
son. In other words, the Philosophical Stone is the true certitude which human 
prudence assures to conscientious researhes and modest doubt, whilst rc eligious
enthusiasm ascribes it exclusively to faith. Now, it belongs neither to reason with- 
out aspirations nor to aspirations without reason; true certitude is the reciprocal 
acquiescence of the reason which knows in the sentiment which believes and of 
the sentiment which believes in the reason which knows. The permanent alliance 
of reason and faith will result not from their absolute distinction and separation, 
but from their mutual control arid their frater nal concurrence. Such is the signifi- 
 93

cance of the two Pillars of Solomon's Porch, one named JAKIN and the other BOAZ,
one white and the other black. They are distinct and separate, they are even con-
trary in appearance, but if blind force sought to join them by bringing them close
to one another, the roof of the temple would collapse. Separately, their power is
one; joined, they are two powers which destroy one another. For precisely the
same reason the spiritual power is weakened whensoever it attempts to usurp the
temporal, while the temporal power becomes the victim of its encroachments on
the spiritual. Gregory VII ruined the Papacy; the schismatic kings have lost and
will lose the monarchy. Human equilibrium requires two feet; the worlds gravitate
by means of two forces; generation needs two sexes. Such is the meaning of the
arcanum of Solomon, represented by the two Pillars of the Temple, JAKIN and
BOAZ . 
 The Sun and Moon of the alchemists correspond to the same symbol and con-
cur in the perfection and stability of the Philosophical Stone. The Sun is the
hieroglyphic sign of truth, because it is the visible source of light, and the rough
stone is the symbol of stability. This is why the ancient Magi regarded the stone
Elagabalus as the actual type of the sun, and for this reason the mediaeval alche-
mists pointed to the Philosophical Stone as the first means of making philosophi-
cal gold, that is to say, of transforming the vital forces represented by the six
metals into Sol, otherwise into truth and light, the first and indispensable opera-
tion of the Great Work, leading to the secondary adaptations and discovering, by
the analogies of Nature, the natural and grosser gold to the possessors of the spir-
itual and living gold, of the true Salt, the tr ue Mercury and the true Sulphur of the
philosophers. To find the Philosophical Stone is then to have discovered the Abso-
lute, as the masters say otherwise. Now, the Absolute is that which admits of no
errors; it is the fixation of the volatile,; it is the rule of the imagination; it is the
very necessity of being; it is the immutable law of reason and truth. The Absolute
is that which is. Now that which is in some sense precedes he who is. God Himself
cannot be in the absence of a ground of being and can exist only in virtue of a
supreme and inevitable reason. It is this reason which is the Absolute; it is this in
which we must believe if we desire a rational and solid foundation for our faith. It
may be said in these days that God is merely a hypothesis, but the Absolute Rea-
son is not: it is essential to being.
 St. Thomas once said: “A thing is not just because God wills it, but God wills it
because it is just.” Had St. Thomas deduced all the consequences of this beautiful
thought, he would have found the Philosophical Stone, and besides being the
angel of the schools, he would have been their reformer. To believe in the reason
of God and in the God of reason is to render atheism impossible. When Voltaire
said: “If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent Him,” he felt rather
than understood the reason which is in God. Does God really exist? There is no
knowing, but we desire it to be so, and hence we believe it. Faith thus formulated



--------------------------------------- 113

 95
is reasonable faith, for it admits the doubt of science, and, as a fact, we believe 
only in things which seem to us probable, though we do not know them. To think 
otherwise is delirium; to speak otherwise is to talk like illuminati or fanatics. Now, 
it is not to such persons that the Philosophical Stone is promised. The ignora- 
muses who have turned primitive Christianity from its path by substituting faith 
for science, dream for experience, the fantastic for the real – inquisitors who, dur- 
ing so many ages, have waged a war of extermination against Magic – have suc- 
ceeded in enveloping with darkness the ancient discoveries of the human mind, so 
that we are now groping for a key to the phenomena of Nature. Now, all natural 
phenomena depend upon a single and immutable law, represented by the Philo- 
sophical Stone and especially by its cubic form. This law, expressed by the tetrad 
in the Kabalah, equipped the Hebrews with all the mysteries of their divine Tetra- 
gram. It may be said therefore that the Philosophical Stone is square in every 
sense, like the heavenly Jerusalem of St. John; that one of its sides is inscribed 
with the name SHLMH and the other with that of GOD; that one of its facets 
bears the name of ADAM , a second that of HEVA , and the two others those of 
AZOT and INRI. At the beginning of the French translation of a book by the Sieur 
de Nuisement on the Philosophical Salt, the spirit of the earth is represented 
standing on a cube over which tongues of flame are passing; the phallus is 
replaced by a caduceus; the sun and moon figure on the right and left breast; the 
figure is bearded, crowned and holds a sceptre in his hand. This is the AZOTH of 
the sages on its pedestal of Salt and Sulphur. The symb olic head of the goat of 
Mendes is occasionally given to this figure, and it is then the Baphomet of the 
Templars and the Word of the Gnostics, bizarre images which became scarecrows 
for the vulgar after affording food for reflection to sages – innocent hieroglyphs of 
thought and faith which have been a pretext for the rage of persecutions. How 
pitiable are men in their ignorance, but how they would despise themselves if only 
they came to know!

 XX w U
 THE UNIVERSAL MEDICINE
 CAPUT RESURRECTIO CIRCULUS
THE MAJORITY of our physical complaints come from our moral diseases, accord-
ing to the one and universal dogma, and by reason of the law of analogies. A great
passion to which we abandon ourselves corresponds always to a great malady in
store. Mortal sins are so named because they cause death physically and posi-
tively. Alexander the Great died of pride; he was naturally temperate, and it was
through pride that he yielded to the excess which occasioned his death. Francis I
died of an adultery. Louis XV died of his Parc-aux-Cerfs. When Marat was assas-
sinated he was perishing of rage and envy. He was a monomaniac of pride, who
believed himself to be the only just man and would have slain everything that was
not Marat. Several of our contemporaries perished of fallen ambition after the
Revolution of February. So soon as any will is confirmed irrevocably in the ten-
dency towards the absurd, the man is dead, and the rock on which he will break is
not remote. 
 It is therefore true to say that wisdom preserves and prolongs life. The great
Master told us: “My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He that
eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath everlasting life.” And when the
crowd murmured, He added: “Here the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I
speak unto you are spirit and life.” So also, when He was about to die, He
attached the remembrance of His life to the sign of Bread, and that of His spirit to
the symbol of Wine, thus instituting the communion of faith, hope and charity.
Now, it is in the same sense that the Hermetic masters have said: Make gold pota-
ble, and you will have the Universal Medicine – that is to say, appropriate truth to
your needs, let it become the source at which you daily drink, and you will in
yourself have the immortality of the sages. Temperance, tranquillity of soul, sim-
plicity of character, calmness and rational ity of will, these things not only make us
happy but strong and well. By growth in reason and goodness man becomes
immortal. We are the authors of our own destiny, and God does not save us apart
from our own concurrence. There is no death for the sage; death is a phantom,
made horrible by the weakness and ignorance of the vulgar. Change is the sign of
motion, and motion reveals life; if the corpse itself were dead, its decomposition
would be impossible; all its constituent molecules are living and working out their
liberation. Yet you dream that the spirit is set free first so that it may cease to live!
You believe that thought and love can die when the grossest matter is imperish-
able! If change must be called death, we die and are reborn daily, because daily
our forms change. Fear therefore to soil or rend your garments, but do not fear to
96 



--------------------------------------- 115

 97
lay them by when the hour of sleep approaches. 
 The embalming and mummification of bodies is a superstition which is against 
Nature; it is an attempt to create death; it is the forcible petrification of a sub- 
stance which is needed by life. But, on the other hand, we must not be quick to 
destroy or make away with bodies; there is no suddenness in the operations of 
Nature, and we must not risk any violent rupture of the bonds of a departing soul. 
Death is never instantaneous; it is, like sleep, gradual. So long as the blood has 
not become absolutely cold, so long as the nerves can quiver, a man is not wholly 
dead, and if none of the vital organs are destroyed the soul can be recalled, either 
by accident or by a strong will. A philosopher declared that he would discredit 
universal testimony rather than believe in the resurrection of a dead person, but 
his utterance was rash, for it was on the faith of universal testimony that he 
believed in the impossibility of resurrection. Supposing such an occurrence were 
proved, what would follow? Must we deny evidence or renounce reason? 
 It would be absurd to say so. We should infer rather that we were wrong in sup- 
posing resurrection to be impossible. Ab actu ad posse valet consecutio. 
 Let us now make bold to affirm that resurrection is possible and occurs oftener 
than might be thought. Many persons whose deaths havebeen attested legally and 
scientifically have been found afterwards in their coffins dead indeed, but having 
evidently come to life and having bitten through their clenched hands so as to 
open the arteries and escape from their horrible agonies. A doctor would tell us 
that such persons were in a lethargy and not dead. But what is lethargy? It is the 
name which we give to an uncompleted death, a death which is falsified by return 
to life. It is easy by words to escape from a difficulty when it is impossible to 
explain facts. The soul is joined to the body by means of sensibility, and when 
sensibility ceases it is a sure sign that the soul is departing. The magnetic sleep is 
a lethargy or factitious death which is curable at will. The etherization or torpor 
produced by chloroform is a real lethargy which ends sometimes in absolute 
death, when the soul, ravished by its temporary liberation, makes an effort of will 
to become free altogether, which is possible for those who have conquered hell, 
that is to say, whose moral strength is superior to that of astral attraction. Hence 
resurrection is possible only for elementary souls, and it is these above all who run 
the risk of involuntary revival in the tomb. Great men and true sages are never 
buried alive. The theory and practice of resurrection will be given in our “Ritual”; 
to those meanwhile who may ask whether I have raised the dead, I would say that 
if I replied in the affirmative they would not believe me. 
 It remains now to examine whether the abolition of pain is possible, and 
whether it is wholesome to employ chloroform or magnetism for surgical opera- 
tions. We think, and science will acknowledge it lateron, that by diminishing sen- 
sibility we diminish life, and what we subtract from pain under such 
circumstances turns to the profit of death. Suffering bears witness to the struggle

for life, and hence we observe that the dressing of a wound is excessively painful
for the persons who have been operated on under anaesthetics. If chloroform were
resorted to at each dressing, one of two things would happen – either the patient
would die or the pain would return and continue between the dressings. Nature is
not violated with impunity.

 DIVINA TION 
 DENTES FURCA AMENS 
THE AUTHOR of this book has dared many things in his life, and never has fear 
retained his thought a prisoner. It is not at the same time without legitimate dread 
that he approaches the end of the magical doctrine. It is a question now of reveal- 
ing, or rather reveiling, the Great Secret, the terrible secret, the secret of life and 
death, expressed in the Bible by those formidable and symbolical words of the ser- 
pent, who was himself symbolical: I. NEQUAQUAM MORIEMINI ; II. SED ERITIS ; III. 
SICUT DII; IV. SCIENTES BONUM ET MALUM . One of the privileges which belong to 
the initiate of the Great Arcanum, and that which sums them all, is DIVINATION . 
According to the vulgar comprehension of the term, to divine signifies to conjec- 
ture what is unknown, but its true sense is ineffable in its sublimity. To divine 
(divinare ) is to exercise divinity. The worddivinus in Latin signifies something far 
different from divus, which is equivalent to man-god. Devin, in French, contains 
the four letters of the word DIEU (God), plus the letter N, which corresponds in its 
form to the Hebrew ALEPH ' , and kabalistically and hieroglyphically expresses 
the Great Arcanum, the Tarot symbol of which is the Juggler. Whosoever under- 
stands perfectly the absolute numeral value of M multiplied by N, with the gram- 
matical force of the N final in words which signify SCIENCE , ART or POWER, who 
subsequently adds the five letters of the wordD EVIN , in such a way as to make 
five go into four, four into three, three into two and two into one, such a person, 
by translating the resultant number into primitive Hebrew characters, will write 
the occult name of the Great Arcanum, and will possess a word of which the 
Sacred Tetragram itself is only the equivalent and the image. 
 To be a diviner, according to the force of the term, is hence to be divine, and 
something more mysterious still. Now, the two signs of human divinity, or of 
divine humanity, are prophecies and miracles. To be a prophet is to see before- 
hand the effects which exist in causes, to read in the Astral Light; to work mira- 
cles is to act upon the Universal Agent and subject it to our will. The author of 
this book will be asked whether he is a prophet and thaumaturge. Let inquirers 
recur to all that he wrote before certain events took place in the world; and as to 
anything else that he may have said or done, would anyone believe his mere word 
if he made a sensational statement? Furthermore, one of the essential conditions 
of divination is not to be coerced, not to suffer temptation – in other words, not to 
be put to the test. Never have the masters of science yielded to the curiosity of 
anyone. The sibyls burned their books when Tarquin refused to appraise them at 
their proper value; the Great Master was silent when He was asked for a sign of

100 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
His Divine Mission; Agrippa perished of want rather than obey those who
demanded a horoscope. To furnish proofs of science to those who suspect the very
existence of science is to initiate the unworthy, to profane the gold of the sanctu-
ary, to deserve the excommunication of sages and the fate of betrayers.
 The essence of divination, that is to say, the Great Magical Arcanum, is repre-
sented by all the symbols of science, and is connected intimately with the one and
primeval doctrine of Hermes. In philosophy, it gives absolute certitude; in reli-
gion, the universal secret of faith; in physics, the composition, decomposition,
recomposition, realization and adaptation of Philosophical Mercury, called
AZOTH by the alchemists; in dynamics it multiplies our forces by those of perpet-
ual motion; it is at once mystical, metaphysical and material, with correspondent
effects in the three worlds; it procures charity in God, truth in science and gold in
riches, for metallic transmutation is at once an allegory and reality, as all the
adepts of true science are perfectly well aware. Yes, gold can be made really and
materially by means of the Stone of the Sages, which is an amalgam of Salt, Sul-
phur and Mercury, thrice combined in AZOTH by a triple sublimation and a triple
fixation. Yes, the operation is often easy and may be accomplished in a day, an
instant; at other times it requires months and years. But to succeed in the Great
Work, one must be divinus – a diviner, in the kabalistic sense of the term – and it
is indispensable to have renounced, in respect of personal interest, the advantage
of wealth, so as to become its dispenser. Raymund Lully enriched sovereigns,
planted Europe with instit utions and remained poor. Nicholas Flamel, who in
spite of his legend is really dead, only attained the Great Work when asceticism
had detached him completely from riches. He was initiated by a suddenly
imparted understanding of the book Aesh Mezareph, written in Hebrew by the
Kabalist Abraham, possibly the compiler of the Sepher Yetzirah. Now this under-
standing was for Flamel an intuition deserved, or rather, rendered possible, by the
personal preparations of the adept. I believe that I have spoken sufficiently.
 Divination is therefore an intuition, and the key of this intuition is the universal
and magical doctrine of analogies. By means of these analogies the Magus inter-
prets visions, as did the patriarch Joseph in Egypt, according to Biblical history.
The analogies in the reflections of the Astral Light are as exact as the shades of
colour in the solar spectrum, and can be calculated and explained with great
accuracy. It is, however, indispensable to know the dreamer's degree of intellec-
tual life, which, indeed, he will himself reveal completely by his own dreams and
in a manner that will astonish himself.
 Somnambulism, presentiments and second sight are simply an accidental or
induced disposition to dream in a voluntary or awakened sleep – that is, to per-
ceive the analogous reflections of the Astral Light, as we shall explain to demon-
stration in our “Ritual”, when providing the long-sought method of regularly
producing and directing magnetic phenomena. As to divinatory instruments, they



--------------------------------------- 119

 101
are simply a means of communication between diviner and consultant, serving 
merely to fix the two wills upon the same sign. Vague, complex, shifting figures 
help to focus reflections of the astral fluid, and it is thus that lucidity is procured 
by coffee-grouts, mists, the white of egg, etc., which evoke fatidic forms, existing 
only in the TRANSLUCID – that is, in the imagination of the operators. Vision in 
water is operated by the dazzlement and fatigue of the optic nerve, which then 
resigns its functions to the TRANSLUCID and produces a brain illusion, in which 
reflections of the Astral Light are taken for real images. Hence nervous persons, of 
weak sight and lively imagination, are best fitted for this species of divination, 
which indeed is most successful when exercised by children. Let us not misinter- 
pret, however, the function which we attribute to imagination in divinatory arts. It 
is by imagination assuredly that we see, and this is the natural aspect of the mira- 
cle; but we see true things, and in this consists the marvellous aspect of the natu- 
ral work. We appeal to the experience of all veritable adepts. The author of this 
book has tested every kind of divination, and has obtained results invariably in 
proportion to the exactitude of his scientific operations and the good faith of his 
consultants. 
 The Tarot, that miraculous work which inspired all the sacred books of antiq- 
uity, is the most perfect instrument of divination, by reason of the analogical pre- 
cision of its figures and numbers. It can be employed with complete confidence. 
Its oracles are always rigorously true, at least in a certain sense, and even when it 
predicts nothing it reveals secret things and gives the most wise counsel to its 
querents. Alliette, who, in the last century, from a hairdresser became a Kabalist, 
and kabalistically called himself Etteilla, reading his name backwards after the 
manner of Hebrew, Alliette, I say, after thirty years of meditation over the Tarot, 
was on the threshold of discovering everything that is concealed in this extraordi- 
nary work; but he ended only by misplacing the keys, through want of their 
proper understanding, and inverted the order and character of the figures, though 
without entirely destroying their analogies, so great are the sympathy and corre- 
spondence which exist between them. The writings of Etteilla, now very rare, are 
obscure, wearisome and barbarous in style; they have not all been printed, and 
some manuscripts of this father of modern cartomancers are in the hands of a 
Paris bookseller who has been good enough to let us examine them. Their most 
remarkable points are the obstinate perseverance and incontestable good faith of 
the author, who all his life perceived the grandeur of the occult sciences, but was 
destined to die at the gate of the sanctuary without ever penetrating behind the 
veil. He had little esteem for Agrippa, made much of Jean Belot and knew nothing 
of the philosophy of Paracelsus; but he possessed a highly-trained intuition and 
great persistence of will, though his fancy exceeded his judgement. His endow- 
ments were insufficient for a Magus and more than were needed for a skilful and 
accredited diviner of the vulgar order. Hence Etteilla had a fashionable success

which a more accomplished magician would perhaps have been wrong to
renounce, but assuredly would not have claimed.
 When delivering at the end of our “Ritual” a last message upon the Tarot, we
shall show the complete method of reading and hence of consulting it, not only on
the probable chances of destiny but also, and above all, upon problems of philos-
ophy and religion, concerning which it provides a solution as invariably certain as
it is admirable in its precision, if explained in the hierarchic order of the analogy
of the three worlds with the three colours and the four shades which compose the
sacred septenary. All this belongs to the positive practice of Magic, and can be
only indicated summarily and established theoretically in the present first part,
which is dedicated to the doctrine of Transcendental Magic and the philosophical
and religious key of the exalted sciences, known, or unknown rather, under the
name of occult.

 SUMMAR Y AND GENERAL KEY OF THE 
 FOUR SECRET SCIENCES 
 SIGNA TROT PAN 
LET us now summarize the entire science by its principles. Analogy is the final 
word of science and the first word of faith. Harmony consists in equilibrium, and 
equilibrium subsists by the analogy of contraries. Absolute unity is the supreme 
and final reason of things. Now, this reason can be neither one person nor three 
persons: it is a reason, and reason at the highest. To create equilibrium we must 
separate and unite – separate by the poles, unite by the centre. To reason upon 
faith is to destroy faith; to create mysticism in philosophy is to assail reason. Rea- 
son and faith, by their nature, mutually exclude one another, but they unite by 
analogy. Analogy is the sole possible mediator between finite and infinite. Dogma 
is the ever-ascending hypothesis of a presumable equation. For the ignorant, it is 
the hypothesis which is the absolute affirmation, and the absolute affirmation 
which is hypothesis. Hypotheses are necessary in science, and he who seeks to ver- 
ify them enlarges science without decreasing faith, for on the farther side of faith 
is the infinite. We believe in that which we do not know, but which reason leads us 
to admit. To define and circumscribe the object of faith is therefore to formulate 
the unknown. Professions of faith are formulations of the ignorance and aspira- 
tions of man. The theorems of science are monuments of his conquests. The man 
who denies God is not less fanatical than he who defines Him with pretended 
infallibility. God is commonly defined by the enumeration of all that He is not. 
Man makes God by an analogy from the lesser to the greater, whence it results 
that the conception of God by man is ever that of an infinite man who makes man 
a finite god. Man can realize that which he believes in the measure of that which 
he knows, by reason of that which he knows not, and he can accomplish all that 
he wills in the measure of that which he believes and by reason of that which he 
knows. The analogy of contraries is the relation of light and shade, of height and 
hollow, of plenum and void. Allegory, the mother of all dogmas, is the substitution 
of impressions for dies, of shadows for realities. It is the fable of truth and the 
truth of fable. One does not invent a dogma, one veils a truth, and a shade for 
weak eyes is produced. The initiator is not an impostor, he is a revealer, that is, 
following the meaning of the Latin word revelare, a man who veils afresh. He is 
the creator of a new shadow. 
 Analogy is the key of all secrets of Nature and the sole fundamental reason of 
all revelations. That is why religions seem to be written in the heavens and in all 
Nature, which is just as it should be, for the work of God is the book of God, the

104 The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic
expression of Whose thought should be seen in that which He writes, and so also
of His being, since we conceive Him only as supreme thought. Dupuis and Volney
saw only a plagiarism in this splendid correspondence, which should have led
them to acknowledge the catholicity, that is, the universality of the primeval, one,
magical, kabalistic and immutable doctri ne of revelation by analogy. Analogy
yields all forces of Nature to the Magus; analogy is the quintessence of the Philo-
sophical Stone, the secret of perpetual motion, the quadrature of the circle, the
Temple resting on the two pillars JAKIN and BOAZ, the key of the Great Arcanum,
the root of the Tree of Life, the science of good and evil. To find the exact scale of
correspondences in things appreciable by science is to fix the bases of faith and
thus become possessed of the rod of miracles. Now, there exists a principle and a
rigorous formula, which is the Great Arcanum. Let the wise man seek it not, since
he has already found it; let the profane seek for ever: they will never find.
 Metallic transmutation takes place spir itually and materially by the positive
key of analogies. Occult medicine is simply the exercise of the will applied to the
very source of life, to that Astral Light the existence of which is a fact, which has
a movement conformed to calculations having the Great Magical Arcanum for
their ascending and scale. This Universal Arcanum, the fi nal and eternal secret of
transcendent initiation, is represented in the Tarot by a naked girl, who touches
the earth only by one foot, has a magnetic rod in each hand, and seems to be run-
ning in a crown held up by an angel, an eagle, a bull and a lion. Fundamentally,
the figure is analogous to the cherub of Jekeskiel, of which a representation is
given, and to the Indian symbol of ADDA-NARI , which again is analogous to the
ADONAI of Jekeskiel, who is vulgarly called Ezekiel. The comprehension of this
figure is the key of all occult sciences. Readers of my book must already under-
stand it philosophically if they are at all familiar with the symbolism of the
Kabalah. It remains for us now to realize what is the second and more important
operation of the Great Work. It is something undoubtedly to find the Philosophi-
cal Stone, but how is it to be ground into the powder of projection? What are the
uses of the Magical Wand? What is the real power of the Divine Names in the
Kabalah? The initiates know, and those who are deserving of initiation will know
in turn if they discover the Great Arcanum by means of the very numerous and
precise indications which we have given them. Why are these simple and pure
truths for ever and of necessity concealed? Because the elect of intelligence are
always few on earth and are encompassed by the foolish and wicked, like Daniel
in the den of lions. Moreover, analogy instructs us in the laws of the hierarchy, and
absolute science, being an omnipotence, must be the exclusive possession of the
most worthy. The confusion of the hierarchy is the actual destruction of societies,
for then the blind become leaders of the blind, according to the word of the Mas-
ter. Give back initiation to priests and kings, and order will come forth anew. So,
in my appeal to the most worthy, and in exposing myself to all the dangers and

anathemas which threaten revealers, I believe myself to have done a great and 
useful thing, directing the breath of God living in humanity upon the social chaos, 
and creating priests and kings for the world to come 
 A thing is not just because God wills it, but God wills it because it is just, said 
the angel of the schools. It is as if he said: The Absolute is reason. Reason is 
self-existent; it is because it is, and not because we suppose it; it is, or nothing is; 
and how should one desire anything to exist apart from reason? Madness itself 
does not occur without it. Reason is necessity, is law, is the rule of all liberty and 
the direction of all initiative. If God exists, it is by reason. The conception of an 
absolute God outside or independent of rason is the idol ofe Black Magic and the 
phantom of the fiend. The demon is death masquerading in the tattered garments 
of life, the spectre of Hirrenkesept throned upon the rubbish of ruined civiliza- 
tions, and concealing a loathsome nakedness by the cast-off clothes of the incar- 
nations of Vishnu.
