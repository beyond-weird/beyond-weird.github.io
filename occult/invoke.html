Invocation to Frigg

When this invocation was first used, each person in a healing  circle invoked a
healer into (her/him)self.  This was my  invocation.  The rest of the circle
was asked to echo "Join us, Frigg" as I was saying "Join us. Frigg,". This was
my first  attempt at writing an invocation, and it DID work. I hope that it
also works for anyone else who wishes to use it, because it now feels like
time to share it.

 Blessed Be

This invocation is being reposted as part of a group of invocations, most of
which were patterned on this one. Permission is granted to use these
invocations in your own rituals. I do ask, however, that I get credit in any
copies of those rituals which are written or distributed.
