       PLANET MUSIC
       ------------
   by Noel-Anne Brennan

In dreams I see the trees
And hear them,
All leafy green-ness
Against the shaded blue of skies,
Whispering Earth-songs
To the changing light
With subtleties of color,
The flickered, leafy undersides
Of planet music,
The vibrant, fluid, windy songs.
But also there are harmonies of rock:
The song of quartz, the fire frozen,
The blood of Earth congealed,
The Cold flames clinging,
Remebersing heat,
The arrogant crystaline
Heart of the Land,
Stony chords
That sing in the bones of life,
The structure and framework
For melodies of air and seas and trees.
 
 
    HYMN TO THE EARTH
    -----------------
       by Mercurius

Blue marble in the solar sea,
Father Earth abides in me,
I am no more than His sweet child
And I must sojurn here awhile.
 
Blue marble with a lunar crown, 
Mother Earth turns to the dawn,
I sail across her starlit brine
And dream the dreams She plants in time.
 
Lord and Lady of the Quest,
Nuture hope in every breast,
Comfort those who suffer grief
And visit us in joy and peace.
 
Blue marble in our pantheon,
Planet of the human heart,
All my life is night and day,
Born to dance in Natures' sway.
 
Do what is best, no harm begat
That injures Goddess or the God,
Choose freely from the many paths
And honor Earth with works of praise.
 
Blue marble in the solar sea,
Father Earth abides in me,
Blue marble with a lunar crown,
Mother Earth turns to the dawn!


   TRIPLE GODDESS
   --------------
   by Gray Wolf
 
Goddess of our hopes and need,
You whom our desiures feed,
Hear our cry before the Moon,
Let our passions nightly swoon,
Earth is ours and Earth is Thine,
Let our pleasures be like wine,
Celebration of Your place
All bow down before Your face,
Hail to the Triple Goddess.
 
 
   CREATIONS
   ---------
   by Vashti Ayla Miria
 
I am daughter of Goddess
I am mother of Earth
I am sister of starlight
I am the New Moon of birth
I am the patterns
of space in the sky
I am the new furrowed ground
in which hallowed ones lie
I stay still for an instant
and Then like all I must "die"
'till I move to the center again
sweat out the tears of birth pain
sculptress of being I am
maker of creations within.
