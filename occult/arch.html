From:  Paul Hume
Subj:  Archangels

 Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
 For those who have expressed an interest, here are the images I use for
 the Archangels in the Quarters.  I trust not too badly mauled by the
 vagaries of the text processor available on my Apple II...
  
 Raphael:  Fair skin, blonde hair, delicate but strong features.
  Dressed in yellow robe shot with mauve threads.  He holds a Caduceus.
  Raphael stands lightly upon a spring-green field, wet with dew.  The
  rising Sun backlights him in pure, golden/white morning light.  His
  wings are white with gold highlights.
      
 Gabriel:  This is the one that may seem wierdest.   Sea-green hair,
  pale blue skin, in a scaled robe of blue with orange highlights.  His
  features are aquiline - classical Roman.  He bears a great Cup.  He
  stands above the billowing waves of the sea, backlit in Orange light
  by the setting Sun. His wings are white with blue-green highlights.
      
 Michael:  He stands in the desert, or sometimes a sun-baked field of
  bare soil, under the blazing noonday sun.  Red hair, golden-tan face,
  strong, square features.  Red metallic robe with green highlights
  flashing from it. He bears a great sword two-handed.  His arms and
  shoulders are those of a warrior.  Wings are coppery.
      
 Auriel:  Auriel stands on the mountains - black, silent, snowcapped -
  but looking down over a fertile valley, filled with crops and lowing
  cattle and bleating sheep.  He is dressed in simple robes, almost
  homespun, of the four Earth colors, russet predominating.  He bears a
  platter of the fruits of the soil, and I often see Him bearing a
  shepherd's crook or staff.  It is night yet cold, silver light
  illuminates the scene - whether from the Moon or "the midnight Sun" I
  cannot yet tell.  Auriel has dark hair, Mediterranean complexion, a
  half-round, half-square face with a pleasant smile.  His wings are
  dark - black with bluish highlights, like a raven's.
      
 Mostly, I just get a hint of the Archangelic image.  Instead, the Solar
  image of the Quarter (rising, setting, noonday, etc.) floods the
  circle with the appropriate color of light.  I also usually feel a
  breeze from Raphael, a humid tingling sensation from Gabriel,
  prickling heat from Michael, and solid, massive stability from Auriel.
  
 Hope these are of some use.  Love is the law, love under will.

 Paul
