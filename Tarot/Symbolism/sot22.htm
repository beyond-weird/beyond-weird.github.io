<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CARD XI.</H3>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">JUSTICE.</H1>
<P>When I possessed the keys, read the book and understood the symbols, I was permitted to lift the curtain of the Temple and enter. its inner sanctum. And there I beheld a Woman with a crown of gold and a purple mantle. She held a sword in one hand and scales in the other. I trembled with awe at her appearance, which was deep and mysterious, and drew me like an abyss.</P>
<P>"You see Truth," said the voice. "On these scales everything is weighed. This sword is always raised to guard justice, and nothing can escape it.</P>
<P>"But why do you avert your eyes from the scales and the sword? They will remove the last illusions. How could you live on earth without these illusions?</P>
<P>"You wished to see Truth and now you behold it! But remember what happens to the mortal who beholds a Goddess!"</P>
