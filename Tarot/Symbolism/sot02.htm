<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE MAGICIAN.</H1>
<P>I Saw the Man.</P>
<P>His figure reached from earth to heaven and was clad in a purple mantle. He stood deep in foliage and flowers and his head, on which was the head-band of an initiate, seemed to disappear mysteriously in infinity.</P>
<P>Before him on a cube-shaped altar were four symbols of magic--the sceptre, the cup, the sword and the pentacle.</P>
<P>His right hand pointed to heaven, his left to earth. Under his mantle he wore a white tunic girded with a serpent swallowing its tail.</P>
<P>His face was luminous and serene, and, when his eyes met mine, I felt that he saw most intimate recesses of my soul. I saw myself reflected in him as in a mirror and in his eyes I seemed to look upon myself.</P>
<P>And I heard a voice saying:</P>
<P>--"Look, this is the Great Magician!</P>
<P>With his hands he unites heaven and earth, and the four elements that form the world are controlled by him.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A></P>
<P>The four symbols before him are the four letters of the name of God, the signs of the four elements, fire, water, air, earth."</P>
<P>I trembled before the depth of the mysteries A touched... The words I heard seemed to be littered by the Great Magician himself, and it was as though he spoke in me.</P>
<P>I was in deep trepidation and at moment I felt there was nothing, before me except the blue sky; but within me a window opened through which I could see unearthly things. and hear unearthly words.</P>
