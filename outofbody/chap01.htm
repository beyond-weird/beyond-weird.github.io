<H1>CHAPTER 1 </H1></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H2>Background</H2></CENTER>
<P>I was born in Minneapolis Minnesota and spent the first 24 years of my life 
there. My childhood was normal except for a few unusual experiences that will be 
described later. 
<P>Before I started Kindergarten, met a boy named Brian, who was about three 
years older, and we became friends. Brian was a good friend, but he had a bad 
habit of lying. Brian felt that lying made him seem more knowledgeable and 
important than other kids, and he loved to be in that position of power. At that 
young age, I was naive and always asking questions, but I had no concept of 
dishonesty. Hanging around Brian, it didn't take me long to find out what a lie 
was. Before long, I didn't trust anything that Brian said to me. Still, Brian 
was my only friend and there were no other kids my age in the area. Instead of 
abandoning our friendship, I took it as a challenge. I still valued his 
friendship, but I had to learn to separate the fact from the fiction. I was 
forced to use logic to tell when he was lying and when he was telling the truth. 
Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn't. But I got better at it by 
verifying some of the facts with grownups I knew I could trust. 
<P>Before too long, my parents intervened and told me I couldn't see Brian again 
because he was a "bad influence." They were right. But Brian's friendship taught 
me some valuable lessons when I was at an impressionable age. First, I learned 
that you can't believe everything you hear or read. I gained a real appreciation 
for the "truth" and I learned to question everything. Second, I learned how to 
use reason, deduction and logic. My love of the truth turned into a love for 
scientific knowledge, an insatiable curiosity, and a thirst for knowledge and 
exploration. 
<P>When I entered grade school, I made my first important discovery: The school 
library. Most of the kids would run to the fiction section to grab the story 
books. I would run to the shelf marked "SCIENCE" and I'd read text books. I 
would read any book as long as it was scientific: dinosaurs, biology, lasers, 
botany, archaeology, astronomy and anything else that crossed my curious mind in 
a particular week. Even before I could read I would learn by looking at the 
pictures. 
<P>My mom used to take me to the public library and let me wander around while 
she picked out books. Of course, I'd go straight for the science books there 
too. But in the public library, children's books were mostly story books. So I 
would wander around the adult section and look for science books. I remember one 
day when I stumbled into the anatomy section of the adult books. I wonder what 
my parents would have said if they found out I knew all about sex and the 
reproductive system at the age of six! I remember arguing with other 
six-year-olds about where babies came from. They insisted on storks and 
cabbage-patches, and I just couldn't talk any sense into them. 
<P>I got a reputation for being a "know it all" or a "brain." I didn't care for 
that status at all, because people couldn't relate to a "brain" and everyone 
resents a "know-it-all." I did my best to fight against my reputation, and stuck 
to a small group of friends. 
<P>In high school I became interested in the field of computers and my curiosity 
led me to study computers in my spare time. I took several computer 
short-courses offered by the University of Minnesota. After I had taken every 
short-course the University had to offer, I spent my free time reading computer 
manuals and writing computer games. My face became well known in the University 
computer labs. I often chuckled when people twice my age would ask me for help 
on their programming class assignments. 
<P>After high school, I entered the University of Minnesota majoring in the 
field of Computer Science. During that time I started having Out-of-Body 
Experiences (OBEs), and it changed the course of my life. Perhaps it can change 
your life too!

<H2>EXERCISE 1</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Affirmations</H3></CENTER>
<P>This "exercise" section, which appears at the end of each chapter, is 
designed to present exercises and pointers to readers who are interested in 
learning to have out-of-body experiences. The exercises will be simple in the 
early chapters and get more complicated in later chapters. 
<P>This particular exercise is an affirmation. An affirmation is like a New 
Year's resolution; something you say to yourself to strengthen your ability to 
do something. It's not enough just to say the affirmation, you should think 
about it first, then say it slowly to yourself a few times. Each time you say an 
affirmation, you should try to put emotion behind your words and actually 
believe what you are saying. 
<P>Affirmations work for many reasons. First, it's a way to clearly communicate 
with your subconscious, and we all know how powerful the subconscious is from 
hypnosis studies. 
<P>Second, many people in metaphysics believe in a higher consciousness, 
sometimes called your "Higher Self," or "Oversoul," which is even more powerful 
than your subconscious. Affirmations also allow you to communicate your 
intentions to your Oversoul which can help you reach your goals. 
<P>Third, many people in metaphysics believe that your beliefs directly affect 
your experience. Affirmations make it easier to change your belief-system, and 
make positive changes in your life. 
<P>The most effective affirmations are the kind you make for yourself. They 
should be short, succinct and stated in a positive way. For example, use "I 
want" messages instead of "I don't want" messages. State the changes you want in 
your life and what you are willing to do to make it real. For this exercise, you 
should do affirmations based on your want to have OBEs. You can either create 
your own affirmation or use the one given below: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>I want to have out-of-body experiences. I want to leave my body. I know 
  that the Universe will respond to my needs and wants quickly, efficiently and 
  joyously. In return, I will practice OBE exercises, cooperate with the 
  Universe, follow my impulses, act on my intuitions, share my knowledge, spread 
  my love and cooperate with my own Higher Self. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
