<H1>CHAPTER 18 </H1></CENTER>

<H2>Fight for Sight</H2></CENTER>
<P>Scientific experimenters were quick to discover that OBE eyesight is 
different from physical eyesight. They set up a simple experiment: They placed 
an object inside a locked room. The subject was supposed to fly into that room 
and identify the object. The experiment sounds easy enough, but the subjects had 
problems identifying the objects. The most proficient subjects, such as Ingo 
Swann and Keith ("Blue") Harary could make drawings of what they saw during OBE 
experiments. Often the drawings were unrecognizable, or at best distorted. For 
example, in one experiment part of the "target" was an American flag. Ingo Swann 
made a very impressive and accurate drawing of the target. However, the flag was 
drawn as a rectangle with a box in one corner and stripes on the rest of the 
rectangle. Ingo seemed to see the flag with some clarity, but was unable to 
identify it as an American flag. Why do such distortions exist? 
<P>In an attempt to tell whether some sort of clairvoyance was involved during 
OBEs, parapsychologists devised an ingenious experiment. They built an optical 
box that was computer- controlled. The computer would choose a random colors, 
quadrants, and patterns. The colors and patterns were displayed in the chosen 
quadrant. The displayed image could only be identified if the subject was 
standing in a certain position in front of the box, where he or she could 
interpret the superimposed images as a single image. The complexity of the 
superimposed visual images was meant to rule out clairvoyance. This experiment 
had a very small rate of success, but sometimes the target was "seen," as if the 
subject was actually viewing the box from outside his or her body. But this 
experiment also had many problems with the eyesight being distorted. Again, why 
is this? 
<P>I believe the distortions in astral eyesight are partly due to the fact that 
the astral body isn't equipped with eyes which process light. Astral eyes are 
more for appearance than function. Therefore, the physical brain is forced to 
give physical interpretations to nonphysical "images." Many of my experiments 
were devoted to exploring the astral equivalent of eyesight. 
<H3>I. The different types of sight:</H3>
<P>I've experienced four basic types of sight during my out-of-body experiences. 
I call them astral sight, body-sight, mind-sensing and clairvoyance. Of course, 
there is a fifth category: no sight at all. OBEs can sometimes be very difficult 
to describe because during the experience you may have switched several times 
among the four types of sight. One moment you might be mind-sensing, and the 
next minute you use your astral-sight to look at a particular object, and so on. 

<H4>A. Astral Sight</H4>
<P>Astral sight is best explained as the astral equivalent of physical sight. A 
good example is OBE #52 in chapter 10. This type of sight is closer to 
in-the-body physical sight than the other types. With this type of sight, 
objects seen while out of the body may look just like they do while in the body. 
This is the most desirable type of sight because it is easier for the physical 
brain to interpret the images seen during the OBE. The sight is focused at the 
astral body's eyes and objects usually appear solid. Usually I have to make a 
special effort to employ this type of sight, and I've noticed that my peripheral 
vision isn't very good. Here is an example from my journals: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>01/25/81 Sun - OBE #31 
  <P>...Now I was fully conscious. I remembered my sight problem, and decided to 
  look at my waving arm, not sure if it was physical or astral. I looked over, 
  and I saw my arm waving. It seemed to be physical sight. I felt sure I was in 
  my physical body, trying to push myself out. Then I blacked out and woke up in 
  my physical body and found out I had been wrong. I wasn't in my physical body 
  when I thought I was. My physical arm was wedged between my legs, so the arm I 
  saw waving was my astral arm. I had been seeing the astral counterpart of the 
  physical world.... </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The following example illustrates another important point: eyesight (among 
other things) is affected by our beliefs and our thoughts. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>02/23/80 - OBE #9 
  <P>...I looked up about 30 degrees and I didn't see my bookshelf, etc. I saw a 
  gray area, almost as if it were a time-tunnel, like the old television show. 
  But it was like a gray cloud.... The strangest thing I find about the astral 
  plane is how astral sight works. It's like a truer "tunnel vision." You see 
  only where you look, and then only what you expect or want to see. I didn't 
  see any of the surroundings of my physical room. For example, I didn't see my 
  dressers or bookshelf, but I could see my own astral body when I expected to 
  see it. OBE #5 also involved the strange sense of sight. [During that 
  experience] I saw the physical pillow, hand, etc., but not my astral hands. 
  When I wanted to see what they were doing, I looked out in front, and slowly 
  the VISION of them swaying gently back and forth FADED IN. They slowly got 
  clearer until I could recognize that they were my hands.... </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>B. Astral Mind-Sensing</H4>
<P>Astral mind-sensing is the type of eyesight that I've experienced most often 
during my OBEs. This isn't much like true eyesight at all. You can't actually 
"see" things, but you can "feel" with your mind where everything is. This type 
of sight isn't centered around astral eyes. Objects are "felt" in all directions 
simultaneously, by the whole focus of consciousness. This type of sight is very 
hard to interpret or describe in physical terms. With this type of sight, you 
can flawlessly navigate a cluttered room but not "see" any particular object in 
the room. Here are a few examples: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>08/15/80 - OBE #21 
  <P>Sometime during the night I woke up in my astral body, gently swaying 
  inside the physical body. I swayed myself and was mildly surprised when my 
  consciousness swayed too. So I swayed myself harder until my astral feet 
  touched the ground....I decided to try to wake up my mother. So I struggled 
  against the pull of my cord and walked through my door. I went down the 
  kitchen hall and into my parents' bedroom. I saw both of their bodies sleeping 
  there. My dad's body was talking in his sleep. I looked again to see if their 
  bodies glowed from their aura. I didn't notice any glow. I decided to wake my 
  mother up. So I reached out and tried to rouse her by shaking her while 
  saying, "Wake up, Ma." She finally woke up and looked but didn't see me. I 
  tried to get her attention but she finally got up and walked through me!.... 
  <P>Again, my vision [had been] funny; I had thought to look to see if I could 
  see the glow of their auras, and had made a special effort to "look" at their 
  bodies. I couldn't really see, but I could sense things with my mind, sort of 
  like radar. I could feel the presences of things always, but had to make a 
  special effort to "see" with eyes. I realized that at the time, and I made a 
  special effort to "look" so I could bring back a clear memory when I came 
  back; the mind-vision must be very hard to translate into physical terms by 
  the brain. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>C. Body Sight</H4>
<P>Body sight is very annoying. I never read about it happening, nor did I think 
it was possible until I experienced it. This happens when you try to open your 
astral eyes and your physical eyes open instead, giving you a completely 
different and confusing perspective. With this type of sight, you can only see 
in the direction that the body's eyes are pointing. It is often out of focus. 
This resembles split-consciousness, except that your consciousness is still 
fully within the astral body. Here are a few examples from my journals: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>11/29/80 Sat - OBE #27 
  <P>...I was out of my body, floating about four feet away from it. I realized 
  at once that I couldn't see, so I made an effort to open my eyes. At that 
  exact moment, for a split-second I had dual-consciousness! I felt my physical 
  body had opened its eyes! While at the same time I was floating above the 
  body, looking down! In other words, I was plainly in my astral body, and I was 
  looking down, but what I saw was from my physical body looking up! I got 
  really confused, was shocked, surprised, whatever, and then I lost 
  consciousness and started dreaming.... </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>12/17/80 Wed - OBE #29 
  <P>...I was falling asleep when I noticed that I had two sets of arms! I had a 
  lot of control, but my consciousness was not too good. I forced myself down 
  under my bed. I couldn't see anything, nor was I "mind-sensing." But I could 
  feel my [astral] body fine, and I knew where I was. I immediately drew myself 
  up to the ceiling. I didn't propel myself up there, nor did I exactly "think" 
  myself up there. I just drew myself up to the ceiling in what seemed like a 
  natural manner. I still couldn't see. I tried to open my eyes, but it once 
  again seemed as if my physical eyes opened, and I saw from my body's 
  viewpoint. I recognized the danger of this (I might have gotten confused like 
  OBE #27). So I closed my eyes again. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>01/24/81 Sat - OBE #30 
  <P>...I was...about three inches below my physical body. I opened my eyes, 
  and, although my astral self was swaying, my vision was not! I noticed that my 
  sight was normal, and not the usual distorted astral vision, and I wondered 
  why. Then it came to me. Once again, I was seeing through my physical eyes! 
  This has happened before, but now I decided to investigate the matter further. 
  It didn't make sense that I was seeing through my physical body's eyes. I 
  decided to try to figure it out. I reached out my (astral) hand in front of me 
  and my face. I looked through my physical eyes, and saw nothing but the 
  ceiling and the overhead light. My physical body wasn't seeing my astral arm, 
  which I plainly felt as being right in front of my physical eyes. I didn't 
  feel any discomfort, but I thought my physical eyes had been open a long time, 
  and they needed blinking. So I blinked them, and it was a normal blink. I did 
  it again. When I blinked, for that split-second, it seemed as though my astral 
  head floated up to meet my physical head. Then when I blinked I felt my head 
  as being physical, although my astral legs were still dangling. Well, I 
  decided that it would remain a mystery. I decided to go do something, so I 
  pulled myself up about five feet above my body. I also closed my eyes so they 
  wouldn't disturb me.... </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>D. Clairvoyance</H4>
<P>"Clairvoyance" is the term I use to define a whole grab-bag of different 
types of sight, such as seeing auras and receiving images of people and places 
that aren't present. I believe that "remote-viewing" mainly uses this type of 
sight, which used to be called "traveling clairvoyance" years ago. I believe 
anyone can learn to use this type of sight, whether out of the body or in, with 
practice. Here are a few examples from my OBE journals: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>10/24/81 Sat - OBE #52 
  <P>...I was off to another excursion. When I got out, I was about one foot 
  above my body. I sat up. I knew what I must do. I had to get to LD's house 
  somehow. I thought to myself, "I know there are two possible routes I could 
  take, either the back door or out through my window." But I heard the back 
  door open and shut. I directed my attention over there, and my clairvoyant 
  vision opened up. I saw that it was my mom coming in from outside. I also 
  noticed the clock in the kitchen, but it was too blurry to see the time. I 
  remember that it was more like second-sight or clairvoyant vision.... 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>05/15/82 Sat - OBE #73 
  <P>...I looked down at my swaying legs, but all I saw was my bed. I saw no 
  legs. I thought, "Well, now is the best time to practice clairvoyant vision 
  because I know what to look for [my legs]." So I half closed my astral eyes, 
  and put them out of focus. I experimented with my eyes, and finally after 
  about six tries I found how to hold my eyes so that they would get the 
  clearest clairvoyant sight [of my legs]. I cannot possibly describe any more 
  how I used my eyes to see that way; it is something that can only be gained 
  through experimenting. Anyway, I was seeing clairvoyantly, and I clearly saw 
  two identical sets of legs. One set [the physical] was resting on the bed. The 
  other set [the astral] was swaying up and down, and the physical bed wasn't 
  affecting it in the least. I feel now that I was actually using clairvoyant 
  sight or "second sight" because I noticed a difference between it and the 
  usual astral sight. The astral sight I am used to usually doesn't give me 
  great detail. In this projection I saw my legs, the pajamas I was wearing, and 
  the exact design on those pajamas. Ordinarily when I look at my legs astrally 
  I either see them as bare legs, or I see clothing vaguely. In this [mode of] 
  vision I also noticed many other details. The neatest thing was being able to 
  see both sets of legs there. Both sets of legs looked semi-transparent, and I 
  could distinguish color very well. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>07/25/82 Sun - OBE #80 
  <P>...I looked at my [astral] arms, not astrally, but clairvoyantly, as if 
  trying to see a spirit from the physical world. My [astral] arms were 
  transparent when I looked at them that way. They looked like transparent, dark 
  black filmy shadows. I studied them for a while, then blacked out. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>II. Peculiarities of Sight.</H3>
<P>Astral travelers have always reported differences between the physical world 
and the OBE world. For instance, a door that is closed physically might appear 
open while out of the body. Why are there differences? The most common 
explanation is that we aren't really seeing the physical world: We are seeing 
the astral counterpart of the physical world. It is said that the astral world 
is very plastic and when left alone, it molds itself to the shape of physical 
objects. I've also seen some peculiar things while out of the body: 
<H4>A. Seeing the physical body. </H4>
<P>What is it we're seeing while we're out of the body? If we're seeing only the 
astral counterpart of physical objects, it follows that we should not be able to 
see our own body. After all, we are already using the astral body. I haven't 
looked at my physical body much during OBEs, but when I do it usually looks like 
a blob of gray. However, it hasn't always appeared as I expect: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>04/27/80 - OBE #15 
  <P>Sometime this morning I found myself conscious out of my body, but very 
  near it. My first instincts were to get away from it. So when I thought about 
  getting away, I drifted down, through my bed underneath my body. I could feel 
  the bed as I went through it. I saw my body through the bed as a body-shaped 
  mass of gray matter. I thought, "No, I don't want to go down. I want to go 
  up." Then I drifted up above my body to the ceiling. I started to drift 
  through the ceiling, and I could feel the layers go through my arms and head. 
  It was so strange! 
  <P>When I was halfway through the ceiling, I was sensing things with my mind 
  and not using my astral sense of sight. I thought, "I'm supposed to see what's 
  up here (above my room)." So I quickly turned my head to look, saw some stuff 
  like a dresser flash by my sight and the next thing I knew I was back in my 
  body. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>01/31/81 Sat - OBE #33 
  <P>...I could see okay on the astral plane. I was in the high-vibration state, 
  swaying. I was also about five inches below my physical body. My physical body 
  from the astral plane looked like a ghost might on the physical plane. It 
  looked to me to be a transparent shell in the shape of a man, with nothing in 
  the middle.... </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>01-15-84 Sun - OBE #101 
  <P>...At that time I realized that my eyes were closed and I really wasn't 
  seeing anything at all. My vision was totally dark. So I opened my astral eyes 
  and turned around to look back at my body. The room looked normal. I could see 
  everything in it. I looked at my bed and it looked just like it should: all 
  messed up. But there wasn't a body on it that I could see! I tried squinting, 
  but I still didn't see my body. I did notice that the bed linen was flattened, 
  as if there was some object on it, but the object was totally and completely 
  invisible. I thought, "Oh that's interesting. I wonder why I can't see it." I 
  closed my eyes and tried to turn on clairvoyance. I could barely mind-sense my 
  body as a filmy, gray shadow on the bed. I just thought, "Hm. Oh well," and 
  decided to go do something.... </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>B. Astral clouds.</H4>
<P>During several experiences I noticed clouds of gray hanging in midair. I 
still don't know what they are or why they exist. It seems to be undefined 
astral matter. 
<H4>C. Astral lights.</H4>
<P>During a few OBEs I noticed a strange light that I could not explain. As far 
as I know, this is not common in OBEs, but many people have reported seeing 
similar lights during near-death experiences (NDEs). Here are some examples from 
my journals: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>12/20/79 Thu - OBE #4 
  <P>...strong vibrations came. I stayed calm. They "took over." I came out of 
  my body about four feet away. I saw a bright light to the west. I was halfway 
  through my wall between my bedroom and the living room. I looked back and saw 
  my body. I was then slowly drawn toward it. I thought, "No! I'm not done! I 
  want to go to JP's house! I want to go to JP and CA! I want to go!". I was 
  sucked partially in my body. I kept part of me out. I could move both bodies 
  (astral and physical). My arms were astral, but my eyes were both astral and 
  physical! I waved my left arm right in front of my face and looked through my 
  physical eyes. I couldn't see them! I could feel them there but I couldn't see 
  them. I wanted to see them, so suddenly I did. I could partially move my other 
  limbs. I decided to go back [and end the experience].... </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>03/07/82 Sun - OBE #66 
  <P>...I looked and I saw a tiny, but concentrated, pinpoint of bright light to 
  the West, and up a little bit. I was intrigued by it, and I stared at it. It 
  didn't seem to be a physical light. I tried focusing my eyes in a number of 
  different ways to try to see it more clearly. I tried to look at it with 
  physical sight, astral sight, mind-sensing, and many other forms of sight. I 
  tried to magnify it in my vision. I don't know why I was so fascinated with 
  it. I started staring at it almost hypnotically. I wondered if it had anything 
  to do with my body, or if I was waking up. Then I felt my consciousness slowly 
  transported back to my physical body and I was still quite loose from my body. 
  I started swaying again, but I felt all of my senses come slowly back to my 
  body. The swaying became slower and slower, then finally stopped, and I came 
  to. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>D. Misc.</H4>
<P>Sometimes I've seen things that didn't make any sense: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>06/27/82 Sun - OBE #76 
  <P>...My eyes opened and I astrally saw a very blurry sight that did not make 
  sense. This lasted for a split-second, and it was followed by another picture 
  that was very clear, but it was very short in duration. This second sight 
  [vision] looked like a square rainbow, or a square representation of the 
  spectrum of light. I could see nothing but gray around this box of colors. In 
  this box, leftmost, was a bigger block of pure black. To the right of the 
  black portion were six or so other colors that were either in the order of the 
  rainbow (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-violet) or in reverse order 
  (violet-blue-green-yellow-orange-red). I remember it clearly. This box of 
  colors was to the right [side] of my field of vision. Anyway, this vision 
  faded, and I again saw the blurry first vision. Then I felt a tremendous 
  electrical shock hit my system, as if I stuck my finger in a light socket and 
  received a full 110-volt electrical shock. This shock hit every cell of my 
  body and I was slammed back to my body. My heart was beating wildly, beyond 
  control, as if the shock was physical.... </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Through practice, it is possible to learn to control out-of-body vision. I 
recommend you experiment with the different types of sight to see what works 
best for you. I recommend using a form of sight that can be expressed in 
physical terms when you return to your body and want to record the experience. 
<H3>III. Objectivity of Sight</H3>
<P>Many books on out-of-body experiences claim that OBEs are completely 
controlled by our thoughts, beliefs, expectations and wishes. But if this is 
true, how "real" is it? Where does it fit in with our experience of the "real" 
or "objective" world? If you leave your body and travel to Jupiter, and believe 
the planet is blue instead of orange, will you see a blue Jupiter or an orange 
one? In either case, are you really seeing the "real" planet, or one which was 
created in your mind? This is a very perplexing question that deserves more 
attention. 
<P>There are many people who have reported OBEs in which they saw things that 
really did happen. The most common of these are the descriptions by patients 
undergoing surgery, who claim to have witnessed the whole procedure from outside 
their body. Some have reported details of the procedure that they could not have 
possibly known, such as where the doctors put gall stones that were removed. 
Some patients have accurately repeated conversations that went on during the 
surgery. Skeptics may dismiss such cases by theorizing that some subconscious 
part of the patient still had cognitive abilities during the operation, and 
assuming that somehow the patient accessed this subconscious memory when they 
awoke. This theory cannot explain the less common cases where OBE subjects have 
reported what was happening in a different room. These seem to suggest that the 
subject could actually see some part of physical reality. 
<P>There are also many cases where people saw things during an OBE that didn't 
correspond to the physical world. For instance, take the following OBE: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>12/21/85 Sat - OBE #119 
  <P>I brought myself down into the proper mental state, very easily, and I got 
  out of my body using an older technique: I waited for a certain feeling in the 
  pit of my stomach, moved my consciousness down to my abdomen, then lifted 
  myself straight up at that place, and out of the body. It all happened very 
  quickly and it seemed ridiculously easy at the time. 
  <P>I was in midair floating about two feet above my physical body. I turned to 
  my left (South), and raised myself into a standing position. I looked at the 
  North wall, and briefly considered whether to walk through it. I decided 
  against it. 
  <P>I took a few steps toward the back of the bedroom, to the West. I felt a 
  bit giddy and off balance. Then I took a few steps East, toward the bedroom 
  door again. I felt unsure of my footing, and I assumed it was because I was 
  too close to my physical body. I decided that I had to get farther away from 
  my body, and the safest way to do that was to crawl on my hands and knees. 
  <P>I got down on my hands and knees, and crawled toward the bedroom door, 
  crawled through the bedroom door, and out into the living room. I crawled 
  about six feet more until I was in the middle of the living room, and then 
  stood up again, and walked over toward the kitchen. 
  <P>I looked into the kitchen, and it looked different. At the time I was 
  standing partially through the microwave oven stand, but I didn't notice it, 
  nor any of the other nearby objects in the room. I looked toward the 
  countertop right of the sink, and there was no countertop! It appeared as if 
  someone had cut out the countertop at the sink, all the way back to the wall, 
  and the wall looked somewhat dirty. It looked as if whoever cut the countertop 
  out did a very sloppy job. I scanned the area up and down, and finally I said 
  to myself, "It's an illusion; I know the kitchen isn't like this, but that's 
  not important." 
  <P>I walked back into the living room, stopped by JH's computer, and suddenly 
  I became very excited. I said aloud (or so it seemed), "This is great! I'm 
  completely lucid! This is entirely real!" I examined my own consciousness, and 
  it was very clear, bright, lucid, and normal in every respect.... 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Why are there discrepancies between the physical and nonphysical worlds? Some 
people claim that astral matter is easily malleable, and imitates physical 
objects, but not completely. Others claim it's because some OBEs occur in the 
"astral plane" which is influenced by our beliefs and expectations. Or perhaps 
the people who find themselves in a thought-influenced, subjective OBE state are 
really having Lucid Dreams. 
<P>Another theory is that some people have a kind of "clairvoyance" which allows 
them to see the physical world during an OBE, much like a clairvoyant can see 
spirits while in the body. Again, more research is needed to answer these 
questions.

<CENTER>
<H2>EXERCISE 18</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Rocking Chair Visualization</H3></CENTER>
<P>This is a variation of the previous exercise. 
<P>Before you attempt the exercise, sit in a rocking chair, close your eyes and 
rock. Memorize the feeling of rocking with your eyes closed. This is how you 
should feel when you are doing the exercise. 
<P>You can do this either laying down or sitting. First, close your eyes and 
relax. As vividly as you can, imagine that you're sitting in a rocking-chair, 
rocking gently forward and backward. Take your time doing this. In this 
exercise, it's not important to visualize at all. As a matter of fact, you can 
completely ignore any visual images that come to mind. In previous exercises, I 
wanted you to vividly pretend you were seeing images, like the yoyo exercise in 
chapter 9. This time, I want you to vividly imagine the feeling of rocking back 
and forth. Keep at it until it seems as if your consciousness is really rocking. 

<P>Once again, this is more than just a silly exercise. I've used this imaginary 
feeling of rocking to leave my body. Actually, I used a slight variation, which 
went as follows: Some good movie-theaters have seats like a rocking-chair, but 
they have very tight springs. The tight springs make them more "springy" than 
regular rocking chairs, and they rock very quickly. Anyway, I would imagine I 
was sitting in one of these springy theater seats and start rocking. Pretty soon 
the vibrations would come, and I'd use the momentum to catapult away from the 
body. 
<P>Again, this exercise is very important. It's probably more effective for me 
than some of the other exercises, because it deals directly with feelings and 
bodily sensations instead of visualizations or imaginary sounds.
