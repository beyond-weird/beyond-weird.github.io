<H2>Psychic Experiences</H2></CENTER>
<P>As I continued to practice out-of-body experiences, I had more and more 
psychic experiences. And I was trying to deny it all. I didn't consider myself 
psychic, but psychic experiences kept piling up, one upon another, forcing me to 
admit that I had psychic abilities. What's more, psychic things happened so 
often that I couldn't write it off as coincidence. I felt as if my "higher self" 
was combating my skepticism by throwing undeniable, unbelievable things in my 
face. 
<P>I had many different types of psychic experiences. Remarkable, it all seemed 
to happen over night. As crazy as it sounded, wishes started coming true. 
Suddenly the world was magical. 
<H3>Telepathy:</H3>
<P>Suddenly I was "taking the words out of people's mouths," not weekly or 
daily, but hourly! I wrote some of these down in my journals. Here are some 
examples: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>05/12/80 Mon 
  <P>...I asked my mom what we had for lunch. The word "tuna fish" came to me. A 
  while later she said, "There might be some tuna fish around." </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>05/20/80 
  <P>Today JF and I were talking about how neat it would be if BS (our English 
  teacher) was also our computer-science teacher. I THOUGHT, "What was BS's 
  major in college?". JF suddenly SAID, "He was a physics major." 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>10/14/83 Fri 
  <P>...For one of my classes this quarter, I am in a team of five people 
  working on a computer project. Today we had to think of a name for our team. I 
  suggested the name "Magnum Opus," and right away one of my teammates said he 
  had just been thinking that, and was about to suggest it himself! 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>10/04/85 Fri 
  <P>...I was programming busily, when I thought I heard JP ask about my 
  computer program (if I fixed my ENDIF statements in a particular section of 
  code). I started explaining to him that I did, and what else I had done, when 
  he told me that he never asked the question! He only THOUGHT about asking me! 
  And yet I answered him as if he asked the question he had in his mind. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Telepathic Sending</H3>
<P>This is similar to telepathy, except you are deliberately trying to send a 
message to another person. Another term might be "Remote Suggestion." This is 
the ability to put thoughts or suggestions into the minds of others. A good 
example was the incident in which I suggested that my bus driver speed up. Here 
are more examples: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>08/20/80 Wed 
  <P>I went to Burger King for lunch. With my lunch I ordered some french fries. 
  When the server went to get my fries, I telepathed, "Give me a few more." 
  Right before my eyes, she turned around, reached in the bin and added more 
  fries to my order! The french fries were already measured into bags. But she 
  grabbed a bag and afterward she added some to my bag of fries! I said aloud, 
  "I don't believe it!" </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>03/19/81 Thu 
  <P>...I was eating supper with my Dad and I wanted a napkin. I decided to do a 
  psychic experiment. I tried to put the word "Napkin" into my Dad's mind. A 
  little while later, he reached up and grabbed a napkin for me. That's not too 
  strange. But then he asked, "Were you just thinking 'Napkin'?" Then I told him 
  about my experiment. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>10/21/85 Mon 
  <P>...PF is a local computer dealer. During the previous week, he had ordered 
  some computers from our company. He never went through with his order, and all 
  of us wanted DB to call PF and ask him about his order. DB didn't want to call 
  PF back. At a particular time in the day, I said to everyone, "Since DB 
  doesn't want to call PF, we'll have to get PF to call us!" JS asked, "How are 
  we going to do that?" I replied, "Well, we'll think about him really hard, and 
  then he'll pick up on it and call us." Amused, JS said, "Okay." A few minutes 
  later, PF called, after about a week of not hearing from him. JS said, "It 
  worked!" </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Clairvoyance</H3>
<P>Clairvoyance is when we perceive something out of the range of our senses. 
For instance, it was common for me to "know" what song was playing on the radio 
before I turned it on, or to "hear" the next song to be played, before the 
current song was over. It was common for me to brush these experiences off as 
"coincidence" to a certain point, but when these coincidences started stacking 
up, I started writing them down in my journals. I couldn't ignore them any 
longer. 
<P>This ability was very helpful. Often I knew when the telephone would ring. 
Sometimes I would also know who was calling, which helped me avoid people I 
didn't want to talk to. In playing cards, I would "know" which card was best for 
me to play, without knowing or needing to know what the other players had. 
Sometimes I had fun with this ability. Here is an example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>05/31/84 Thu 
  <P>...I was talking with my friend and fellow programmer, WB, about names. He 
  said, "I bet you could never guess my middle name it's so strange." I calmly 
  said, "Otto," and he said "Wow! How did you know? I never told that to anyone, 
  and it isn't on my job application or W-4 forms either!" Then he said, "But I 
  got another middle name, but you'd never guess this other one in a million 
  years." I calmly said, "Garhard?" to which he replied, "How did you know that? 
  That's not a common name!" I just said "Just a guess," to which he replied, "I 
  don't believe it!" </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Visions</H3>
<P>Although this is similar to clairvoyance, I list it separately because there 
is a difference: With clairvoyance, I just seemed to "know" things out of the 
reach of my senses, but with visions I saw clear-as-day pictures in front of me. 
I had to draw my own conclusions from those visions. Here's an example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>05/06/80 Tue 
  <P>A couple of weeks ago, I was going to sleep one night and ...suddenly I saw 
  a vision. In the vision I saw a very clear picture of my Aunt K. laying down 
  with her eyes closed. I knew she wasn't dead, but asleep or passed-out in the 
  vision. When it was over I got out of bed, and walked to the living room where 
  my mom was reading. I asked her, "How is Aunt K?" She said, "Why?" I told her 
  of my vision and she said that she hadn't talked to Aunt K. for a long time. 
  <P>Last Friday I heard the story. Aunt K. was in bed one night when she fell 
  out of bed. When she fell, she hit her head, and for a while she was blinded. 
  Now she is out of the hospital after days, and she is recovering her sight. 
  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As close as I can tell, the vision took place on or near the day of her 
accident. 
<H3>Psychic Dreams</H3>
<P>I discovered that dreams can be a source of psychic information. On 08/02/81, 
I had a dream that started normally: I was at the University bookstore. Then the 
dream took on a strange quality, and I was paged to come to the information 
desk. At the information desk, a lady handed me a telephone. A woman's voice 
told me I should come home because there had been a death in my family. I asked 
the woman who had died, but she said she couldn't tell me; all she could tell me 
was the person's social security number over the phone. When she told me the 
social security number, I "knew" it was my father who had "died" in my dream. I 
was shocked and sad, so I consciously decided to end the dream (which led me to 
an OBE). My father was in perfect health, but not for long. This was the first 
"warning" I was given about my father's death. 
<H3>Precognition</H3>
<P>Precognition could also be classified as clairvoyance, but instead of the 
ability to "know" the present, this is the ability to "know" the future. On 
November 2, 1981, I had a certain "feeling" or "knowing" that my father was soon 
to die. I wrote it down, but I didn't tell anyone my feeling. My father was 
still in good health. Soon after that, my dad became ill and died on January 13, 
1982. A better example of precognition is the following: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>11/26/80 Wed 
  <P>I took a 94B bus home from work today. On the bus ride to downtown 
  Minneapolis, I thought about many things, but the main thought that kept 
  nagging me the whole way home was: "I'd better relax more, in case we get in 
  an accident." I would feel the need for relaxation, then I would realize I was 
  tense, then I would relax again. When I'd tense up again, I'd tell myself to 
  relax again, and so on. The thoughts kept nagging me until I decided to pursue 
  them. I thought about the prospect of my bus getting in an accident. I kept 
  reassuring myself, "No way could it happen." But the thought nagged. I looked 
  around me to see how cushioned I'd be if I were to get in an accident. I was 
  sitting sideways, next to another man who would cushion me in an accident. I 
  looked to see how everyone else was cushioned. There was only one person 
  better-cushioned than I. I thought about having an accident for about five to 
  ten minutes. Then I relaxed a final time, and I stayed relaxed for the rest of 
  the bus ride. Sure enough, my bus then hit a van from behind. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Deja Vu</H3>
<P>Deja Vu is similar to precognition; you have a certain sense of knowing what 
the future will be, but there is also an overwhelming sense of having done it 
all before. It is as if the whole scene was rehearsed countless times in the 
past. It is typical to ask yourself, "Haven't I done this before?" These 
experiences tie into psychic dreams. Here is an example from my journals: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>07/05/84 Thu 
  <P>I've had two deja vu experiences recently. The first I'll mention was 
  today. I was at APS, at CC's terminal. CC was on the phone, and I knew every 
  word she said, before she said it. I broke out laughing, but she didn't 
  understand why I was laughing. 
  <P>The other experience was last Tuesday. I was at APS, talking to SB about 
  [the] BASIC [computer language] when I remembered I had done this once before 
  in a dream, and I knew everything SB was going to say. In the dream, my boss 
  DJ walked in and saw me talking with SB about BASIC. I was embarrassed because 
  I don't normally use BASIC in my work. I thought, "Oh no! DJ will be coming in 
  here any instant and I'll have to explain myself. I've got to get out of here 
  fast!" So I tried to excuse myself and leave. But when I tried to leave, SB 
  asked me some question, which delayed me further. I answered and tried to 
  leave again. He stopped me again saying "Hang on, let me show you something." 
  I tried to escape a third time and fourth time, but each time SB came up with 
  a reason to keep me there. Then DJ came in the room and said the same thing he 
  said in my dream. I was indeed embarrassed, and I had to explain my interest 
  in BASIC, and how it pertains to my current work. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The example mentioned above lasted a long time--about twenty minutes. Both 
experiences were "remembered" from a dream. At times I would dream the future 
quite often, and the dreams would give me a deja vu experience later. My 
personal belief is that we use our dreams sometimes to plan the future. The 
dreams were the plans, and the plans were carried out perfectly. In these cases 
my efforts to change the planned events were continually thwarted. 
<H3>Apparitions</H3>
<P>The main problem I had with most psychic experiences is that they were not 
very concrete. Often they were just "feelings" I had about situations, or a 
"stray" thoughts in my mind. I had a hard time believing in these phenomena. I 
found out there were other, more concrete types of psychic phenomena, such as 
apparitions. An apparition is the physical appearance of a nonphysical entity or 
object. The following is an example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>08/19/83 Fri 
  <P>Wednesday I had read an article in The Encyclopedia of Occultism and 
  Parapsychology, on the subject of mediumship. The articles talked about 
  physical manifestations of all sorts, and I was interested in it. I wished 
  right then that some spirits would do a physical manifestation for me, to 
  prove it to me. 
  <P>Later that night I woke up startled, with a sense of danger. I opened my 
  eyes and much to my shock I saw a hand materialized in midair near my head, 
  and the hand held something. I was so shocked and frightened that I jumped and 
  shook the bed violently. Whatever was in the hand went flying, and the hand 
  withdrew from me and went up and disintegrated. I fainted and my consciousness 
  gradually fell into nothingness, although there was a slight delay. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Psychokinesis (PK) or Telekinesis (TK)</H3>
<P>Psychokinesis is when something is physically moved or altered by psychic 
means. One day I had just left my place of work at about 8:00pm. I was very 
excited about many things: The book I was reading was exciting, I recently had 
an exciting OBE and other exciting things were happening. For some reason, as I 
waited to catch my bus, I felt very psychically strong. I felt as if I could do 
anything. I'm never idle with such feelings; I had to find some way to test out 
this feeling of power. I looked around for nearby objects. "If I really have 
this power," I reasoned to myself, "I can probably walk over to any parking 
meter and open it up with my mind." I walked over to a random parking meter, 
slipped my hands gently around it, and it opened effortlessly! Shiny coins 
spilled all over the ground. For a second or two I stood there in shock. What if 
someone saw me? What should I do? I am a very honest person. I tried to close 
the meter, but spilled coins were keeping the door from closing. I quickly 
cleared it out, closed the door, and started frantically plugging coins into the 
meter. Occasional drivers must have thought I was crazy plugging handfuls of 
coins into a parking meter, long after parking hours. Especially since there 
wasn't a car in that spot! I picked up all the coins from the ground and plugged 
them one by one into the meter. My heart was still pounding as I got on the bus, 
and a long time after that. 
<P>Here is another example from my journals: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>09/24/84 Mon 
  <P>Weird things are starting to happen again. After work I wanted to do some 
  drawing, but I haven't seen my drawing pencil since our trip. I tried 
  unsuccessfully to find the pencil many times since. The last time I looked was 
  Saturday when I searched the house and JP's apartment. 
  <P>Today I searched again for it, but without success and while I was 
  searching, my inner voice said, "try using your psi to find it." I didn't find 
  it, so JP and I decided to go shopping for one. Before we left I sat in the 
  middle of his living room next to the biggest chair, waiting for him to get 
  ready. 
  <P>We went shopping but I didn't buy a new pencil since JP offered to lend me 
  one. When we got home, I went up to JP's apartment. While he got on the phone, 
  I wandered into the middle of his living room. There, in the middle of JP's 
  biggest chair was my drawing pencil! I asked JP about it, but he said it was 
  impossible because he had been sitting on that chair just before we left! 
  Therefore, before we left there was no pencil on the chair, or in fact 
  anywhere to be found. But when we returned, the pencil was lying on the chair. 
  There is absolutely no possible explanation of how that pencil appeared there, 
  where it came from, or anything. It had to have been teleported there because 
  JP was never out of my sight from the time we left until the time we returned. 
  That chair was empty when we left. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Clairaudience</H3>
<P>Clairaudience is the ability to hear voices of people who are not physically 
present. Experience would suggest this can happen between two living persons as 
well as the traditional "spirit voices." This is different from telepathy. In 
telepathy you "pick up" the thoughts of others. In clairaudience, you hear a 
voice as plain as day. When it's happened to me, it's been so loud and clear 
that I've looked around to see who was speaking, but no one was in sight. Here 
are two good examples: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>10/14/83 Fri 
  <P>One other remarkable thing happened a couple of weeks ago. I was at the 
  University campus, walking to one of my classes, and I was thinking about an 
  article in The Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology that said the term 
  "inner voice" refers to clairaudience. Suddenly I spiritually heard a female 
  voice. The voice said "My name is Julia, and I say it's not important where 
  the wisdom comes from, but rather, it's the wisdom itself that counts!" That 
  was the first time I ever heard a voice that claimed to have a name! Also, 
  that voice didn't need translation like my inner voice does. Instead, the 
  words came through directly. Naturally, it shocked me quite a lot. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>07/05/84 Thu 
  <P>Today I was working at a customer site for work. I had arranged for SO to 
  meet me at P Company at 6:00pm. At 5:40pm I looked at my watch and thought, "I 
  have plenty of time; SO won't be here for twenty minutes." So I started 
  entering data into their computer. At 5:45pm I heard SO's voice--loud and 
  clear--yelling something like, "Hello? Anyone there?" I couldn't believe SO 
  would be there so early, yet I heard his voice. It sounded as if he were 
  yelling from outside yet I was sitting in the Parts Room in the middle of a 
  big building. All the windows were closed and locked about 100 feet away. 
  <P>I ran to the big doors, opened them, and ran outside, only to find SO just 
  getting off his motorcycle, taking off his (full) helmet. I asked him if he 
  yelled anything and he said he didn't; he just arrived. He said he tried to 
  mentally send the message to me! I checked; there was no way he could have 
  yelled loud enough for me to hear him in the Parts Room (especially with his 
  motorcycle helmet on!) The alarming thing about this was the clarity of his 
  "voice." It sounded as plain as day. I should also mention that I had a radio 
  playing at the time, and I "heard" his voice over the sound of the radio. It 
  was that clear. SO remarked, "either you're very sensitive or I'm a very 
  strong transmitter." </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Other Experiences</H3>
<P>Some experiences just don't quite fit into any categories. Here are a few 
examples: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>09/27/80 Sat 
  <P>A large moth came into my bedroom. I mentally commanded it to enter my 
  cupped hands. It immediately fluttered directly into my hands, and I cupped my 
  hands around it. Then I promptly ushered it out of the house without harming 
  it. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>04/17/81 Fri 
  <P>For some reason or another I was trying to think of the German word for 
  "tired." I wracked my brains. I was still trying to remember it when I heard 
  myself physically say, "Mude!" Then I thought, "Yeah, that's it." Then I 
  realized what happened. I remembered the word only because my body just said 
  it. I had no intention of saying anything, nor did I remember the word until 
  after I said it. Weird! </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Conclusions:</H3>
<P>Of course, there are also many psychic things I haven't experienced. I've 
never experienced mediumship, automatic writing, or anything like that. 
<P>When most of these experiences were happening to me, I wasn't really 
expecting them or even wanting them. I wanted OBEs because they were concrete 
and indisputable in my own mind. They couldn't be brushed off as coincidences or 
delusions of grandeur. It was undeniably real to me as a participant. Still, 
when I practiced my OBE techniques, I was exploring altered states of 
consciousness and meditation. And that was enough to unlock all these other 
"psychic" experiences, and more. 
<P>Therefore, I warn you: if you do plan to try out-of-body experiences for 
yourself, be prepared for a possible barrage of other psychic experiences. On 
the other hand, if your aim is to develop psychic abilities, practicing OBE 
techniques may work well. You may get a few OBEs out of the deal too! 
<P>The possibilities of psychic experience are as wide and varied as normal 
experience. But a person's psychic abilities don't make them more spiritual or 
better than anyone else. Rather than to aim for inducing out-of-body experiences 
or psychic experiences, I would prefer that you strive for spiritual growth 
(whatever that means to you.) I believe that working on your own spiritual 
growth will naturally make you more psychic as you progress. 
<P>

<H2>EXERCISE 25</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Developing Psychic Skills</H3></CENTER>
<P>As I learned more about psychic experiences, I discovered that my psychic 
abilities fade in and fade out in cycles. At times they are strong, and at other 
times they seemed to fade out completely. I also learned that it's possible to 
increase psychic abilities. Here are some exercises that may increase your 
psychic abilities: 
<UL>
  <LI>Practice meditation and OBEs. 
  <LI>Give yourself suggestions just before sleep and when you first wake up. 
  For example: "I want to be psychic." 
  <LI>Visualize yourself pouring love out in all directions. 
  <LI>Imagine extending your awareness until you're trying to feel the emotions 
  of your whole neighborhood. 
  <LI>Try musical meditation and listening to hypnotic songs. 
  <LI>Give yourself reminders ("post-it" notes or whatever) with messages like 
  "You are psychic" or "You can leave your body." 
  <LI>Make pacts with your Higher Self. Here is an example: </LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>I want to be psychic. I know that the Universe will respond to my needs and 
  desires quickly and completely. In return, I promise to cooperate with my 
  oversoul, follow impulses, act on intuitions, share knowledge, spread love and 
  cooperate with my Higher Self. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
