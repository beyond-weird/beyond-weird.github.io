<H1>CHAPTER 21 </H1></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H2>People and Animals</H2></CENTER>
<P>People often ask me, do you ever meet anyone while you're out of your body? 
Yes, I have, but not often. Maybe 10 percent of my OBEs have had interaction 
with other people. There are two categories of people you are likely to meet 
during an OBE: physical and nonphysical. A physical person is inside their 
physical body during your OBE. A nonphysical person can be someone who is also 
having an OBE, or a person who is without a physical body--"dead." 
<P>When you meet someone on the astral plane, it's easy to tell if they are 
physical or nonphysical. The physical people usually seem preoccupied with 
trivialities. If you meet up with a physical person, they will usually be busily 
preoccupied with reading, doing dishes or another physical activity. They don't 
seem to notice you. You can speak with them, but usually they won't look at you 
while they speak, although sometimes it may seem as if they look at you. 
Physical people are always affected by gravity. Also, physical people usually 
have irregular or discolored auras. 
<P>On the other hand, nonphysical people are not preoccupied. They usually 
notice you, and look at you when they are talking. They often wear out-of-place 
clothes. And they can be found perched in midair or just about anywhere. Quite 
often in my experience, I've been able to hear or "feel" the presence of 
discarnates, but haven't been able to see them. Also, their auras are mostly 
clear, regularly shaped and evenly colored. 
<P>There may also be cases where nonphysical people don't seem to see you. A 
good example of this is OBE #116, mentioned in chapter 16, where I saw a group 
of people in my room, dressed in 1950's style clothes. In these cases, I'm not 
sure if I am seeing spirits from a different "wavelength" or some sort of 
psychic afterimage. 
<H3>Physical People</H3>
<P>In Robert Monroe's first book, he believed that when we are speaking to a 
physical person, we are talking with their subconscious minds. He described 
elaborate conversations with people while out of the body, but when he went to 
verify the experience, nobody remembered the conversations. His theory seems to 
fit perfectly with my experiences. Talking to a physical person is strained, as 
if they are too preoccupied to talk with you. Or perhaps their conscious minds 
feel uneasy having their subconscious talking with a "spirit." It seems as if 
physical people are so focused on their daily lives that they feel uncomfortable 
turning any portion of their consciousness away from that focus. For example, 
during OBE #21 mentioned in chapter 18, when I tried to rouse my mom from sleep, 
she just seemed to ignore me. Here are a few more examples from my journals: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>05/02/81 Sat - OBE #39 
  <P>...I walked through the living room of JP's apartment and entered JP and 
  CA's bedroom. Both JP and CA were in bed. CA was laying down with her eyes 
  closed. JP was sitting up in bed with some reading material. I jumped up and 
  down and waved my hands to try to get JP's attention. He looked up at me. Then 
  he nudged CA and she stirred. He pointed at me and said, "Look. I think 
  there's something there." She looked, but didn't say anything. I didn't want 
  them to be afraid of me, so I said, "It's me, Bob. I'm projecting." JP then 
  said, "It's probably Bob projecting," as though he didn't hear me. He went 
  back to reading. I said, "How can I be sure I'm going to remember this? What 
  if I forget? I've got to remember." JP said, "Don't worry, we'll remember for 
  you." I said, "How can I be sure you will remember?" He said, "We're awake. We 
  should remember." I said, "Okay, but I may still forget." He said, "Don't 
  worry about it; you'll remember." </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>When I asked JP and CA about this incident later that day, they didn't 
remember anything. JP was reading at the time. CA was awake but doing various 
things around the apartment. Several times, she reclined on the bed to relax for 
a few minutes. Here's another example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>07/30/81 Thu - OBE #44 
  <P>...Well, I turned around and saw my father sitting in a kitchen chair with 
  a sad expression on his face. I didn't want to speak, but I tried to get his 
  attention by waving my hands in the place he seemed to be staring. I was about 
  six or seven feet away from him. He finally looked up and said something like, 
  "Oh. Hello." I said, "Hi! Look! I'm projecting!" With that, I decided to 
  continue on, not wanting to waste any projecting time; and Dad didn't seem 
  interested. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Non-Physical People</H3>
<P>The experience quoted above happened when my father was alive. The following 
experience happened after his death: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>12/20/81 Sun - OBE #60 
  <P>...I twisted and reached for the window. I tried to pull myself toward it 
  with my mind. My consciousness was dimmed again but this time I thought I saw 
  a small boy of 12 or so [years old] watching me from the northeast upper 
  corner of my bedroom (by my window). I felt two or three older people that 
  were on the other side of my bedroom wall. The boy said something to me and 
  then he talked with the older people for a while. I don't remember what was 
  said. The boy had dark brown hair, sparkling eyes, and a grin that seemed to 
  indicate that he was pleased and adventurous because I was out of my 
  body....The older people were standing up. One was male, one female, and I 
  didn't see the third well. These older people were about 35 to 40 years old 
  [in appearance] and were more serious [than the boy]. I only became aware of 
  these older people when they spoke to the boy and he answered. Just as I lost 
  consciousness I saw the boy slide down [what appeared to be] a ladder. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In this OBE, there seemed to be several people watching me, and speculating 
about me. They seemed to know me, as if they were my spirit guides, but I didn't 
consciously know any of them. The grinning boy seemed as if he were pleased with 
me. He acted lively and mischievous, with his big grin and sparkling eyes. 
However, none of them seemed to want to communicate with me. It was like they 
were scientists during an experiment, and I was the subject. 
<H3>Animals</H3>
<P>Some animals have more powerful senses than people. Dogs and cats can often 
see flying insects that our eyes miss unless we look closely. Animals also seem 
to be naturally psychic. I've talked to many people who have said their pets 
exhibited unusual behavior, such as staring off into space or circling their 
heads as if they were seeing spirits. Those people have looked for insects and 
other possible "normal" explanations for such behavior, without success. My 
family never had a pet by the time I was experiencing OBEs, but JP had a cat 
named Zack. During one OBE, I encountered Zack in JP's apartment. It was my only 
encounter with an animal, during an out-of-body experience: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>10/21/83 Fri - OBE #98 
  <P>This happened on 10/18/83: I've only had a chance to write it down now. I 
  was having strange dreams, and I became semiconscious. Then I noticed I was 
  weightless and that realization brought me to a fuller consciousness: I woke 
  up. I was in JP's living room and I saw JP's cat Zack, and he seemed to see 
  me. I decided as long as I was a spirit, and I was near Zack, I should try to 
  frighten him to prove to myself that he saw me. So I stood up tall, raised my 
  arms, and started to run, reaching toward Zack. That cat ran very quickly 
  away! </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>EXERCISE 21</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>A Ship's Bow</H3></CENTER>
<P>This is similar to the theater chair method. Relax completely. As vividly as 
you can, imagine you are standing on the bow (front) of a ship in the middle of 
the ocean. Imagine the water is completely calm and you are looking out over the 
water. You are completely at peace. Slowly, waves start to kick up and the boat 
starts to rock up and down. As the boat rocks up, feel yourself lift up. As the 
boat rocks down, feel yourself gently set down again. Gradually, make each wave 
bigger until the waves are ten feet high. With each wave, you rise and fall 
rhythmically. As you fall with each new wave, try to "feel" that sinking feeling 
in the pit of your stomach, as if you are really there. 
<P>Again, this can call the vibrations and pull you away from your body.
