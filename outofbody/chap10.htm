<H2>The Small Still Voice Within</H2></CENTER>
<P>One cold day in early 1980, I was waiting at a bus stop. At that time, I had 
about a dozen OBEs to my credit. I thought about my favorite television show, 
"Kung Fu," which always had tidbits of wisdom sprinkled throughout the show. The 
Shaolin masters in the show were always portrayed as kind and humble, but above 
all wise. I wished I could be wise like that. Then I remembered a story in the 
Bible about Solomon (1 Kings, 3: 5-13). In the story, God offered to give 
Solomon anything and Solomon chose the gift of wisdom. Solomon was rewarded well 
for his choice. I wondered what it would be like if I were wise: "If I were 
wise," I thought to myself, "I could probably think up any question and look 
inside and find a truly wise answer there." 
<P>If I were a wise man and someone asked me questions, what would I say? I 
started to fantasize, asking myself philosophical questions and making up 
answers, pretending I was wise. Suppose they asked, "What is love?" I paused to 
think. I'd say, "Love is the binding force of the Universe." If they asked "Who 
am I?" I would answer, "You are a spark of God's divine Light." 
<P>My bus wasn't there, so I continued with this daydream. I asked myself more 
questions. Each time I'd look deeper into myself for the answer. After a few 
times I was surprised at the answers I came up with; the answers didn't seem 
like me at all! At the time, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, so I didn't 
even write about it in my journal. 
<P>This "wisdom" game was a lot of fun, so the next few days I practiced 
whenever I had free time. Instead of asking specific questions, I started asking 
myself to "Say something wise." This also gave me unexpected results, such as: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Perfect love is never selfish. It's wrong not to love at all. It is better 
  to love someone and selfishly desire their love. It is still better to love 
  someone, and desire to give them your love, asking nothing in return. It is 
  best to love All That Is unselfishly, and recognize everything as a part of 
  that creation, including your loved one and yourself. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Upon closer examination, I didn't exactly make up "words" in my head when I 
asked myself questions. I got a jumble of thoughts, feelings, words, sounds and 
images, and I "translated" this jumble into words. Then I said the translated 
words to myself, and somehow they made sense. Later, this translation process 
became so automatic that it was just like "talking." 
<P>I had learned to ask myself questions, and come up with answers, but I was 
very skeptical about it. It seemed as if I were pretty much "making up" the 
answers I wanted, even if the answers often had a lot more "insight" than I 
thought I had. The answers just came to me from the top of my head. They only 
came when I asked, and often they were the first things that entered my mind 
after I formulated the question. For that reason, I viewed this all as a "game" 
I was playing, never taking it seriously. 
<P>Then the inner source of wisdom started to develop a personality of its own. 
Very gradually I started noticing that I was sometimes getting "answers" without 
asking questions. I started getting advice and reminders from within, which 
would come out of the blue. 
<P>I noticed that the answers addressed me in the second person; instead of 
receiving the message, "I should park over there" I would receive the message, 
"You should park over there, Bob." Also, the answers started getting more 
specific. Messages like, "You should park over there" became "You should park 
over there, because there's more time on that parking meter than this one." 
Later, these things turned out to be true. At first I thought I might be going 
crazy. Crazy people heard voices. But as I said before, I wasn't really hearing 
voices; I was just getting impressions and translating them into words. Then I 
began to worry about spirits. 
<P>So one day I decided to probe a little deeper into this issue. One day after 
I left work, I went for a short walk and started asking this "source" some new 
questions: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Q: "What is your name?" 
  <P>A: "You can call me anything you like." 
  <P>Q: "Do you have a name?" 
  <P>A: "Names are not important; wisdom is important. Remember, the message is 
  important, not the source." 
  <P>Q: "Are you a spirit?" 
  <P>A: "No, not as you think of it." 
  <P>Q: "Then what are you?" 
  <P>A: "Someone who has your best interests at heart: I am you; another part of 
  you." 
  <P>Q: "Why are you here? Why am I hearing you?" 
  <P>A: "My job is to help you in any way that I can, to help you become more 
  aware, to see that you pay attention to the lessons that you are learning." 
  <P>Q: "If you're me, than why do you address me as 'you'?" 
  <P>A: "That's to help you tell the difference between your own thoughts and my 
  messages." </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Because of some book I had read, I started calling it my "inner voice." For 
months I distrusted my inner voice. Sometimes I would take its advice and 
sometimes I would not. Time after time, my inner voice proved its guidance was 
sound, but still I would not trust it. And because I was afraid of what people 
would think, I never told anyone. 
<P>One day my inner voice started speaking with me, saying, "Why do you 
constantly fight me?" I replied, "I just don't trust you; I've heard of stories 
where insane people murder and later say that 'God' or 'Voices' told them to 
kill. If you ask me, any kind of nonverbal communication seems really strange to 
me; if anyone knew I talked to a voice inside of me, they would lock me up." My 
inner voice replied, "Have I ever told you to kill people? No! Have I ever told 
you a lie? No! Have I ever given you any reason to mistrust me? No! Has anything 
I've said ever been wrong? No!" 
<P>It continued. "Always remember this: It is okay to listen to your inner 
voice, and it is okay to take its advice, but always, always use your own 
judgment. You are not allowed to use me as an excuse for not taking action, or 
for taking an action, or for not using your own judgment. As long as you use 
your own common sense and judgment, you aren't going to murder people, because 
common sense tells you that murder is wrong." 
<P>"I am here to give you advice and helpful hints. I can give you answers to 
any questions, provided those questions are not part of your current lessons. 
For some lessons, you must find the answers for yourself." 
<P>"What I am asking is very simple. Try an experiment: try trusting me and 
taking my advice (while still using your own judgment and common sense) for one 
week, without fighting me. After one week, if I've lied to you or misguided you, 
feel free to ignore me. However, if my advice has been good, you can take this 
as far as you want." 
<P>I agreed to the experiment, and I started following the advice of my inner 
voice. One week passed and my psychic awareness increased. I decided I would 
continue to trust my inner voice until it gave me reasons to distrust it. 
<P>That was the beginning of a new cooperation between me and my inner voice: It 
started giving me more advice, helping me interpret my dreams and reminding me 
of things I had forgotten. For example, one morning I had gotten my motorcycle 
out of the garage to go to work when my inner voice said to bring my bag of 
tools with me--"It'll come in handy today; You'll regret it if you don't." So I 
got off my motorcycle, walked back inside and got my tool bag. I asked my inner 
voice if my motorcycle was going to run into mechanical problems. It replied, 
"Your motorcycle is fine." "Then why should I bring tools?" "Trust me. You'll 
regret it if you don't." Later that day, as I pulled into a parking spot, I 
noticed a man with a stalled truck. I asked, "Having truck problems?" He said, 
"Yeah. You haven't got a Phillips screwdriver on you, do you?" I got out the 
tool bag and gave him a screwdriver. I was glad I had brought the tools, and I 
thanked my inner voice. It was right--I would have regretted it if I had not 
brought the tools. 
<P>My inner voice is often fond of helping people. For example, one day I went 
to my credit union, but I arrived ten minutes before they opened. I walked down 
the street, wondering what I should do to kill the time. Then my inner voice 
asked me to go into MacDonalds, which was in the opposite direction. So I walked 
to MacDonalds and went inside. The man in front of me ordered some coffee, but 
his speech was very slurred because he was deaf. The man repeated himself 
several times, but the cashier didn't understand. I knew a bit of American Sign 
Language, so I acted as translator to allow him to speak with his cashier. After 
I left the restaurant, I felt good inside. My inner voice congratulated me for a 
job well done. 
<P>My inner voice also provided me with "psychic" information I could not have 
known otherwise. One day I decided to eat lunch in the cafeteria. I stood in 
line trying to decide what flavor of yogurt to buy. Finally I decided to get 
blueberry yogurt, so I picked up a container. Then my inner voice said, 
"Boysenberry." I asked my inner voice, "Do you mean I should switch?" It replied 
"That's okay. Eat what you like." So I decided to keep my blueberry yogurt. I 
sat down and opened it, and there was boysenberry flavored yogurt inside! The 
carton was plainly marked "Blueberry" and the carton was deep blue. But the 
yogurt inside was purple boysenberry. 
<P>My inner voice carefully guided my actions, and it always worked out to my 
advantage. This journal entry from 1985 shows what I mean: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>02-09-85 Sat 
  <P>More "Psychic" events. About a month ago I found out that Boston (the rock 
  group) had a member named Barry Goudreau, who put out an album. Since I'm a 
  fan of Boston I tried to find the album, but it was out of print. I went to 
  every record store I knew in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area, but nobody had 
  it. I told JO that I'd mail her a copy of the album on cassette tape if I ever 
  found it. Well, I was going to mail another tape to JO today, and my inner 
  voice was very active. 
  <P>First I had to go to an office-supply store to find a mailer to mail the 
  tape in. I went and found a perfect-sized mailer, and was going to buy one, 
  when my inner voice said, "Get two!" I asked it, "Why? I'm not planning to 
  send any more tapes for a while." My inner voice just said, "Just get two; I'm 
  sure you can find a use for the second one." I was in a hurry, so I didn't 
  argue with my inner voice, I just bought two, without any plans to send 
  another tape. When I went to the post office, I got the best parking spot, 
  when all of the other available parking was taken. My inner voice suggested 
  before I left from home that I should make some copies of the latest MSPR 
  [Minnesota Society for Parapsychological Research] newsletter. So after I left 
  the post office, I went to the University to make more copies of the 
  newsletter. As fate would have it, I couldn't find a parking spot except two 
  blocks away from the print shop. My inner voice said, "Park here; it's not 
  that far to walk." So I parked there, and started walking to the print shop. 
  On the way, I noticed something interesting in a shop window, so I looked at 
  the shop. It was a record shop, a very tiny one I didn't know about and one 
  I'd never been in. My inner voice said, "Go in. The newsletters will wait." So 
  I went in. It was a very small record shop, but there was a section that said 
  "ON SALE." My inner voice said, "Go over there and look in the "G's." I 
  replied mentally, "Oh come on! I hunted in every record store in Minnesota for 
  Barry Goudreau's album; this tiny store won't have it, and they wouldn't have 
  it on sale!" But I thought, "Oh what the heck, it doesn't hurt to look." Sure 
  enough, I had been very carefully guided to find Barry Goudreau's album, and 
  it only cost me $2.19! I told the shop owner that I'd been hunting high and 
  low for that album, and had been to almost every record store in the Twin 
  Cities, and couldn't find it anywhere. He said, "Really? That's interesting. 
  And now you found it on sale." 
  <P>Then I made the copies of the newsletter. I came out of the print shop and 
  I remembered that I never fed my parking meter. My inner voice said, "Don't 
  worry about it. Go over to JRCA and buy some tapes to record the album." I 
  argued back, "But my parking meter is expired, and JRCA's tapes are not as 
  cheap as Best Buy. I could go to my car, save myself a ticket and get tapes at 
  Best Buy for $2.00 each, whereas JRCA tapes are usually $2.50 each." But my 
  inner voice insisted that I go to JRCA. Despite always arguing with my inner 
  voice, it always knows what is best for me. I went to JRCA, and asked "How 
  much are your Maxell UDXL-II's?" The man went and grabbed four tapes (I wanted 
  to buy four tapes, but I didn't tell him that!) He told me the tapes were 
  $1.99 each! I only had $9.00 left, so I had just enough money to buy four 
  tapes! I got back to my car. No ticket! </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>My inner voice has been responsible for much of the "psychic" information I 
have received. In many ways, it seems like "cheating" because I don't have to 
work for this information; it's there for the asking. 
<P>I also found out my inner voice had a sense of humor. One morning I wrote 
down an out-of-body experience and I lost track of the time. When I realized I 
was running behind, I left in a hurry. I bolted out the door when my inner voice 
suddenly interrupted, "Hey, Bob, you forgot to lock the door!" I ran back, 
locked the door and thanked my inner voice. My inner voice jokingly replied, 
"You'd forget your body if it wasn't attached!" 
<P>I've also been helped by my inner voice during my out-of-body experiences. 
For example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>07/25/82 Sun - OBE #80 
  <P>...I used the same swaying method to get out of my body again....I was 
  stuck to my body. I thought about it some more. I figured that the only way I 
  could move was to close my eyes and trust my feelings. So I closed my eyes but 
  immediately thought, "No! If I close my eyes, I might fall asleep!" If I have 
  been reading for an hour, and I close my eyes, I will usually fall asleep. I 
  can tell how likely this is to happen to me. So although I had started to 
  move, I decided to open my eyes, and I saw that I was again in the same place. 
  I thought of another way: if I could change my vision to purely astral vision 
  I should be okay, I thought. So I lifted my arms out in front of me, and I 
  tried to see clairvoyantly. I heard my inner voice clearly say, "Practicing 
  clairvoyant vision here will greatly help your Earthly clairvoyant vision." I 
  looked at my arms, not astrally, but clairvoyantly, as if trying to see a 
  spirit from the physical world. My arms were transparent when I looked at them 
  that way. They looked like transparent, dark black, filmy shadows. I studied 
  them for a while, then blacked out. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>Here is another example of 
my inner voice helping me during an OBE: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>10-31-82 Sun - OBE #83 
  <P>...Another thing happened last night. It was like a lesson from my inner 
  voice. It wanted to teach me the difference between clairvoyant vision and 
  out-of-body vision. So first it showed me a place clairvoyantly, and it said, 
  "this is clairvoyant vision." Then it showed me the same scene with 
  out-of-body vision. I remember some of the differences. First, although both 
  pictures were clear and vivid, the out-of-body picture had more of a sense of 
  depth. I could tell my spatial location, because I had normal depth 
  perception. In the clairvoyant vision, I saw the same things, and I could tell 
  it was three-dimensional, but it was more like a photograph, where some 
  particulars stood out more than others. In short, the clairvoyance was like 
  looking at a regular photograph, only some objects in the room seemed somehow 
  emphasized. The out-of-body vision was different in that I was in the picture. 
  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>My inner voice has been one of the most beneficial forces in my life. Amazing 
things can happen if you begin using this tool. Your inner voice has always been 
there; all you have to do is listen inside. 
<P>What exactly is an inner voice? Some people may believe it to be a spirit 
guide. Perhaps some of today's "trance channels" are merely talking to their 
inner voice, then doing the same sort of verbal translation. Personally, I 
believe the inner voice is a communications link to your oversoul, or higher 
self. 
<P>My inner voice is notoriously honest and blunt. Once I asked my inner voice, 
"Why didn't you communicate with me before that cold winter day?" It replied, 
"Why didn't you listen to me before?" I asked, "Why don't you talk to me more 
often now?" It replied, "Why don't you listen to me more often now?" Then it 
struck me: Why don't we all?

<H2>EXERCISE 10</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Astral Doorway</H3></CENTER>
<P>This is a variation of the OBE technique found in many books, such as Astral 
Doorways, by J.H.Brennan. 
<P>Get into a comfortable position and close your eyes. Relax as completely as 
you can, and start a visualization. Pretend that your consciousness shrinks into 
an infinitesimal pinpoint of light. Then visualize that you are standing in 
front of a locked door. Visualize the doorway any way you want, with fancy 
engravings and door knobs or whatever--personalize the doorway. 
<P>Next, visualize yourself taking a fancy key out of your pocket (or from a 
chain around your neck, etc.) and unlocking the door. Open the door and step 
through the doorway. Close the door behind you, and lock the door again. The 
symbolic act of locking the door is for protection: Lock it every time you use 
it. 
<P>Put the key back where you found it, and start walking forward. Imagine there 
is a tunnel in front of you with a bright light at the end. Imagine that you 
walk to the end of the tunnel, step outside and find yourself outside your body, 
standing next to it. 
<P>Next, visualize a complete out-of-body experience, in all the detail you can 
imagine. Imagine walking away from your body to a destination. Try to imagine 
and remember as much detail as possible. When you are done, imagine walking back 
to your body. Imagine finding yourself back in the tunnel, walking back to the 
door. Again, unlock the door, step through, and lock it again from the other 
side. Guide yourself back to full consciousness and open your eyes. 
<P>Many authors say that this exercise in visualization can induce genuine OBEs 
as well as impressing the idea on your subconscious.
