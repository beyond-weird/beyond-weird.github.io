<CENTER>
<H2>How to Have an Out-of-Body Experience</H2></CENTER>
<P>Many people try to induce OBEs without success because they don't know what 
to do. Unfortunately, most books on the subject don't contain instructions. The 
few books that contain instructions are typically vague and incomplete. In the 
exercises given with each chapter, I have already suggested many things to try. 
In this chapter, I want to fill in some of the gaps, and also provide a detailed 
description of my most successful method. Of course, I can't guarantee positive 
results. Your success depends on the amount of effort you put forth.</P><BR>
<H3>Conditioning</H3><BR>
<P>Most OBE authors agree that your subconscious takes you out of your body 
every night. With practice you can use this to your advantage: You can train 
your subconscious to "wake you up" after it has left the body. I have used many 
methods for impressing this idea on my subconscious: affirmations, reading 
books, listening to subliminal OBE suggestion tapes, playful visualizations and 
listening to music that has OBE-suggestive words. </P>
<P>The first method, affirmations or self-suggestion, is to tell yourself, "I 
want to have an out-of-body experience," "I want to leave my body" or similar 
suggestions. The best times to do this are right before you fall asleep and 
especially right after you wake up in the morning. At these times you are in 
close contact with your subconscious. I wake up very slowly. For about a half 
hour I'm in contact with my subconscious mind. When I give myself suggestions 
then, they are very effective. Make these affirmations several times a day. </P>
<P>The second method is to read OBE books. I usually have more OBEs when I've 
recently been reading a book on astral projection. Reading about OBEs and 
thinking about them as you read makes an impression on your subconscious mind 
that can often be more effective than self-suggestion. </P>
<P>The third method is to use suggestion tapes. The Monroe Institute now has 
sets of "Gateway" tapes to aid the would-be astral traveler. Valley of the Sun 
Publishing has a set called "Astral Projection" which contains one hypnosis tape 
and one subliminal suggestion tape. Other tapes are also available. </P>
<P>The fourth method is to use playful imagination. Affirmations that use 
visualization are even better than verbal affirmations. Visualize yourself 
separating from the body. As you do, think to yourself, "Yes, I can do that." 
Imagine elaborate scenes where you are either flying through valleys like a 
glider, or shooting away from your body into outer-space. Again, this should be 
done frequently throughout the day, and especially right after you wake up in 
the morning. </P>
<P>The fifth method is to listen to music with words that suggest OBEs. I made a 
tape for myself, full of such songs by various artists. The songs might not be 
about OBEs, but they still remind me of them enough to make an impression on my 
subconscious mind. Some examples are: "Kashmir" by Led Zeppelin, "Astral 
Traveler" by Yes, "The Wall" by Kansas, "Lights" by Styx, "Fly By Night" by Rush 
and "Backwards Traveler" by Paul McCartney. </P><BR>
<H3>Physical Preparation</H3><BR>
<P>The best time to attempt an OBE is in the morning, after you have woken up 
naturally (i.e., not from an alarm clock.) Since most of us work during the 
week, it's easier to try on the weekends. Give your body plenty of rest. Each 
person needs a different amount of sleep. The trick is to make your body tired 
enough to stay in a relaxed state, but not too tired. If I don't sleep enough, 
I'm too tired and fall back into a deep sleep while practicing. If I oversleep 
and then practice, I am too wide awake and can't focus well. The body should be 
well rested but relaxed, and the mind must be alert. </P>
<P>When the time comes to practice, try to detect how tired you are. If you're 
too tired, stretch a little in bed or shake the sleep off. Some people may want 
to get up first and have a cup of coffee first. This will usually keep you from 
falling back to sleep during practice. It is better to wake yourself up 
completely before starting. </P>
<P>Music is wonderful for relaxation and calming the mind. It's okay to listen 
to relaxing music during your OBE practice, but this can also work against you: 
Listening to external sounds can distract you from focusing inward. Also, if you 
listen to music before bedtime, you may be too relaxed and sleepy to practice 
the next morning. </P>
<P>When you practice, make sure you have good circulation. Get into a position 
where your limbs won't "fall asleep" because of poor circulation. </P>
<P>Make sure you won't be distracted during practice. Keep your windows closed 
to keep noises out, unplug the telephone, turn off all televisions, radios and 
other noisy things. Don't set any time limits on your practice. It is 
counter-productive to check the time and wonder if your time limit is up. Also, 
make sure your bladder is empty before practice; The need to go to the bathroom 
can ruin a good practice. </P><BR>
<H3>STEP 1. Relaxation</H3><BR>
<P>The next important condition for OBE induction is a completely relaxed 
physical body. Relaxation is important because if you aren't relaxed, you'll 
have too much consciousness focused in your body. Laboratory tests on astral 
travelers have shown (with the help of BSR and GSR skin resistance monitors) 
that the physical body is more relaxed during an OBE than during sleep. Ideally, 
your physical body should be completely relaxed in every respect during 
practice. I recommend practicing relaxation every day until you can completely 
relax your physical body in a few minutes. </P>
<P>Relax your body from limb to limb, working from your feet up to your head, 
until even your face is completely relaxed. Use any technique you are 
comfortable with to relax completely. If you don't know any relaxation 
techniques, do this: Systematically tighten each muscle and make it tense until 
there is a slight fatigue, then let go and feel the muscle relax. After you've 
relaxed every muscle, start over and check every muscle again. </P>
<P>You may notice that the more relaxed your body is, the less you can actually 
"feel" it. Encourage this feeling: While you're relaxing, pretend as vividly as 
you can that you do not have your left arm; as if it's been cut off and you 
can't feel it. When the sensation of having no arm becomes quite real to you, 
that arm is very relaxed. Next, pretend that your other arm does not exist. 
Next, your legs. Have some playful fun by pretending that your arms are in 
different positions, and see how vividly you can imagine these things. If you 
are able to lose all feeling in your arms and legs, or imaginarily feel they are 
in different positions, your body is very relaxed. </P>
<P>Next, relax your face completely. Here's one way to relax your face: With 
your eyes closed, stare deeper and deeper into the blackness, while very slowly 
tightening your eyebrows and rolling your eyes up slightly until your eyebrow 
muscles become tired. Then completely relax your facial muscles for about 15 
seconds. Repeat the process again until your eyebrow muscles are tired again, 
and relax again for another 15 seconds. Repeat this process about six or seven 
times. Completely relax your whole body again and then try to make your mind 
blank and relaxed too. The vibrations may even come at this point, making the 
rest of the process unnecessary! After you're completely relaxed, pay no more 
attention to your body. </P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>STEP 2. Quiesce and Focus Your Mind</H3><BR>
<P>This is the Single Most Important step. There are five key points to focusing 
your mind for OBE induction. They are: state of mind, realism, motion, 
receptivity and passivity. </P>
<P>When you are trying to leave your body the most important thing is your state 
of mind. When I've been in an "ideal" state of mind, leaving my body seems like 
child's play, as easy and natural as breathing. But when I'm not in that state 
of mind it seems very difficult. I can't "teach" this state of mind but I can 
describe what it's like. Once you've experienced astral projection you'll know 
what state of mind to aim for. The best state of mind is one in which you are a 
quiet, completely passive, single-minded observer. In this passive state, your 
mind does not wander. You are not emotional. You are not analytical either. You 
are merely an observer. Visualization is important in many OBE techniques and 
this passive state of mind makes it easier to visualize images a long time 
without your mind "wandering." </P>
<P>The second point, realism, has to do with the degree of focus. This world 
seems real to us because we are so focused here. You should learn to focus 
outside your body to such a degree that it all becomes real. Focus your mind 
into that single thread of consciousness. </P>
<P>The third point, motion, concerns the swaying motion you feel within your 
body. I start an inner "swaying" sensation in my imagination that later becomes 
quite real. Then I use the momentum of the swaying to propel myself out of my 
body. Pretend that your body is gently swaying back and forth, or left to right 
in a regular motion. Try to make this swaying feeling as vivid as possible. </P>
<P>The fourth point is receptivity. This receptive state of mind is important in 
calling or inducing the vibrations. You should learn to make yourself receptive 
to whatever comes during practice. </P>
<P>The fifth point, passivity, is also very important. The more passive you are, 
the easier it is to enter the OBE state. As long as you have a conscious 
"controlling interest" in your experience, you are too focused in this reality. 
Develop the attitude of doing the exercises, not because you are interested in 
watching them, but just for passive reasons: Just to see what happens next, or 
just for the sake of doing it. While practicing, you should only be concerned 
with the current moment in time. Be accepting of what comes. Try to assume an 
attitude where you really don't care what will happen. Be completely in the 
present moment, with no thoughts of what will happen next. The American Heritage 
Dictionary defines "<I>passive</I>" as: </P><BR>
<P>1. Receiving or subjected to an action without responding or initiating an 
action in return. 2. Accepting without objection or resistance; compliant. 3. 
Not participating, acting, or operating; inert.... </P><BR>
<P>By this definition, you should be in a state where you can be subjected to 
weird feelings without responding, physically or mentally. No matter what hits 
you, you should be in such a passive state that, when something hits you, you 
think, "Oh. That's nice," and just continue to lie there and visualize. </P>
<P>In this passive state, you can initiate actions (like the visualizations) 
without responding to them. You fall asleep by becoming interested in, and 
responding to your own thoughts and visualizations. If you can initiate that 
state and keep your consciousness out of that dream-trap, you can retain your 
consciousness after it leaves your body. You just want to become a passive 
observer. </P>
<P>I've talked before about needing to suspend a certain portion of your 
consciousness to leave your body. Suspend the portion that has a vested interest 
in what's happening. </P>
<P>Slow your thoughts and bring yourself into that passive and receptive state 
of mind. Clear your mind of all thoughts: There are many techniques for doing 
this. If you don't have a method, try the following: With your eyes closed, 
pretend that you're looking for something that might appear directly in front of 
you. Just quietly watch your mental viewing screen. Stare into the blackness. 
</P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>STEP 3. Wander the Edge of Consciousness</H3><BR>
<P>The next step is to "wander the edge of consciousness," exploring the border 
between waking and sleeping. Allow yourself to start falling asleep, but then 
"catch" yourself and rouse yourself again and make sure you're fully conscious. 
Let yourself start to fall asleep again, this time allowing yourself to get a 
little closer toward sleep, then rouse yourself again. Do this several times 
until your body is very relaxed and your mind is in that "passive" framework 
that I discussed. </P>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>Step 4. Visualize an object</H3><BR>
<P>Next, visualize a small object, such as a small cube, about six feet directly 
in front of your face. Visualize this as clearly as you can. Don't continue 
until you can see this object clearly in your mind's eye. </P>
<CENTER><IMG src="chap24_files/diag1.gif"> </CENTER>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>Step 5. Sway the Object a Small Amount</H3><BR>
<P>Then begin to move the object back and forth so that it appears to come a 
little bit closer to you and then moves back to where it began. At first, 
visualize only a tiny amount of movement, as if the object is merely slowly 
swaying toward you and away from you. </P>
<P>Keep the object swaying constantly. Don't let it stop moving. Keeping the 
object in motion will help to stabilize the image in your mind and give it more 
realism. </P><BR>
<CENTER><IMG src="chap24_files/diag2.gif"> </CENTER>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>Step 6. Increase the Amount of Swaying</H3><BR>
<P>Slowly increase the distance the object sways. Keep swinging the image back 
and forth toward you, each time bringing it a bit closer to you. As you do this, 
the image may seem to become more real. Make sure your visualization has a sense 
of perspective and depth. Each time the object comes closer, it should look 
bigger. Each time the object pulls away, it should look smaller. Remember, you 
must also keep that passive, quiesced state of mind during the entire exercise. 
</P><BR>
<CENTER><IMG src="chap24_files/diag3.gif"> </CENTER>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>Step 7. Sway Opposite To The Object</H3><BR>
<P>Try to feel as if you are swaying in the opposite direction as the object. 
Imagine the object has a strong gravity which affects your swaying. As the 
object swings closer to you, you are pulled toward it. As it swings away from 
you, you sway back to your original position within your body. </P>
<P>As the object gets closer and closer with each swing, feel its gravity pull 
you more and more in its direction. </P><BR>
<CENTER><IMG src="chap24_files/diag5.gif"> <IMG src="chap24_files/diag6.gif"> 
<IMG src="chap24_files/diag7.gif"> </CENTER>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>Step 8. Grab The Object And Let It Pull You Out</H3><BR>
<P>After the image becomes very vivid, when it swings close to you, "grab" onto 
the image with your mind. As the image swings away, your consciousness will 
follow it and will be consciously pulled away from your body. </P><BR>
<CENTER><IMG src="chap24_files/diag8.gif"> <IMG src="chap24_files/diag9.gif"> 
</CENTER><BR>
<P>At this point you will be out of your body. Then you can "let go" of that 
quiesced state of mind, expand your consciousness and you will be very wide 
awake and very alert. You are then free to explore the nonphysical world! </P>
<P>It is important to examine your consciousness during the experience to make 
sure that you are not dreaming. During the experience, ask yourself, "Is this 
really happening, or is it a dream?" After you return to your body recall how 
conscious you were during the experience.</P>
<P>Learning to leave your body is something that takes a lot of time, practice 
and patience. Don't expect results over night. This chapter has a lot of 
information to absorb at once. You may spend several attempts just trying to 
remember all the subtleties involved. Some people don't have any OBEs until they 
have spent years trying. And some people don't get results because they try too 
hard; learn to let go. The good news is, the first OBE is the hardest. Once 
you've had an OBE, it's easier to induce more. 
<P>Also, don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. Develop your own 
techniques. Use whatever works best for you.
