<H1>INTRODUCTION </H1></CENTER>
<P>This book is about Out-of-Body Experiences, or "OBEs" for short. The OBE is 
also called Astral Projection in much of the literature. I'll use these terms 
interchangeably in this book. Simply put, an OBE is an experience in which you 
seem to be consciously apart from your physical body. 
<P>This book is not a complete detailed discourse on the OBE; there are dozens 
of books on out-of-body experiences, with stories, theories, and good 
information. Rather, this book offers a new perspective on the OBE, based on the 
author's experience and point of view. My goal is not to reiterate the old 
theories, but to present new information based on what I've learned and provide 
tools to induce OBEs. 
<P>A good word to describe an OBE is "Escapade," which has the same root as the 
word "Escape." According to the American Heritage Dictionary, an escapade is: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>An adventurous action that usually violates conventional standards of 
  behavior. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It's an escape from our bodies. It is adventurous. And it certainly violates 
conventional standards of behavior! 
<P>Most OBEs have common features. For instance, the subjects often see their 
own physical body during the experience, like any other object in the room. They 
usually report having "ghostly" bodies that can pass through solid objects 
during the experience. Sometimes their ghostly bodies are even seen by others! 
They also report floating or flying, and often report seeing places or events 
that were out of eyesight. 
<P>There are many books about Out-of-Body Experiences with many different 
approaches, from scientific to the occult (see the bibliography for more 
information). Many of these books give the readers stern warnings against trying 
it themselves, for fear of: death, disease, possession, insanity, heart attack 
and even the fear of being mistaken for dead and buried alive! I'm writing this 
book to try to dispel some of these myths. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Is it Scary?</H3></CENTER>
<P>Of course it's scary. Anytime we face the unknown, it is frightening. But 
approaching anything with fear is harmful. Early European sailors believed the 
Earth was flat and they could sail off the edge. Because of their fear of the 
unknown, they concluded it was dangerous to sail too far west. When they 
conquered their fear and went bravely ahead, not only did they discover a whole 
new world, they also made the transition from two-dimensional thinking to 
three-dimensional thinking about their reality. Likewise, if we can conquer our 
fears, we will also discover a whole new world, and we will make the transition 
from three-dimensional thinking to four-or-more-dimensional thinking about our 
reality. 
<P>All the great pioneers have set aside their fears, at least temporarily, and 
gone ahead despite the dangers. Courage is not the ability to walk into danger 
without fear. Courage is the ability to walk into a dangerous or frightening 
situation and think to yourself, "Yes, I'm scared--I'm scared to death--but 
that's not going to stop me." The thing I liked most about the book, Dune by 
Frank Herbert, is the saying that "Fear is the mind-killer." 
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>"What if it's dangerous?"</H3></CENTER>
<P>Many things in life are dangerous. Driving a car is dangerous. Crossing the 
street is dangerous. We do those things anyway. Sometimes walking into a 
dangerous situation is our best course of action. In her book, Out-of-Body 
Experiences, Janet Mitchell presents the following analogy: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>My parents did not keep me from walking or tell me that I couldn't, even 
  though they knew I might accidentally walk in front of a moving vehicle; they 
  did teach me how to cross the street safely. (Pg. 84) </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>I'm not saying we should walk blindly into the street; I am saying that if we 
look both ways, we can safely "cross the street" of the out-of-body experience, 
and add a whole new dimension to our lives. In other words, "No guts, no glory." 

<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>"What good is it?"</H3></CENTER>
<P>We can gain immeasurably from the OBE. Almost every book I've read on OBEs 
says that OBEs have a profound impact on people. People come away with a new 
attitude toward life and death. 
<P>With OBEs we may learn about the conditions after death and what "The great 
beyond" is really like. We might use it as a spring board for developing psychic 
abilities. We might discover (for ourselves) the truths and myths behind the 
world's great religions. If science can reproduce OBEs in the lab, they may 
discover the scientific laws governing mind and matter that psychic abilities 
are only hinting at today. Some people have even suggested the possibility of 
using it for industrial espionage, covert intelligence and similar applications. 
Above all in importance, I believe astral projection can help us become more 
spiritual. 
<P>I personally believe that true "value" is not to be found in material things, 
but in spirituality. Whatever "spirituality" means to you is okay in your life, 
as long as you don't "go off the deep end" with it. Spirituality should not be 
used as a license to justify immorality, nor should it be forcefully pushed on 
other people. Spirituality is a personal thing, and it means something different 
to everyone. 
<P>The American Heritage Dictionary defines "Spiritual" as: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>1. Of, relating to, consisting of, or having the nature of spirit; not 
  tangible or material. 2. Of, concerned with, or affecting the soul. 3. Of, 
  from, or pertaining to God; deific. 4. Of or belonging to a church or 
  religion; sacred. 5. Pertaining to or having the nature of spirits; 
  supernatural. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What better way is there to learn about spiritual things than to experience 
directly, "the nature of spirit; not tangible or material?" If you leave your 
body, you are spirit. You are not tangible or material. You will be concerned 
with and affecting your soul. And you will have the nature of spirits. You'll 
actually fit three out of five definitions of "spiritual!" 
<P>Having OBEs does not automatically make you spiritual. However, all it took 
was one good look at my inanimate body for me to realize that we are spiritual 
beings, and the "next life" is not so far off! 
<P>This book has two parts. Part One is the story of how I changed from skeptic 
to believer, and what you can expect to experience if you attempt to have OBEs 
yourself. Part Two is informational, with information and techniques based on my 
out-of- body experiences. 
<P>In addition to a chapter on OBE techniques, each chapter will include simple 
exercises and pointers to help readers who want to achieve OBEs. You can choose 
to follow or ignore the exercises as you wish. I do, however, recommend that you 
at least read the exercises because they do provide useful information to 
supplement the main text. 
<P>One last note. Throughout the book, I include excerpts from my out-of-body 
journals that illustrate key points. Usually the text has been left unchanged 
from the original, but I have omitted sections that I felt were either 
irrelevant, or of a personal nature. I also corrected the grammar and spelling. 
At times I've added small clarifications to the text, which I enclose in square 
brackets [like this]. In all cases I've strived not to alter the meaning of the 
text. 
<P>Also, throughout the book I have exchanged people's names with their initials 
to protect their identities. 
<P>And now, dear readers, it's time to take the out-of-body experience out of 
the closet!
