<H2>Out-of-Body Reality</H2></CENTER>
<P>Many books about out-of-body experiences say that during an OBE, our thoughts 
produce instant reality. Well, maybe not instantly. Sometimes it seems as if our 
subconscious thoughts are more powerful than our conscious thoughts. Our 
beliefs, expectations and fears also play a large part in what we experience 
while out of our bodies. 
<P>For instance, why do you even have an astral body? While you are out of your 
body, why should you need a body at all? Why do you need astral hands? If you 
try to pick something up, your hands will pass right through the object. Why do 
you need astral eyes? With mind-sensing, you can sense everything around you 
without even using your eyes. Why do you need astral legs if you can just as 
easily float or fly wherever you want? The answer is, you don't need an astral 
body! We have astral bodies because we are so accustomed to operating with a 
body. It's part of our self-image. We believe in our bodies so strongly that we 
create astral bodies for ourselves to use during an OBE. Perhaps we also do it 
as a convenience to others. How would we recognize a friend if he or she didn't 
have an astral body with their familiar face? 
<P>Let's take this one step further. During an OBE, are we naked or do we wear 
clothes? The answer is, sometimes we are naked, but most of the time we do wear 
astral clothes. The few people who report being naked during an OBE usually 
"feel naked" without their body. 
<P>Others report that they were wearing white robes, unlike any clothes they own 
in physical life. These people usually believe that they are dead or they are 
temporarily spirits, and what else do spirits wear? 
<P>There are also many people who find themselves in astral clothes identical to 
the clothes they were wearing at the time of the OBE. Often these people don't 
realize at first that they are out of their bodies. One moment they lie down for 
a nap, and the next moment they find themselves standing up and feeling light on 
their feet. And of course, they believe they are wearing the same clothes. 
<P>More common, however, is the case where the subject doesn't remember whether 
he or she was wearing clothes. They just don't seem to notice. That is usually 
the case during my OBEs. I don't even think about the clothes I am wearing, and 
since I'm not thinking about it, no clothes are created. And I don't even notice 
the clothes are missing. 
<P>The point is, while we are out of the body our beliefs do influence our 
experience. Our thoughts also influence our experience, but they are subject to 
our beliefs. 
<P>Not only does this law work for astral objects like clothes, but our astral 
bodies as well. If we believe our astral bodies are malleable, they will be. 
Some people have reported their astral bodies were not in the shape of a human 
body, but in another shape. Take the following OBE for example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>11/08/81 Sun - OBE #55 
  <P>...I separated my head last, and then I felt just like a balloon. I was 
  bouncing up and down but stuck to my body in a way I could not tell. I 
  couldn't turn around. My consciousness was again very clear and concise....If 
  I had an astral body, then it was curled up into a ball-shape. And I was stuck 
  to my body's right side; that is, by the right arm. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>After experiencing a few OBEs and reading several books, I came to believe 
the astral body was not solid. As a result, I started having experiences like 
the following: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>02/23/80 - OBE #9 
  <P>...Another strange thing about this morning's projection is: I folded my 
  arms around my chest to rest them, but they went right through my chest! They 
  rested on the bed. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This example shows the malleability of the astral body: I folded my arms 
through my chest instead of on top. 
<P>Some people can travel just by thinking of a person or place. But it's not 
always that simple. It's not just the thought that makes us travel, but our 
beliefs too. In Journeys Out of the Body, Robert Monroe wasn't always able to 
travel to a desired person or place. When trying to contact a friend, he often 
found himself in unexpected, unfamiliar surroundings. 
<P>I've also run into these problems. I think the problems stemmed mainly from 
my beliefs. I couldn't rationalize how people could move from place to place 
during OBEs, and my doubts and skepticism got in my way. I harbored a belief 
that it takes more than thoughts to travel. Limiting beliefs such as these can 
cause us a great deal of trouble. Here is an example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>12/22/85 Sun - OBE #120 
  <P>...Annoyed, I closed my eyes again, sat up again, turned and stood up 
  again. This time I walked blindly through the door into the living room. I 
  walked across the living room, almost to the door to the apartment. I thought, 
  "I'm far enough away from my body now; It should be safe to open my eyes." I 
  opened my eyes, and again I was transported back to the same position just 
  above the body. 
  <P>I figured this was happening because of some belief I harbored, so I 
  decided to combat the belief. As I lay there, I thought strongly, "I am the 
  master of my reality, and I control what happens here." With that thought, I 
  felt a strong sensation like a vibration that swept into me, giving me a sense 
  of power. 
  <P>I thought, "Good. Now, I will raise myself up with the power of my 
  thoughts." I used my mind to pull up, and I started forcefully rising up one 
  half foot...one foot... one and one-half feet. Then I questioned whether it 
  ought to work, since I hadn't had much luck in the past with this method. That 
  doubt caused me to stop rising, and I started gently bobbing up and down, as 
  if my conflicting beliefs were fighting each other, one pulling me up, the 
  other pushing me down. Then I blacked out. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The following experience illustrates further how we can use one set of 
beliefs to combat another set of beliefs: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>04/13/86 Sun - OBE #125 
  <P>This morning I was trying to sleep but kept thinking about trying to leave 
  my body. As I was heading toward sleep I found myself in a very good condition 
  for OBEs. I was laying on my left side. Very easily I started myself swaying 
  back and forth in my body, as described before. I swayed back and forth and 
  slipped outside my body. I thought, "Well, that was easy enough." I slipped a 
  little bit backward and found myself stuck to the body. I tried to pry myself 
  away, but was unsuccessful. I closed my eyes and said aloud, "I am in complete 
  control of this reality while I am out of my body. If I am stuck, it's because 
  I believe I am stuck. And I no longer want to be stuck." I opened my eyes 
  again and tried once more to pry myself away, also without success. 
  <P>I decided to try something different. My body was near the edge of the bed. 
  I reasoned that if I were close to the edge of the bed and pushed myself off, 
  I would fall off the bed, thus freeing myself from the body. I was using my 
  own beliefs to free myself: I knew I had a belief that I would fall off the 
  bed. This belief was stronger than my belief that I was stuck to my body. I 
  rolled a little bit until I was laying on my back (my body was still on its 
  left side). I wanted to fall gently, so I gently fell to the ground and I felt 
  a sharp--but not painful--jab in my back caused by hitting something on the 
  floor next to my bed. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The point is, if you are planning to attempt OBEs, it's very helpful, before 
you set out on your adventure, to examine your desires, beliefs, fears and 
expectations about the experience.

<H2>EXERCISE 22</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Buzzing</H3></CENTER>
<P>This exercise is similar to the musical imagination exercise. Relax 
completely, then try to get to that passive, quiesced frame of mind. 
<P>As vividly as you can, imagine there is a course buzzing sound in your head. 
Pretend the buzzing is just a little bit too quiet to hear, but getting louder. 
Simultaneously listen intently for the buzzing to become loud enough to hear. 
<P>As the buzzing becomes louder, imagine the sound is causing your soul to 
vibrate. Increase the imaginary sound until you feel like your soul is being 
rattled and shaken to the core. Hold the imaginary buzzing and vibrating for 
several minutes. 
<P>Repeat the procedure several times if necessary.
