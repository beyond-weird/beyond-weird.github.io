<H1>CHAPTER 12 </H1></CENTER>

<H2>Flight School</H2></CENTER>
<P>After reading so many books on out-of-body experiences, I had great 
enthusiasm about astral travel. After all, why hop a plane to the coast, when 
you can hop the astral plane to the ghost? But I tried everything I knew to 
travel with a thought, but nothing seemed to work. Perhaps my expectations had 
been too great. Perhaps science had been too deeply ingrained in me, and a part 
of me still believed traveling had to be more complex than thinking. 
<P>Whatever the reason, I decided to take a different approach to out-of-body 
transportation. Instead of trying to use my mind to teleport myself, I decided 
to fly the friendly skies! My first attempt at flight wasn't too disastrous, but 
not too coordinated either: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>01/27/81 Tue - OBE #32 
  <P>...Some unknown time in the night I woke up out of my body. I could not see 
  in the physical sense of the word, yet I knew where I was; I was in our back 
  alley, and I knew I was projecting. 
  <P>I thought, "Where should I go?" and immediately decided "To EJ" without 
  hesitation--I had decided this before I went to bed....So I took a running 
  leap and started off in the air. 
  <P>I rose above the houses quickly and was shaky for a while; I remembered 
  many flying dreams in which I have crashed. But I decided that if I controlled 
  my mind, I would be all right. I flew higher and higher, and was touched by a 
  little fear; I was afraid to fly too high. So I made effort to keep myself low 
  enough for my own comfort. I could see the roofs of houses, the trees, and 
  everything. 
  <P>When I first went up I realized I wasn't seeing physically, so I thought, 
  "I should see." Then I saw everything okay. I saw my arms raised in front of 
  me Superman-style. I started to climb too high for comfort and I became afraid 
  of getting too far away from Earth. 
  <P>With that thought, I started getting lower and lower. I descended very 
  quickly until I was forced to land. I landed okay in some street, on the slope 
  of a hill. I thought, "...Now I'll never get there!". The next thing I knew I 
  was dreaming again. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Nobody ever taught me how to fly, so I was proud of my first attempt. My next 
attempts were just as awkward, if not more so. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>05/08/82 Sat - OBE #72 
  <P>...I walked through the door and outside....It was bright and sunny 
  outside. The change was striking to me, since the room in which my body was 
  sleeping was dark. The sunlight didn't hurt my eyes; it just seemed very clear 
  and bright out. I thought, "Now where should I go to take off on a flight?" I 
  looked up and I saw the branches of our hackberry tree. I walked along our 
  sidewalk toward the west. 
  <P>I went to our front yard, and I stopped and faced the east (where our back 
  yard is). I looked all around. I was very embarrassed to be out in the public 
  where everyone could see me while about to take a flying leap in the air in an 
  attempt to fly. I knew that I couldn't be seen by anyone, but still I 
  hesitated, dreading the possibility that I might be seen. Such a flying 
  attempt would look pretty silly for a physical person. I took a few quick 
  steps toward the east and I leaped forward into a good flying position. For a 
  second or two I was completely weightless and I glided in midair for a few 
  feet. But then I stumbled and fell! I caught myself before I fell on my face. 
  <P>I decided to try again. This time I walked further west until I was on the 
  front sidewalk outside our house. I ran about five feet toward the south this 
  time (away from my house) and I took a flying leap into the air, after looking 
  around for neighbors who could see. I fell flat on my face again! It didn't 
  hurt because I was not physical, and so I picked myself back up. I decided to 
  walk to our back yard (east) and try [to fly] there once. I walked about ten 
  feet or so and I blacked out without any warning. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>07/02/82 Fri - OBE #77 
  <P>Early this morning I was dreaming. I dreamed that I was talking to someone 
  about astral projection. After the conversation ended, and I was back inside 
  my bedroom, I said to myself (still in a dream state), "That's an excellent 
  idea; I think I'll project." 
  <P>So in the dream, I stood up and went outside. I walked to the place just 
  behind (east of) my house and I woke up there out of my body! I realized my 
  condition, and I was surprised, but I stayed in perfect control of my 
  emotions: The dream had prepared me to be calm for the upcoming OBE. 
  <P>I was standing outside, facing east. I thought about recent failures with 
  astral levitation, but I said calmly to myself, "It's worth a try." With an 
  act of will, I started rising through the air, straight up, in an upright 
  position (standing). It startled me but I told myself, "Stay calm; it's no 
  biggie. I'm going to go for a nice, simple flying lesson. I'm not going to try 
  for a big adventure." 
  <P>I waited until I was about 15 feet in the air, then I said, "Okay; that's 
  high enough for now." The thought that I might not stop rising did cross my 
  mind, and it caused me to rise a bit further, but I said to myself, "It's 
  okay. Nothing bad can happen. I can't be harmed. I'm in control." So I stopped 
  in midair. I totally relaxed my astral body so I couldn't even feel it and I 
  propelled myself forward through the air toward the east with a mere thought 
  properly placed. 
  <P>I was slowly moving (flying) toward the east in a comfortable position. I 
  thought, "I'm totally relaxed. This is a great bodily position to be in for 
  flying." Then I looked down at my astral body, and I saw I was almost upright. 
  My arms were hanging down, my head was forward, and I was leaning forward 
  about 30 degrees. My legs were relaxed and naturally bent about 45 degrees. 
  The position I was in was almost exactly that of a 10-speed bicycle rider 
  except I was more upright and my arms were relaxed by my side. 
  <P>I wasn't too steady in my flying. I bobbed up and down, left and right, 
  trying to correct my direction of flight. I was moving slightly faster now, 
  and the ash tree in my yard was straight ahead of me. I tried to steer around 
  it, but I could not; I wasn't practiced enough at flying. I was just about to 
  hit the tree, when I wiggled my torso to the left (north) and my head managed 
  to miss hitting the tree. The rest of my body hit the tree, and much to my 
  surprise it bent around the tree, and slithered around it elastically like a 
  snake overcomes an obstacle. "Whew!" 
  <P>After that, there was nothing in my way. I started flying a little faster, 
  and I purposely climbed higher and higher. I climbed to about four-hundred 
  feet, then I descended back to about two-hundred feet, so that I could see the 
  scenery more closely. I looked down without any panic at all. I noticed that I 
  could see everything well--equally well as in the body, and very clearly. But 
  I saw there was no sun, and I felt it was dark out. I could see fine, however, 
  and everything appeared in a pale, almost gray light. It was like seeing a 
  picture from an infrared camera. 
  <P>I glided softly, somewhat slowly over the houses, eyeing the details of the 
  neighborhood houses. I kept a close eye on all the details of everything as I 
  moved, and I verified that I once again was in a real, waking situation. The 
  details didn't change, nor did my speed. And the tremendous detail I saw 
  around me, assured me I was seeing reality and not a dream. I reasoned that: 
  <OL>
    <LI>In dreams I notice very few details, only those that are necessary to 
    the immediate story unfolding around me. This wasn't a dream. Besides, I was 
    fully awake and conscious. 
    <LI>Even in ordinary reality we screen out and ignore most of the details of 
    our surroundings. So I knew I was experiencing reality with more clarity 
    than normal in-the-body life. 
    <LI>Since what I saw didn't change, (I was looking for changes) I knew my 
    eyesight was at least normal, and that I wasn't dreaming. Dreams have a bad 
    habit of changing the scenery to produce certain situations and emotions. 
    <LI>I verified and studied the details I saw below. The details were all the 
    same as waking life. </LI></OL>
  <P>I flew to the east about three city blocks. I looked to the north, and I 
  saw a man come out of a house that was on the north side of Lowry Avenue. He 
  stood and looked at me, up in the air. So I brought myself softly down across 
  the street, on the south side of Lowry, also to the west (I was now 
  kitty-corner to where he was standing). He walked across the street toward me, 
  and he came up to me. Just as he began to speak, I lost consciousness and 
  entered the dreamlike semiconscious state. In this state the man and I 
  exchanged a few words, and I lost consciousness. The man was about 30 years 
  old, with short brown, wavy hair, very friendly, with kind eyes. He wore 
  casual clothes. He was a little taller than me, perhaps six feet tall. I can't 
  remember anything we said while I was in the dreamlike semiconscious state. 
  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This OBE brings up a very important question: What's the difference between a 
lucid dream and an OBE? I do believe that occasionally people confuse one 
experience for the other. It's very difficult to tell the difference in some 
cases. Some people believe OBEs are poorly developed lucid dreams. Others 
believe lucid dreams are poorly developed OBEs. 
<P>A comparison of the two experiences is given in chapter 6 of With the Eyes of 
the Mind (An Empirical Analysis of Out-of-Body States) by Gabbard and Twemlow 
(1984). The authors found the following differences between OBEs and lucid 
dreams: 
<UL>
  <LI>Lucid dreams occur in 50%-70% of the population, whereas OBEs occur in 
  14%-25% of the population. 
  <LI>There are two types of lucid dream: The first type occurs during REM 
  sleep, and they are known as Dream Initiated Lucid Dreams (DILDs). The second 
  type occurs at the beginning phases of sleep, and they are called Wake 
  Initiated Lucid Dreams (WILDs). Both types of lucid dreams occur only during 
  sleep or the onslaught of sleep. Typical OBEs are initiated from a waking 
  state, much like WILDs are, but some OBEs unexpectedly occur from a waking 
  state. Several people have reported OBEs during which they have unexpectedly 
  "fallen out of their body" from total consciousness, as described in chapter 
  9. Some of these occur when the physical body is active, such as walking down 
  the street. 
  <LI>Lucid dreamers can consciously program their dream, whereas OBEers are 
  usually passive observers. 
  <LI>Lucid dreamers have an integrated body image, whereas OBEers view 
  themselves as separated from the physical body, which is inert and 
  thoughtless. 
  <LI>Lucid dreamers have consciousness that is vivid, even mystical, whereas 
  OBEers experience a more normal form of consciousness. 
  <LI>Lucid dreamers view their experience as a production of their mind, 
  whereas OBEers view the experience as objective reality. 
  <LI>Lucid dreamers have brain waves typical of dreaming, whereas OBEers don't 
  exhibit dream-like brain waves. 
  <LI>Lucid dreamers have Rapid Eye Movements (REMs), whereas they are not 
  observed during an OBE. 
  <LI>Lucid dreamers don't typically see their physical body, but OBEers usually 
  do. 
  <LI>In addition, the authors felt that fewer lucid dreams have a lasting 
  positive lasting impact on the subject, whereas OBEs usually a highly positive 
  lasting impact. 
  <LI>In a lucid dream, typically one does not dream about being in one's 
  bedroom, as is common in the out-of-body state. 
  <LI>After a lucid dream, the subject accepts the "unreality" of the lucid 
  dream after awakening. After an OBE, the subject usually asserts emphatically 
  that the experience was "real." 
  <LI>Many Lucid Dreams contain sexual content. In fact, author Patricia 
  Garfield indicates that "fully two-thirds" of her lucid dreams have sexual 
  content. Lucid dream sex is convincingly real; it feels the same as real sex. 
  OBEs, however, rarely have sexual content. When OBEers report having "astral 
  sex," the experience is not anything like physical sex. It's more like an 
  ecstatic mind-trip, a transfer of energy, or a euphoria, but it doesn't feel 
  like physical sex. 
  <LI>Lucid dreams--like normal dreams--are not easily remembered, unless one is 
  conditioned. Memory is a key factor of having Lucid Dreams. OBEs, however, are 
  usually remembered vividly for years, without prior conditioning. </LI></UL>
<P>Also, an out-of-body experience is a typical feature of a Near Death 
Experience (NDE). One can hardly think that Lucid Dreams occur during an NDE, 
especially because the physical body doesn't spontaneously go into REM sleep 
during an NDE. 
<P>Perhaps the most convincing argument is this: I've had lucid dreams in which 
I had complete control, then dispelled the dream only to wake up in an 
out-of-body state. When this happens I've noticed that the scenery in a lucid 
dream seems artificial, unlike OBE scenery. It's even possible to change the 
scenery with your mind. Here is an example: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>05/17/86 Sat - OBE #126 
  <P>This morning I was in the beginning of a dream in which I found myself 
  walking through the hallways of a hospital, and there were other people in the 
  hallways. I realized I was dreaming, and became lucid. 
  <P>First, I wanted to play with the lucid dream state for a little while, so I 
  started gliding through the hallway. Then I levitated my feet and began to fly 
  down the hospital corridor at a good speed. The hallway ended, but instead of 
  hitting the wall I decided to change my focus and create a tunnel that I could 
  fly down. With an act of will, a hole appeared in the wall ahead, and a tunnel 
  formed. The hospital scene slowly blended into a tunnel scene, the hallway 
  becoming the tunnel. In real life, a tunnel of this size (without lights) 
  would appear to be darker toward the end of the tunnel. The dream-tunnel I 
  created didn't seem to end, and it appeared lighter in the back and darker in 
  the front. There was a strange kind of grayish light, almost like a fog, that 
  obscured where the end of the tunnel. 
  <P>I started flying down the tunnel at a great speed, but I knew it was an 
  illusion. I got bored with flying, so I slowed myself down, lowered my feet 
  and focused myself back in the hospital. I was in the same hallway. I turned 
  and started floating myself back down the hallway in the opposite direction, 
  turned left, and down toward the main desk. Then I stopped completely and 
  decided that I didn't want the illusion of the dream anymore. 
  <P>I closed my eyes, to unfocus from the dream. The dream scenery melted away 
  and my vision went black. I was floating out of my body. Then I decided to 
  have some fun, and I started flying wildly in all directions, doing 
  loop-the-loops and having a ball. I turned about twenty loops of great size, 
  just like a jet airplane, but I was unable to open my eyes for some unknown 
  reason. Still, the sensation of flying was a blast. 
  <P>I was having great fun flying so freely, and I decided to try an 
  experiment: I decided to try to fly to the sun. I stopped and stood straight 
  up. I reached up over my head with an imaginary line of force, and I kept 
  reaching, trying to touch the sun with my line of force. When I decided that 
  my line of force had reached the surface of the sun, I tried to "feel" what it 
  was like at the end of the line. It really didn't feel any different, just a 
  little "denser" (that's the only way I can describe it.) 
  <P>Then I started pulling myself straight up, along that line of force, toward 
  the sun. I accelerated tremendously toward the sun, until I was traveling what 
  I felt to be near the speed of light. After about three minutes of this 
  tremendous speed I still didn't feel any change, so I stopped and I tried to 
  see where I was, but I wasn't able to see anything. With that, I blacked out 
  and woke up inside my body. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If I had remembered any astronomy from my childhood, I would have known it 
takes more than eight minutes traveling at the speed of light to reach the sun. 
And I might not have been traveling at the speed of light. 
<P>The difference between the out-of-body experience and the lucid dream is not 
always apparent. I guess you'll have to rely on your own sense of "real" and 
"not-real" to decide this for yourself. One thing is for sure: more scientific 
study is needed. It is premature to jump to the conclusion that "OBEs are 
actually variant interpretations of lucid dreams" as proposed by Stephen LaBerge 
in chapter 9 of his excellent book Lucid Dreaming.

<H2>EXERCISE 12</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<H3>Lucid Dreaming</H3></CENTER>
<P>Many OBE experts say that some part of our psyche is already familiar with 
the out-of-body experience. Many books claim that every night, some part of our 
psyche leaves our physical body and goes about work of its own. What happens 
then is so far removed from the physical world that we usually only remember 
bits and pieces of these journeys as "dreams." 
<P>During OBEs and lucid dreams your body is asleep, but unlike dreams, your 
consciousness is awake. Well, your body goes to sleep every night. Suppose you 
had a way to "wake up" your consciousness but leave your body asleep. You could 
turn an ordinary dream into an OBE. You could wake yourself up and say, "Wait a 
minute. I know this is a dream. I'm wide awake now." From there you could either 
keep dreaming and have a "Lucid dream," or wake yourself out of the dream and 
have an out-of-body experience. Both are fun. 
<P>Lucid dreams are great. You can literally do anything you want. You can 
remain completely conscious and do anything you can imagine. They're almost as 
fun as OBEs, but they're not as real. The scenery will be fake. OBEs, on the 
other hand, are sometimes more constraining, but they're real. 
<P>The problem is, when you're dreaming, you usually don't think to wake 
yourself up. In fact, you usually don't realize you're dreaming: You think 
you're awake. 
<P>Here's a simple exercise to help you get around that problem. Ask yourself in 
all seriousness, "Am I dreaming?" Well, are you? Maybe you're just dreaming 
about reading this book. So how do you know you're not dreaming all this? I want 
you to make sure you're not dreaming this. 
<P>If you ask yourself this question every fifteen minutes today, you'll 
probably ask yourself the same question tonight when you're dreaming. Daytime 
habits often carry over into dream habits. 
<P>You don't have to ask it every fifteen minutes, but the more often you ask, 
the more likely you are to catch yourself dreaming. You can set yourself a 
reminder, like your watch. How often do you look at a clock? Every time you look 
at a clock, try to figure out if you're dreaming. It won't take long. And it 
could be a life-changing experience! 
<P>So happy dreaming. And perhaps, happy OBEs!
