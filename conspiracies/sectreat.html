THE SECRET TREATY OF FORT HUNT
		   by Carl Oglesby


Read this article in conjunction with "How Allen Dulles and the
SS Preserved Each Other," and you'll have a pretty good idea of
how we got into the mess we're in today. This article from 
"Covert Action [Information Bulletin]" tells the story of ODESSA
and it's relationship to Reinhard Gehlen's spy organization 
which formed the basis of our modern Central Intelligence Agency
and National Security Council.  "The unconditional surrender 
that the Germans made to the Allied Command at the little red
schoolhouse in Reims was the surrender only of the German Armed
Services. It was NOT the surrender of the hard SS core of the
Nazi Party. The SS did not surrender, unconditionally or 
otherwise, and thus, Naziism itself did not surrender. The SS
chose, rather, to seek other means of continuing the war while
the right wing of the United States Military Establishment, 
through fears and secret passions and a naivet'e of its own,
chose to facilitate that choice. The history that we have lived
through since then stands witness to the consequences."
