  <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Background </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The color video footage, which lasts for a total 
  of two minutes and fifty-five seconds, was apparently smuggled out of the secret 
  Groom Lake "Area 51" facility in Nevada by a man referring to himself as "Victor".The 
  video film depicts a Grey alien being interrogated at the government facility. 
  </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The footage first came to light on the Art Bell radio 
  show on 13th March, 1997 when ufologist Sean David Morton was interviewed. Morton 
  claimed the interrogation was fairly recent, sometime in 1996, and that renowned 
  UFO expert Bob Dean apparently cried at the advanced screening of the film. 
  </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> After claiming to have smuggled the film out of the 
  Groom Lake facility in Nevada, Victor resolved to have the footage broadcast 
  on network television as soon as possible in order to pulicly expose his claims. 
  Victor believes that if his identity is discovered and he is subsequently assassinated, 
  this would only further help to confirm the claims and authenticity behind the 
  film. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Victor approached many television companies in his 
  attempts to show the footage to the public. He first approached Fox TV, who 
  turned him down after the problems in authenticity they had when the Roswell 
  autopsy footage was shown by them. Fox felt they were being deceived for a second 
  time. Eventually, in July 1996, Victor found an independent production company 
  in Los Angeles, California called Rocket Home Pictures Productions, who agreed 
  to produce a documentary based around the interview. Morton was brought in by 
  Rocket's president, Tom Coleman, to give his views, thus being the first "outsider" 
  to view the footage. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Contents Of The Video </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> After seeing the interview footage, Morton provides 
  a chilling and detailed description of what he saw: </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"The film was shot through a large plane of glass. 
  There was no sound accompanying the images. The interview took place in a darkened 
  room, lit with an eerie greenish glow, I could make out the silhouettes of two 
  men, one dressed in military uniform with what appeared to be the stars on the 
  epaulet of his jacket, and another more casually dressed man with his hand occassionally 
  rubbing his forehead. They sat with their backs to the camera at one end of 
  a long table, which was littered with wires, chords and microphones. There were 
  what appeared to be medical devices. One in particular was blinking erratically, 
  as if it was monitoring a very sick heart. And there sitting at the end of the 
  table was a small, beige-skinned, black-eyed, bulbous headed creature, the like 
  of which haunt the nightmares of thousands of unwilling abductees." </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Morton made many references to the creature's sick 
  appearance and condition. The alien made very jerky movements and kept bobbing 
  up and down. He continued to describe the apparently distressed state the creature 
  was in. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"Its skin was a pinkish beige, but the rest of the 
  head looked purple and bruised, as if it had suffered severe contusions across 
  the skull." </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The contents of the tape grew progressively more 
  disturbing. Towards the end of the tape, the creature goes into what appears 
  to be violent spasms, as if it was having a seizure. The mouth of the alien 
  opens and closes before a foam begins to come out. At that point the heart monitor 
  (as described by Morton) begins to start jumping wildly, at which point the 
  man in the military looking uniform signals to a couple of medics, who rush 
  into the frame and aid the alien. As the doctors treat the alien, the footage 
  suddenly comes to an abrupt end. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Fact or Fiction? </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The authenticity of the footage is seen differently 
  by many people. Morton is convinced the footage is real due to strong relationships 
  with stories of alien abductees and the information on the footage in the lower 
  part of the frame. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> I myself am dubious, but do recognise the factors 
  which lead to its possible true authenticity. The ET's appearance and features 
  are recognisable as those mentioned by hundreds of abductees. Known as "The 
  Gourdos" or the more feared "Grey" species, the alien is instantly recognisable 
  by any Ufologist. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Another factor helping the video's authenticity is 
  the information etched into the bottom of the video. </font></b>

  <b><font color="#FFFFFF">The footage has the characters DNI/27 burnt into the 
  bottom line of the frame, along with what appears to be the time code numbers 
  for date, minutes and seconds. The letters DNI could be an acronym for the Department 
  of Naval Intelligence, the group responsible for the Area 51 base, a fact not 
  many people know about. The DNI connection to Area 51 has been widely investigated. 
  George Knapp, the TV journalist who encouraged Bob Lazar to go public with his 
  knowledge has shown that Lazar's pay cheques from the time he claimed to be 
  working at Area 51 had DNI stamped on them. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Victor's Reasoning </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The best place to possibly determine the authenticity 
  of the alien interview footage is the source, in this case a mysterious man 
  known as Victor who won't reveal ANY specific details about himself in fear 
  of discovery and assassination. If the man is telling the truth about his background 
  at Area 51, then this is understandable. But how can the film be verified without 
  any knowledge of it? </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The producer of the documentary, Jeff Broadstreet, 
  does know how Victor took the footage from the base. Victor told him he managed 
  to obtain a copy of the video when in an unsupervised moment. Broadstreet stated 
  the following: </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"He was assisting in the process of downloading a 
  large amount of video analogue tape to storage on DVD or digital video disc." 
  </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> He further explains that Victor deliberately removed 
  the audio track to protect the identity of the men in the video and to also 
  help protect his own anonymity. Victor also told the producer that he thought 
  the man on the left, who is seen with his hand to his head during much of the 
  segment, is a military telepath apparently used to assist in communication with 
  the creature. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Since the creature is obviously in a great deal of 
  distress, when Broadstreet asked if the creature died later, Victor replied 
  cryptically, "I'm not sure, but I know it was retired from the interview process." 
  </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> According to Victor, the contents of the removed 
  audio track involved an attempt at trying to obtain some form of technological 
  information from the alien about the coordinates of a ship or object. He does 
  not know, or wouldn't tell, whether the alien was attending the interview voluntarily 
  or against his will after he had been recovered from some UFO crash retrieval 
  operation. </font></b>
