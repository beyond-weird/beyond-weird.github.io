<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Among the mysteries of modern ufology is the origin 
  of the entities known as the Greys. These small beings are the most commonly 
  observed entities reported by abductees aboard extraterrestrial craft, and are 
  believed to be the ones most responsible for human abductions. There are many 
  things that we do know about the Greys, derived mostly from abductee reports, 
  but there is far more that we do not yet know or understand. Using the evidence 
  at hand, including a collective of abductee reports and stolen government files, 
  it is now possible to make accurate estimates of several aspects of the lives 
  of the Greys, including physiological and mental aspects. </font></b>
<P> <b><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Current Theories:</font> </b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">The Majestic Twelve: </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> One of the currently held beliefs about the Greys 
  is that they are connected somehow to the United States government, and that 
  this intimate relationship has resulted in many of the technological leaps of 
  the last fifty years made by military and government science, including the 
  F-117 stealth fighter and B-2 stealth bomber, as well as a weapons systems known 
  as Joshua, a ultrasonic weapon, of which a recently declassified research-wave 
  study variant was displayed to the public. The theory goes something like this: 
  A secret group within the government (known as the Majestic Twelve, or the Jason 
  Society, or the Jason Scholars) has given the Greys several large tracts of 
  land in the American Southwest, near the Four Corners area, on which to build 
  large underground bases, know as DUMBs (Deep Underground Military Bases). From 
  these locations, the Greys are able to abduct their targets with much more ease 
  and less observability than they would otherwise be able to do, resulting from 
  a closer location to the abduction sites, thus resulting in decreased flight 
  time, which translates to less time available for detection by others. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> This is known as the 'Alien-United States Government 
  Technological Exchange Theory,' and is currently popular, in varying degrees, 
  among many researchers and others, who believe that the government is constantly 
  lying about its involvement in the UFO phenomenon, and is keeping much information 
  secret, while using disinformation tactics to make all eyewitnesses appear to 
  be fooling. The disinformation appears in various forms, from government propaganda, 
  lies about activities, and threats to silence witnesses, to the more vocal and 
  outspoken of 'researchers' who attempt to convince others that there is no UFO 
  phenomenon, and no such thing as extraterrestrial life. These 'debunkers' use 
  any explanation, no matter how unlikely and impossible, to explain any and all 
  sightings. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> There are many documents and eyewitnesses currently 
  available that directly and indirectly implicate the government in conspiracy 
  after conspiracy, the least of which are the event at Roswell and the assassination 
  of John F. Kennedy. These documents do tend to point towards a "Secret Government" 
  which controls much of what we perceive to be our benefactors. Congress, to 
  the best of our knowledge, has not been deeply infiltrated, due to the fact 
  that the members are elected by the people. This makes it possible for any involved 
  officials to be voted out of office. It is possible, however, that various government 
  agencies may set up these candidates and rig elections to gain Congressmen who 
  favor their plans. Congress's activities, however, do not appear to be suspect, 
  except for the usual political logrolling and campaigning. State governments 
  are also for the most part safe from very deep infiltration, due to the fact 
  that the "Secret Government" must be a small group in order to remain secret. 
  Taking over state governments would not only increase the chances of detection, 
  due to an increase in the number of people directly involved, and the proportionate 
  number of people indirectly involved, but also cause problems in the maintenance 
  of the government. The number of people who have direct access to the leaders 
  of such a group would increase exponentially as the number of leaders increase. 
  This would have the effect of drastically increasing chances of accidental public 
  knowledge of their existence. Thus, a "Secret Government" could function at 
  its best on a nation level. The end result of such as large project would be: 
  </font></b>
<P> 
<UL>
  <LI><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> A population who, as a whole, tends to consider 
    any who study this phenomenon, as well as most witnesses, as 'crackpots and 
    lunatics' </font> </b>
    <P> 
  <LI><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> A group of trained disinformation agents used 
    to keep the public's mind off of such matters </font> </b>
    <P> 
  <LI><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Relative security in operations that would otherwise 
    be viewed with great mistrust. This would be the precise effect wanted by 
    this group, because its motives, as well as its actual operations would be 
    hidden from the population in general, as well as to the rest of the government. 
    </font></b>
</UL>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Beings of Light: </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Another popular theory held by many involved in New 
  Age philosophy is that the Greys are truly the benevolent race they claim to 
  be, and that they are here to guide humanity into the next millennium with spiritual 
  understanding of each other, in order to create a more perfect society. It also 
  finds support among those who claim to be in contact with the Greys, and claim 
  to receive information about what they are doing, as well as why. This information, 
  however, seems to be too much like propaganda as well as disinformation to the 
  author. This theory holds that the Greys come from a society whose gene pool 
  has become overly inbred or otherwise has become depleted. It is somewhat similar 
  to the old science fiction scenario, with a dying Mars coming to Earth in order 
  that they can survive. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> This theory is much simpler, as well as much more 
  direct in its thought process, than the one above, and is entertained more by 
  various groups devoted to the spiritual and mental evolution of mankind. Supporters 
  of this theory say that the same Greys have spoken to them, and told them the 
  reasons that they are here. According to these individuals and groups, the Greys 
  are trying to help humanity save itself by saving the planet, because the death 
  of Earth is soon to come, and tell of great storms, earthquakes, floods, volcanic 
  eruptions, as well as war, pollution, famine, and starvation that will soon 
  to sweep across the face of our planet. The Greys claim that they know these 
  things will happen because they aren't limited by time flowing in a single direction, 
  but can move forwards and backwards though time. While they cannot stop it, 
  they only want to prevent as much suffering as possible. While they are here, 
  though, they could use some of our DNA, because their supply has been drastically 
  reduced, for a reason rarely told to the contactees who communicate to them. 
  </font></b>
<P> <b><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Analysis of Theories:</font> </b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> These theories both have their various sources, and 
  both have evidence that supports one theory, while detracting from the other. 
  The author's personal views lean towards the first theory, due to several key 
  points of evidence. Most of the evidence for the Grey-government conspiracy 
  comes from sources within the government, and from careful observation and analysis 
  of government activities over the past 50 years. The benevolent Grey belief 
  comes directly from the Greys, who have implanted into their abductees' minds 
  certain instructions and ideas to give to society at various times, as they 
  determine. Using the abductees as 'virtual recorders,' the Greys claim that 
  they are here to 'help humanity realize its potential,' and to 'watch over humanity.' 
  The government files, on the other hand, claim the Greys are adept liars, and 
  they are not to be trusted. This data comes from the few applicable documents 
  gleamed from the military using the Freedom of Information Act, as well as former 
  and current government workers who claim to have broken their oaths of silence 
  and come forward to tell the truth. Admittedly, the government is also run by 
  accomplished liars, so it is a choice of whether to believe a totally alien 
  group, or to believe the US government (Many would have a difficult time with 
  this, and the author is one of those). </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> If the Greys are telling the truth, then we have 
  little to be worried about, except for our own government, and the occasional 
  abduction in the middle of the night. If they are lying, then we are faced with 
  a great dilemma: the people of the world are being manipulated without their 
  knowledge by at least two forces, the Greys and at least one major world government, 
  that of the United States. </font></b>
<P> <b><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Analysis of Reasons for Human Abductions:</font> 
  </b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> From the various documents, informants, and abductee 
  reports, we can postulate what the Greys are. There are many reports that can 
  be found today, if one knows where to look: Some theorize that the Greys are 
  descendants of modern humans from the future; others state that the Greys are 
  a totally different lifeform not related to Terran humans. This document will 
  hopefully finalize the various theories, and weed out those hypotheses that 
  are deemed highly unlikely due to contradicting evidence and reports. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Abductions and Cloning: </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> First of all, the fact must be established that the 
  Greys truly are clones. This is not a new theory, simply a modification of others 
  that have been circulating for a while. There are several reasons why they appear 
  to be clones, if one takes into account behavioral patterns and visual appearances, 
  as deduced from abductee testimonies and other related reports. However, the 
  most intriguing evidence is their abduction plans themselves, and not merely 
  second- and third-hand reports from semi-reliable witnesses about 'tanks of 
  human and alien body parts' somewhere in the deserts of New Mexico. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The Greys are abducting human males and females for 
  the purposes of extracting sperm, ova, and other samples of our genetic sequences 
  for reasons unknown. There does appear to be an answer as to why they do so, 
  if the relevant data is taken into consideration, as the reader shall soon see. 
  </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The Greys must be clones, and the best evidence is 
  in the conduct of the abductions. One can extrapolate from the Heisenburg Uncertainty 
  Principle (which refers to quantum mechanics and the uncertainty of the location 
  and momentum of an electron in an orbital) that genetic sequences break down 
  and begin to have errors in the sequence after several generations of continuous 
  cloning from clones, which is what many believe is occurring with the Greys. 
  The result of cloning from clones, after several generation, is equivalent to 
  inbreeding, where errors creep up in the code, so to speak, and eventually, 
  clones are created that are unable to function, i.e., stillborn. This phenomenon 
  is also likened to the recording of a audio or video cassette from another recording. 
  As copies are made from copies, the overall quality decreases. This postulate 
  can be extrapolated from the fact the as the human DNA chain is very long, and 
  contains much data. If the Greys have a similar genetic code, this hypothesis 
  will still stand. Humans have great genetic variation, and mutations from one 
  generation to the next increase the diversity. However, the mutations that are 
  created generally don't involve the function of major systems of the body. Sexual 
  reproduction is also a buffer to radical mutations affecting the entire body 
  in drastic ways from the norm. With clones, however, the mutations, while small 
  individually, will be copied from one generation to another, and as the number 
  of mutations build up, the greater the chance of a fatal mutation. The sheer 
  complexity of the DNA molecule (in humans) makes it exceedingly difficult to 
  keep tract of every bit of genetic code, and so errors will slip past investigations. 
  There is another problem In this situation: While the Greys seem to be able 
  to successfully cross-breed their genetic material with that of Terran humans, 
  their actual knowledge of truly advanced genetic engineering concepts seems 
  to be lacking. They are not able to manipulate their (or human) genetic code 
  beyond that necessary for the mixing of the two types of replicating molecules. 
  This implies that they either lost the knowledge somehow, or never had it in 
  the first place. Either way, it appears what the Greys don't have very much 
  control over the genetic code of the hybrid created. Thus, cloning from clones 
  creates a dilemma that is fatal to a species dependent on cloning as a method 
  of survival. The way that they propagate is also the method of their death as 
  a species. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> However, it may be possible, with the genetic engineering 
  techniques that the Greys seem to possess, to infuse viable DNA or other genetic 
  material, suitably modified, into their own next generation of clones, thus 
  creating hybrids and others much like those often reported by abductees. While 
  some may say that if they have the technology to do all that, why not create 
  the genetic materials they need and repair their genetic code themselves without 
  resorting to abducting humans? The answer is very simple, and is a matter of 
  economics: It is by far cheaper, energy- wise and time-wise, to 'harvest' the 
  DNA needed, rather than create the genetic materials themselves. Why spend energy 
  and time building factories, setting codes of purity, as well as finding a source 
  of raw materials for the creation of the replicating molecule, and then reconstruct 
  an entire, functional molecule, when there is a planet of six billion humans 
  which do the job themselves, naturally? The strategic location of underground 
  bases could make this far more economically advantageous, but even a civilization 
  that is FTL-capable, traveling from a distant star, would save time and energy 
  as opposed to massive efforts create a replicating molecule from scratch. Thus, 
  this theory would not only explain current abductions, but also past visitations 
  as well, due to the premise that the abductions are for the purposes of harvesting 
  DNA and other genetic materials for infusion into their own genetic code. There 
  does appear to be a problem in this situation: While the Greys seem to be able 
  to successfully cross-breed their genetic material with that of Terran humans, 
  their actual knowledge of truly advanced genetic engineering concepts seems 
  to be lacking. They are not able to manipulate their (or human) genetic code 
  beyond that necessary for the mixing of the two type of replicating molecules. 
  This implied that they either lost the knowledge somehow, or never had it in 
  the first place. Either way, it appears what the Greys don't have very much 
  control over the genetic code of the hybrid created. The reason for this deduction 
  comes from an analysis of the fact that abductions are occurring: If the Greys 
  had advanced genetic engineering knowledge that they actively used to the extent 
  that they appear to, then it would be plausible that they would be able to repair 
  the errors in the genetic code as they appeared. This is contrary to the fact 
  that abductions are occurring, and so other hypotheses must be made to account 
  for this deviation from the expected. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> One possible explanation is that the Greys do not 
  do the genetic engineering themselves, but that the system is completely automated, 
  with or without a supervisor. In this manner, the genetic engineering involved 
  in combining both types of genetic code would be contained in a computer of 
  some type, and would create a hybrid embryo from human ova or sperm, with the 
  addition of Grey genetic material suitably modified to be compatible with Terran 
  DNA. One possible method, which would explain the taking of both sperm and ova, 
  would be the following scenario: The ova are modified only very slightly, to 
  make sure of no compatibility problems with the new set of genetic code. The 
  DNA from the human sperm is then removed, and replaced with the Grey genetic 
  material modified to interact accordingly. The sperm is then allowed to combine 
  with the ova, 'mixing' the two gene patterns, and if the code is viable, the 
  resultant embryo grows and divides. At a certain time, the embryo would be put 
  into stasis, by freezing or by another means, for storage, and implanted into 
  a human female mother for further development whenever convenient. This scenario 
  would circumvent the apparent 'hole' in the theory, and would explain why the 
  Greys seem to have advanced genetic engineering technology at their disposal, 
  yet be unable to repair errors in their genetic code, nor diversify their own 
  code through such manipulation. They have either lost the knowledge sometime 
  in the past, or simply used the knowledge that another civilization gave them, 
  without understanding what exactly was going on. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Physical Appearances: </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Other evidence comes from abductee reports on the 
  physical appearance of the Greys. According to abductees and certain government 
  informants, the following physical profile can be deduced about the Greys: The 
  average height of 4 ft. to 4 ft. 6 in. for the 'doctors,' or the leaders of 
  the abductions, and 3 ft. to 3 ft. 6 in. for the workers or 'drones,' with an 
  overall humanoid shape. Their skin coloration is light grey to dark grey and 
  appears to be non-porous. The head is proportionally large and an inverted triangular 
  shape in the vertical plane. The rear skull area is large and rounded, and the 
  eyes being large and slanted upwards toward the rear of the skull. The arms 
  and legs appear to be very thin, with a neck that appears to be far too thin 
  to support the weight of the head. There is no genitalia visible on the ones 
  that appear to be male, nor is there a pubic bulge seen through the clothing. 
  These reports seem to point to the same conclusion: The Greys are sterile mules, 
  with no sexual organs. Descriptions of Grey bodies illustrate their sameness: 
  very similar bodies, with only slight changes in proportions, and stylistic 
  differences being observed in their heads. However, even without sexual organs, 
  the Greys seem to have gender, and are not simply neuter. The genders, however, 
  appear to be completely determined by the mind, with the bodies being almost 
  identical. Abductees report that some Greys 'feel' or 'seem' feminine, while 
  others are very masculine. This seems to point to a time of sex differentiation, 
  which was bred out physically, leaving only the mental pattern to demonstrate 
  the differences between males and females in the Grey social infrastructure. 
  It should also be noted that female Greys are very rarely seen, and are reported 
  to be sterile and incapable of giving birth to offspring. The males are the 
  ones most commonly observed, and simple deduction will show that there is one 
  scenario possible: the Grey females are few in number, and must be isolated 
  for some reason, perhaps to prevent their loss or for genetic repositories. 
  Nevertheless, because Greys cannot breed naturally, due to a lack of sexual 
  organs, artificial methods must be incorporated into their society on a massive, 
  if not simply large, scale to prevent their demise as a species. </font></b>
<P> <b><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Origins from Cetaceans:</font> </b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Based on the evidence of their physical appearance, 
  the following hypothesis can be made: The Greys are descended from a dolphin-like 
  or cetacean-based life form. There are several reasons for this supposition. 
  The answer can be found in the similarities between cetaceans and Greys, using 
  physical and behavioral aspects. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Physical Aspects and Similarities: </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> First, let us examine the physical characteristics. 
  The skin of a Grey is very similar to that of dolphins in texture, and in most 
  cases, coloration. On Terra, cetaceans evolved legs and arms to function on 
  land, but when they returned to the oceans, the arms and legs evolved into flippers 
  and tails. X-ray analysis clearly show the residual appendages in modern day 
  dolphins and whales as being comparable in skeletal structure to that of land-dwelling 
  mammals in placement and types of bones. It is possible that the Greys evolved 
  much like Terran dolphins did, but did not return to the oceans, but continued 
  to develop as a land based mammal. Next is the skull shape: The Greys have a 
  large rounded skull region area on the upper anterior and posterior sections 
  of their skulls. An examination of the dolphin skull shows very similar large, 
  rounded anterior and posterior areas. The eyes of Greys are described as large 
  and black, with what appears to be a protective shielding covering the eye. 
  Many Terran aquatic animals have developed protective outer eye shields for 
  underwater use. It is possible that this is a left-over attribute from the Greys' 
  ocean origins which has not been bred out, perhaps due to several unknown advantages 
  of the shield. Another factor is the dark coloration of this eye shield. It 
  suggests an eye structure suited for a reduced light environment. In the oceans, 
  this would be natural for a creature living underwater were the planet's primary's 
  light does not penetrate very deep. The dark coloration would in indicative 
  of eyes that absorb nearly all the light that enters it, creating the appearance 
  of blackness. On Terra, dolphins and other cetaceans developed sonar ability 
  as their primary navigational aid, and thus do not rely as much on sight while 
  underwater. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Behavioral Aspects and Similarities </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> There are also several similarities in the behavior 
  of Greys and dolphins. Terran dolphins use sonar both to navigate and stun prey 
  and enemies. The stun affect is of particular interest in this case. Dolphins 
  can emit very powerful and focused ultrasonic bursts from the anterior section 
  of their skulls, from an organ known as a 'melon'. This is used to stun prey 
  and enemies, such as sharks and barracuda. There has been an excellent film 
  created by a group of students while diving, illustrating a group of dolphins 
  utilizing this ability on a very large barracuda. The barracuda was swimming 
  towards a group of very young dolphins. Four large adult dolphins turned so 
  that there heads were directly aligned with the barracuda, and emitted a sustained 
  ultrasonic burst. The effect on the barracuda was astounding. It literally froze, 
  completely paralyzed in the water, and even the gills ceased to move. The dolphins 
  stared at it for about thirty seconds, during which time the barracuda remained 
  totally immobilized. As soon as they turned their heads away, the ultrasonic 
  beam was no longer focused on the barracuda, whereas it fled at a very high 
  rate of speed from the scene. Obviously, this beam was tightly focused, and 
  required the dolphin's head to be pointed directly at the target. The strength 
  of the beam could be changed as well. When hunting, the ultrasound beam could 
  be directed at small fish and amplified to lethal levels, causing instant death. 
  Some cetacean researchers believe that this is also used when dolphins ram sharks. 
  Autopsies of the shark corpses after a dolphin attack reveal the sharks internal 
  organs have been visibly shattered. The beam can also be controlled so as to 
  produce a stun effect, as in the case of the barracuda. The result was physical 
  paralysis and disorientation. This phenomenon is very similar to the technique 
  used by the Greys as an aid to telepathic control of abductees. The similarities 
  are almost overwhelming. Nearly every abductee states that when they are abducted, 
  they are paralyzed by the Greys, and become mentally disorientated. The most 
  striking thing most recall is what is known as the 'Stare.' This occurs when 
  a Grey looks directly at an abductee, whereas the large, dark eyes capture the 
  abductee's attention immediately. Abductees then report being unable to move, 
  and a feeling of great mental disorientation. On some rare occasions, abductees 
  report a lessening of these effects when a Grey looked slightly away from them. 
  This clearly indicates that the intensity of the effect was directly proportional 
  to the direction or focus of the front portion of the Grey head. This evidence 
  leads to the hypothesis that the Greys use a kind of ultrasonic sound beam in 
  conjunction with telepathy to paralyze an abductee during an abduction. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The 'Stare" as abductees call it, is merely the positioning 
  of the Grey's anterior skull area, the projection area where the Grey equivalent 
  to the cetacean 'melon' is located, to achieve maximum beam concentration on 
  the abductee. When the Grey looks away, the beam would naturally become less 
  focused and the effect would diminish, just as it appears when the Grey is distracted 
  momentarily. The description of the Grey's head is usually large, triangular 
  and rounded in front and back. This suggests a large and rounded rear and frontal 
  brain lobe structure. This is exceedingly similar to the physical structure 
  of a cetacean brain. It is the main difference between cetacean and human brains. 
  This large rounding is thought to be an adaptation of the cetacean brain to 
  handle the enormous data flow received from echo-location and other sound-based 
  communications faculties. It should also be noted that on the rare occasions 
  that abductees hear verbal sounds from Greys, it is described as high-pitched, 
  sometimes chattering or staccato clicks or beeps. These are all similar to the 
  air vocalizations of dolphins. While the brain structure of the Greys has remained 
  basically constant, it can be assumed that the echo-location ability of the 
  Greys would have been decreased or atrophied almost completely. After all, there 
  is probably little use for echo-location is such a society, thus it could have 
  been bred out of the species during cloning. </font></b>
<P> <b><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Origins of Greys:</font> </b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Due to no knowledge at all of the origins of the 
  Greys, either as simply evolved cetaceans, or as a cloned slave society, several 
  possible avenues must be explored. A few that might be possible are simple evolution 
  with later genetic self-manipulation or manipulation of cetaceans by an outside 
  species. Since there is no evidence, albeit no data at all, any possible origins 
  theory that can be developed should be judged as possibly faulty, until more 
  data can be gathered. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Evolved Cetaceans: </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> A simple explanation for the origins of the Greys 
  would be and evolutionary process similar to that of humans, but from a cetacean 
  ancestor as opposed to a primate ancestor. At one point, instead of returning 
  to the oceans, or perhaps leaving the oceans, cetacean simply evolved as a land-dweller, 
  while retaining the vestigial features of it's ancestors, much as humans still 
  retain body hair, an appendix, and a group of fused tail bones. At another time, 
  the species evolved more rapidly, created a technological base of fire (not 
  possible underwater), and created a complex society. Some time later, the Greys 
  either had a large accident or other event that severely degenerated its genetic 
  pool, or decided that the random genetic mixing of sexual reproduction was inadequate 
  for their society, and embarked on cloning as a means to overcome their problem. 
  After a period of time, the knowledge of advanced genetics, as well as the technology 
  needed to created more advanced versions of their genetic machines were somehow 
  lost, and the result is a society that depends on its machines for species survival, 
  but who cannot recreate the technology. This theory is supported by the reasons 
  behind the abduction phenomenon, as is very streamlined, without involving other 
  species as manipulators. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">The Masters: </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Another of the theories possible begins with a cetacean 
  life form evolved on another planet. Unlike Terran cetaceans, they did not return 
  to the oceans, but were discovered and later altered and cloned by another species. 
  This species (called the Masters for argument's sakes), needed a source of slave 
  labor, and thus searched for an intelligent lesser species that they could genetically 
  manipulate in order to be used effectively. Arbitrarily assuming that this period 
  of time was about one million years ago, the most evolved species at that time 
  on Terra would have been dolphins and whales. This might also have been possible 
  on another planet, where a similar species evolved instead of a primate-like 
  organism. Under this theory, the cetacean ancestors of the Greys were taken 
  and genetically altered into an upright, bipedal species capable of doing labor 
  for the Masters. After a time, however, the Greys apparently rebelled, and are 
  now on their own, using the technology of the Masters, but since they were created 
  to simply operate them, and not to design them, their knowledge of the technology's 
  operation is lacking. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> This theory would explain the lack of knowledge of 
  genetics that the Greys seem to suffer from, and why they can't simply make 
  their own genetic code artificially more diverse. They are able to manipulate 
  the technology, and use it to their advantage, but are unable to understand 
  the actual theoretical aspects and operations behind the use of their equipment, 
  thus resulting in a need for abduction of humans. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> (Another possibility is the Grey's may not be independent 
  of their Masters, who may continue to control and manipulate the Greys for their 
  own reasons. In this scenario, the Masters are often considered to be the Reptilians.) 
  </font></b>
<P> <b><font size="3" color="#FFFFFF">Conclusions:</font> </b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The final conclusions deduced from the evidence at 
  hand is that the Greys were artificially developed either by persons or beings 
  unknown, or by themselves, and that the Greys evolved from a cetacean-like life 
  form on another world. A cetacean-like life form developed naturally on that 
  planet, and either evolved naturally, or was accelerated in their evolution 
  artificially though genetic engineering, and later cloning, which became their 
  only form of reproduction. Because of the cloning, their genetic sequence degrades 
  after each cloning of a clone, thus leading to the reason for the abduction 
  of Terran humans, as a method of repairing the damage in their own DNA (or other 
  genetic material), as well as adding new sequences to the cloning gene pool.
