<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">XXXIV</H1>
THE fall of his lord he was fain to requite<BR>
in after days; and to Eadgils he proved<BR>
friend to the friendless, and forces sent<BR>
over the sea to the son of Ohtere,<BR>
weapons and warriors: well repaid he<BR>
those care-paths cold when the king he slew.[1]<BR>
Thus safe through struggles the son of Ecgtheow<BR>
had passed a plenty, through perils dire,<BR>
with daring deeds, till this day was come<BR>
that doomed him now with the dragon to strive.<BR>
With comrades eleven the lord of Geats<BR>
swollen in rage went seeking the dragon.<BR>
He had heard whence all the harm arose<BR>
and the killing of clansmen; that cup of price<BR>
on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder.<BR>
In the throng was this one thirteenth man,<BR>
starter of all the strife and ill,<BR>
care-laden captive; cringing thence<BR>
forced and reluctant, he led them on<BR>
till he came in ken of that cavern-hall,<BR>
the barrow delved near billowy surges,<BR>
flood of ocean. Within 'twas full<BR>
of wire-gold and jewels; a jealous warden,<BR>
warrior trusty, the treasures held,<BR>
lurked in his lair. Not light the task<BR>
of entrance for any of earth-born men!<BR>
Sat on the headland the hero king,<BR>
spake words of hail to his hearth-companions,<BR>
gold-friend of Geats. All gloomy his soul,<BR>
wavering, death-bound. Wyrd full nigh<BR>
stood ready to greet the gray-haired man,<BR>
to seize his soul-hoard, sunder apart<BR>
life and body. Not long would be<BR>
the warrior's spirit enwound with flesh.<BR>
Beowulf spake, the bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>
"Through store of struggles I strove in youth,<BR>
mighty feuds; I mind them all.<BR>
I was seven years old when the sovran of rings,<BR>
friend-of-his-folk, from my father took me,<BR>
had me, and held me, Hrethel the king,<BR>
with food and fee, faithful in kinship.<BR>
Ne'er, while I lived there, he loathlier found me,<BR>
bairn in the burg, than his birthright sons,<BR>
Herebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine.<BR>
For the eldest of these, by unmeet chance,<BR>
by kinsman's deed, was the death-bed strewn,<BR>
when Haethcyn killed him with horny bow,<BR>
his own dear liege laid low with an arrow,<BR>
missed the mark and his mate shot down,<BR>
one brother the other, with bloody shaft.<BR>
A feeless fight,[2] and a fearful sin,<BR>
horror to Hrethel; yet, hard as it was,<BR>
unavenged must the atheling die!<BR>
Too awful it is for an aged man<BR>
to bide and bear, that his bairn so young<BR>
rides on the gallows. A rime he makes,<BR>
sorrow-song for his son there hanging<BR>
as rapture of ravens; no rescue now<BR>
can come from the old, disabled man!<BR>
Still is he minded, as morning breaks,<BR>
of the heir gone elsewhere;[3] another he hopes not<BR>
he will bide to see his burg within<BR>
as ward for his wealth, now the one has found<BR>
doom of death that the deed incurred.<BR>
Forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son,<BR>
wine-hall waste and wind-swept chambers<BR>
reft of revel. The rider sleepeth,<BR>
the hero, far-hidden;[4] no harp resounds,<BR>
in the courts no wassail, as once was heard.<BR>

[1] That is, Beowulf supports Eadgils against Onela, who is slain by Eadgils
in revenge for the "care-paths" of exile into which Onela forced him.<BR>
[2] That is, the king could claim no wergild, or man-price, from one son
for the killing of the other.<BR>
[3] Usual euphemism for death. <BR>
[4] Sc. in the grave.<BR>
