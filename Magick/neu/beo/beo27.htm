BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:--<BR>
"Lo, we seafarers say our will,<BR>
far-come men, that we fain would seek<BR>
Hygelac now. We here have found<BR>
hosts to our heart: thou hast harbored us well.<BR>
If ever on earth I am able to win me<BR>
more of thy love, O lord of men,<BR>
aught anew, than I now have done,<BR>
for work of war I am willing still!<BR>
If it come to me ever across the seas<BR>
that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee, --<BR>
as they that hate thee erewhile have used, --<BR>
thousands then of thanes I shall bring,<BR>
heroes to help thee. Of Hygelac I know,<BR>
ward of his folk, that, though few his years,<BR>
the lord of the Geats will give me aid<BR>
by word and by work, that well I may serve thee,<BR>
wielding the war-wood to win thy triumph<BR>
and lending thee might when thou lackest men.<BR>
If thy Hrethric should come to court of Geats,<BR>
a sovran's son, he will surely there<BR>
find his friends. A far-off land<BR>
each man should visit who vaunts him brave."<BR>
Him then answering, Hrothgar spake:--<BR>
"These words of thine the wisest God<BR>
sent to thy soul! No sager counsel<BR>
from so young in years e'er yet have I heard.<BR>
Thou art strong of main and in mind art wary,<BR>
art wise in words! I ween indeed<BR>
if ever it hap that Hrethel's heir<BR>
by spear be seized, by sword-grim battle,<BR>
by illness or iron, thine elder and lord,<BR>
people's leader, -- and life be thine, --<BR>
no seemlier man will the Sea-Geats find<BR>
at all to choose for their chief and king,<BR>
for hoard-guard of heroes, if hold thou wilt<BR>
thy kinsman's kingdom! Thy keen mind pleases me<BR>
the longer the better, Beowulf loved!<BR>
Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples,<BR>
sons of the Geat and Spear-Dane folk,<BR>
shall have mutual peace, and from murderous strife,<BR>
such as once they waged, from war refrain.<BR>
Long as I rule this realm so wide,<BR>
let our hoards be common, let heroes with gold<BR>
each other greet o'er the gannet's-bath,<BR>
and the ringed-prow bear o'er rolling waves<BR>
tokens of love. I trow my landfolk<BR>
towards friend and foe are firmly joined,<BR>
and honor they keep in the olden way."<BR>
To him in the hall, then, Healfdene's son<BR>
gave treasures twelve, and the trust-of-earls<BR>
bade him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved,<BR>
hale to his home, and in haste return.<BR>
Then kissed the king of kin renowned,<BR>
Scyldings' chieftain, that choicest thane,<BR>
and fell on his neck. Fast flowed the tears<BR>
of the hoary-headed. Heavy with winters,<BR>
he had chances twain, but he clung to this,[1] --<BR>
that each should look on the other again,<BR>
and hear him in hall. Was this hero so dear to him.<BR>
his breast's wild billows he banned in vain;<BR>
safe in his soul a secret longing,<BR>
locked in his mind, for that loved man<BR>
burned in his blood. Then Beowulf strode,<BR>
glad of his gold-gifts, the grass-plot o'er,<BR>
warrior blithe. The wave-roamer bode<BR>
riding at anchor, its owner awaiting.<BR>
As they hastened onward, Hrothgar's gift<BR>
they lauded at length. -- 'Twas a lord unpeered,<BR>
every way blameless, till age had broken<BR>
-- it spareth no mortal -- his splendid might.<BR>

[1] That is, he might or might not see Beowulf again. Old as he was, the
latter chance was likely; but he clung to the former, hoping to see his
young friend again "and exchange brave words in the hall."
