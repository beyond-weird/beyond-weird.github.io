<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE</H1>

LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings<BR>
of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped,<BR>
we have heard, and what honor the athelings won!<BR>
Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes,<BR>
from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore,<BR>
awing the earls. Since erst he lay<BR>
friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him:<BR>
for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve,<BR>
till before him the folk, both far and near,<BR>
who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,<BR>
gave him gifts: a good king he!<BR>
To him an heir was afterward born,<BR>
a son in his halls, whom heaven sent<BR>
to favor the folk, feeling their woe<BR>
that erst they had lacked an earl for leader<BR>
so long a while; the Lord endowed him,<BR>
the Wielder of Wonder, with world's renown.<BR>
Famed was this Beowulf:[1] far flew the boast of him,<BR>
son of Scyld, in the Scandian lands.<BR>
So becomes it a youth to quit him well<BR>
with his father's friends, by fee and gift,<BR>
that to aid him, aged, in after days,<BR>
come warriors willing, should war draw nigh,<BR>
liegemen loyal: by lauded deeds<BR>
shall an earl have honor in every clan.<BR>
Forth he fared at the fated moment,<BR>
sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God.<BR>
Then they bore him over to ocean's billow,<BR>
loving clansmen, as late he charged them,<BR>
while wielded words the winsome Scyld,<BR>
the leader beloved who long had ruled....<BR>
In the roadstead rocked a ring-dight vessel,<BR>
ice-flecked, outbound, atheling's barge:<BR>
there laid they down their darling lord<BR>
on the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings,[2]<BR>
by the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure<BR>
fetched from far was freighted with him.<BR>
No ship have I known so nobly dight<BR>
with weapons of war and weeds of battle,<BR>
with breastplate and blade: on his bosom lay<BR>
a heaped hoard that hence should go<BR>
far o'er the flood with him floating away.<BR>
No less these loaded the lordly gifts,<BR>
thanes' huge treasure, than those had done<BR>
who in former time forth had sent him<BR>
sole on the seas, a suckling child.<BR>
High o'er his head they hoist the standard,<BR>
a gold-wove banner; let billows take him,<BR>
gave him to ocean. Grave were their spirits,<BR>
mournful their mood. No man is able<BR>
to say in sooth, no son of the halls,<BR>
no hero 'neath heaven, -- who harbored that freight!<BR>
<HR WIDTH="50%">
[1] Not, of course, Beowulf the Great, hero of the epic.<BR>
[2] Kenning for king or chieftain of a comitatus: he breaks off gold from
the spiral rings -- often worn on the arm -- and so rewards his followers.
