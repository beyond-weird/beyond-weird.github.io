<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">VAFTHRUTHNISMOL</H1>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">The Ballad of Vafthruthnir</H3>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</H2>
<P>The Vafthruthnismol follows the Hovamol in the <I>Codex Regius</I>. From stanza 20 on it is also included in the <I>Arnamagn&aelig;an Codex</I>, the first part evidently having appeared on leaf now lost. Snorri quotes eight stanzas of it in the <I>Prose Edda</I>, and in his prose text closely paraphrases many others.</P>
<P>The poem is wholly in dialogue form except for a single narrative stanza (stanza 5). After a brief introductory discussion between Othin and his wife, Frigg, concerning the reputed wisdom of the giant Vafthruthnir, Othin, always in quest of wisdom, seeks out the giant, calling himself Gagnrath. The giant immediately insists that they shall demonstrate which is the wiser of the two, and propounds four questions (stanzas 11, 13, 15, and 17), each of which Othin answers. It is then the god's turn to ask, and he begins with a series of twelve numbered questions regarding the origins and past history of life. These Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin asks five more questions, this time referring to what is to follow the destruction of the gods, the last one asking the name of his own slayer. Again Vafthruthnir answers, and Othin finally propounds the unanswerable question: "What spake Othin himself in the ears of his son, ere in the bale-fire he burned?" Vafthruthnir, recognizing his questioner as Othin himself, admits his inferiority in wisdom, and so the contest ends.</P>
<P>The whole poem is essentially encyclop&aelig;dic in character, and thus was particularly useful to Snorri in his preparation of the <I>Prose Edda</I>. The encyclop&aelig;dic poem with a slight narrative outline seems to have been exceedingly popular; the <I>Grimnismol</I> and the much later <I>Alvissmol</I> represent different phases of the same type. The <I>Vafthruthnismol</I> and <I>Grimnismol</I> together, in deed, constitute a fairly complete dictionary of Norse mythology. There has been much discussion as to the probable date of the <I>Vafthruthnismol</I>, but it appears to belong to about the same period as the <I>Voluspo</I>: in other words, the middle of the tenth century. While there may be a few interpolated passages in the poem as we now have it, it is clearly a united whole, and evidently in relatively good condition.</P>

<I><P>Othin spake</I>:<BR>
1, "Counsel me, Frigg, for I long to fare,<BR>
And Vafthruthnir fain would find;<BR>
fit wisdom old with the giant wise<BR>
Myself would I seek to match."</P>
<I><P>Frigg spake:</I><BR>
2. "Heerfather here at home would I keep,<BR>
Where the gods together dwell;<BR>
Amid all the giants an equal in might<BR>
To Vafthruthnir know I none."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
3. "Much have I fared, much have I found.<BR>
Much have I got from the gods;<BR>
And fain would I know how Vafthruthnir now<BR>
Lives in his lofty hall."</P>
<I><P>Frigg spake:</I><BR>
4. "Safe mayst thou go, safe come again,<BR>
And safe be the way thou wendest!<BR>
Father of men, let thy mind be keen<BR>
When speech with the giant thou seekest."</P>

6. "Vafthruthnir, hail! | to thy hall am I come,<BR>
For thyself I fain would see;<BR>
And first would I ask | if wise thou art,<BR>
Or, giant, all wisdom hast won."</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
7. "Who is the man | that speaks to me,<BR>
Here in my lofty hall?<BR>
Forth from our dwelling | thou never shalt fare,<BR>
Unless wiser than I thou art."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
8. "Gagnrath they call me, | and thirsty I come<BR>
From a journey hard to thy hall;<BR>
Welcome I look for, | for long have I fared,<BR>
And gentle greeting, giant."</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>

<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
10. "If a poor man reaches | the home of the rich,<BR>
Let him wisely speak or be still;<BR>
For to him who speaks | with the hard of heart<BR>
Will chattering ever work ill."</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
11. "Speak forth now, Gagnrath, | if there from the floor<BR>
Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known:<BR>
What name has the steed | that each morn anew<BR>
The day for mankind doth draw?"</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
12. "Skinfaxi is he, | the steed who for men<BR>
The glittering day doth draw;<BR>
The best of horses | to heroes he seems,<BR>
And brightly his mane doth burn."</P>

14. "Hrimfaxi name they | the steed that anew<BR>
Brings night for the noble gods;<BR>
Each morning foam | from his bit there falls,<BR>
And thence come the dews in the dales."</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
15. "Speak forth now, Gagnrath, | if there from the floor<BR>
Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known:<BR>
What name has the river | that 'twixt the realms<BR>
Of the gods and the giants goes?"</P>
<I><P>Othin spoke:</I><BR>
16. "Ifing is the river | that 'twixt the realms<BR>
Of the gods and the giants goes;<BR>
For all time ever | open it flows,<BR>
No ice on the river there is."</P>

<P>Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known:<BR>
What name has the field | where in fight shall meet<BR>
Surt and the gracious gods?"</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
18. "Vigrith is the field | where in fight shall meet<BR>
Surt and the gracious gods;<BR>
A hundred miles | each way does it measure.<BR>
And so are its boundaries set."</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
19. "Wise art thou, guest! | To my bench shalt thou go,<BR>
In our seats let us speak together;<BR>
Here in the hall | our heads, O guest,<BR>
Shall we wager our wisdom upon."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
20. "First answer me well, | if thy wisdom avails,<BR>
And thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:<BR>
In earliest time | whence came the earth,<BR>
Or the sky, thou giant sage?"</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[17. <I>Surt</I>: the ruler of the fire-world (Muspellsheim), who comes to attack the gods in the last battle; cf. Voluspo, 52.</P>
<P>18. <I>Vigrith</I>: "the Field of Battle." Snorri quotes this stanza. A hundred miles: a general phrase for a vast distance.</P>
<P>19. With this stanza Vafthruthnir, sufficiently impressed with his guest's wisdom to invite him to share his own seat, resigns the questioning to Othin.</P>
<P>20. The fragmentary version of this poem in the <I>Arnamagn&aelig;an Codex</I> begins in the middle of the first line of this stanza.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 74}</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
21. "Out of Ymir's flesh | was fashioned the earth,<BR>
And the mountains were made of his bones;<BR>
The sky from the frost-cold | giant's skull,<BR>
And the ocean out of his blood."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
22. "Next answer me well, | if thy wisdom avails,<BR>
And thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:<BR>
Whence came the moon, | o'er the world of men<BR>
That fares, and the flaming sun?"</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
23. "Mundilferi is he | who begat the moon,<BR>
And fathered the flaming sun;<BR>
The round of heaven | each day they run,<BR>
To tell the time for men."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
24. "Third answer me well, | if wise thou art called,<BR>
If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:<BR>
Whence came the day, | o'er mankind that fares,<BR>
Or night with the narrowing moon?"</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[21. Ymir: the giant out of whose body the gods made the world; cf. Voluspo, 3 and note.</P>
<P>22. In this and in Othin's following questions, both manuscripts replace the words "next," "third," "fourth," etc., by Roman numerals.</P>
<P>23. <I>Mundilferi</I> ("the Turner"?): known only as the father of Mani (the Moon) and Sol (the Sun). Note that, curiously {footnote p. 75} enough, Mani is the boy and Sol the girl. According to Snorri, Sol drove the horses of the sun, and Mani those of the moon, for the gods, indignant that they should have been given such imposing names, took them from their father to perform these tasks. Cf. <I>Grimnismol</I>, 37.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 75}</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
25. "The father of day | is Delling called,<BR>
And the night was begotten by Nor;<BR>
Full moon and old | by the gods were fashioned,<BR>
To tell the time for men."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
26. "Fourth answer me well, | if wise thou art called,<BR>
If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:<BR>
Whence did winter come, | or the summer warm,<BR>
First with the gracious gods?"</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
27. "Vindsval he was | who was winter's father,<BR>
And Svosuth summer begat;"<BR>
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[25. <I>Delling</I> ("the Dayspring"? Probably another form of the name, Dogling, meaning "Son of the Dew" is more correct): the husband of Not (Night); their son was Dag (Day); cf. Hovamol, 161. Nor: Snorri calls the father of Night Norvi or Narfi, and puts him among the giants. Lines 3-4: cf. Voluspo, 6.</P>
<P>27. Neither the <I>Regius</I> nor the <I>Arnamagn&aelig;an Codex</I> indicates a lacuna. Most editors have filled out the stanza with two lines from late paper manuscripts: "And both of these shall ever be, / Till the gods to destruction go." Bugge ingeniously paraphrases Snorri's prose: "Vindsval's father was Vosuth called, / And rough is all his race." <I>Vindsval</I>: "the Wind-Cold," also called Vindljoni, "the Wind-Man." <I>Svosuth</I>: "the Gentle."]</P>

<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
28. "Fifth answer me well, | if wise thou art called,<BR>
If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:<BR>
What giant first | was fashioned of old,<BR>
And the eldest of Ymir's kin?"</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
29. "Winters unmeasured | ere earth was made<BR>
Was the birth of Bergelmir;<BR>
Thruthgelmir's son | was the giant strong,<BR>
And Aurgelmir's grandson of old."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
30. "Sixth answer me well, | if wise thou art called,<BR>
If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:<BR>
Whence did Aurgelmir come | with the giants' kin,<BR>
Long since, thou giant sage?"</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
31. "Down from Elivagar | did venom drop,<BR>
And waxed till a giant it was;</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[28. <I>Ymir's kin</I>: the giants.</P>
<P>29. <I>Bergelmir</I>: when the gods slew Ymir in order to make the world out of his body, so much blood flowed from him that all the frost-giants were drowned except Bergelmir and his wife, who escaped in a boat; cf. stanza 35. Of <I>Thruthgelmir</I> ("the Mightily Burning") we know nothing, but Aurgelmir was the frost-giants' name for Ymir himself. Thus Ymir was the first of the giants, and so Othin's question is answered.</P>
<P>31. Snorri quotes {illegible}is stanza, and the last two lines are taken from his version, as both of the manuscripts omit them. <I>Elivagar</I> ("Stormy Waves"): Mogk suggests that this river may have been the Milky Way. At any rate, the venom carried in its waters {footnote p. 77} froze into ice-banks over Ginnunga-gap (the "yawning gap" referred to in <I>Voluspo</I>, 3), and then dripped down to make the giant Ymir.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 77}</P>
<P>And thence arose | our giants' race,<BR>
And thus so fierce are we found."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
32. "Seventh answer me well, | if wise thou art called,<BR>
If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:<BR>
How begat he children, | the giant grim,<BR>
Who never a giantess knew?"</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
33. "They say 'neath the arms | of the giant of ice<BR>
Grew man-child and maid together;<BR>
And foot with foot | did the wise one fashion<BR>
A son that six heads bore."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
34. "Eighth answer me well, | if wise thou art called,<BR>
If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:<BR>
What farthest back | dost thou bear in mind?<BR>
For wide is thy wisdom, giant!"</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[33. Snorri gives, without materially elaborating on it, the same account of how Ymir's son and daughter were born under his left arm, and how his feet together created a son. That this offspring should have had six heads is nothing out of the ordinary, for various giants had more than the normal number, and Ymir's mother is credited with a little matter of nine hundred heads; cf. <I>Hymiskvitha</I>, 8. Of the career of Ymir's six headed son we know nothing; he may have been the Thruthgelmir of stanza 29.]</P>

<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
35. "Winters unmeasured | ere earth was made<BR>

In a boat of old was borne."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
36. "Ninth answer me well, | if wise thou art called<BR>
If thou knowest it, Vafthruthnir, now:<BR>
Whence comes the wind | that fares o'er the waves<BR>
Yet never itself is seen?"</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
37. "In an eagle's guise | at the end of heaven<BR>
Hr&aelig;svelg sits, they say;<BR>
And from his wings | does the wind come forth<BR>
To move o'er the world of men."</P>
<I><P>Othin spake:</I><BR>
38. "Tenth answer me now, | if thou knowest all<BR>
The fate that is fixed for the gods:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[35. Snorri quotes this stanza. <I>Bergelmir</I>: on him and his boat cf. stanza 29 and note.</P>
<P>37. Snorri quotes this stanza. <I>Hr&aelig;svelg</I> ("the Corpse-Eater") on this giant in eagle's form cf. Voluspo, So, and Skirnismol, 27.</P>
<P>38. With this stanza the question-formula changes, and Othin's questions from this point on concern more or less directly the great final struggle. Line 4 is presumably spurious. <I>Njorth</I>: on Njorth and the Wanes, who gave him as a hostage to the gods at the end of their war, cf. <I>Voluspo</I>, 21 and note.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 79}</P>
<P>Whence came up Njorth | to the kin of the gods,--<BR>
(Rich in temples | and shrines he rules,--)<BR>
Though of gods he was never begot?"</P>
<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
39. "In the home of the Wanes | did the wise ones create him,<BR>
And gave him as pledge to the gods;<BR>
At the fall of the world | shall he fare once more<BR>
Home to the Wanes so wise."</P>

41. "The heroes all | in Othin's hall<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>[40. In both manuscripts, apparently through the carelessness of some older copyist, stanzas 40 and 41 are run together: "Eleventh answer me well, what men in the home mightily battle each day? They fell each other, and fare from the fight all healed full soon to sit." Luckily Snorri quotes stanza 41 in full, and the translation is from his version. Stanza 40 should probably run something like this: "Eleventh answer me well, if thou knowest all / The fate that is fixed for the gods: / What men are they who in Othin's home / Each day to fight go forth?"</P>
<P>41. <I>The heroes</I>: those brought to Valhall by the Valkyries. After the day's fighting they are healed of their wounds and all feast together.]</P>

<P>45. Snorri quotes this stanza. Hoddmimir's wood: probably {footnote p. 81} this is the ash-tree Yggdrasil, which is sometimes referred to as "Mimir's Tree," because Mimir waters it from his well; cf. <I>Voluspo</I>, 27 and note, and <I>Svipdagsmol</I>, 30 and note. <I>Hoddmimir</I> is presumably another name for Mimir. <I>Lif</I> ("Life") and <I>Lifthrasir</I> ("Sturdy of Life"?): nothing further is known of this pair, from whom the new race of men is to spring.]</P>

<I><P>Vafthruthnir spake:</I><BR>
55. "No man can tell | what in olden time<BR>
Thou spak'st in the ears of thy son;<BR>
With fated mouth | the fall of the gods<BR>
And mine olden tales have I told;<BR>
With Othin in knowledge | now have I striven,<BR>
And ever the wiser thou art."</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[53. <I>The wolf</I>: Fenrir; cf. <I>Voluspo</I>, 53 and 54.</P>
<P>54. <I>His son</I>: Baldr. Bugge changes lines 3-4 to run: "What did Othin speak | in the ear of Baldr, / When to the bale-fire they bore him?" For Baldr's death cf. <I>Voluspo</I>, 3a and note. The question is, of course, unanswerable save by Othin himself, and so the giant at last recognizes his guest.</P>
<P>55. <I>Fated</I>: in stanza 19 Vafthruthnir was rash enough to wager his head against his guest's on the outcome of the contest of wisdom, so he knows that his defeat means his death.]</P>
