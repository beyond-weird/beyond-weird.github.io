<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">KULLERWOINEN SON OF EVIL.</H1>
<P>IN the ancient times a mother<BR>
Hatched and raised some swans and chickens,<BR>
Placed the chickens in the brushwood,<BR>
Placed her swans upon the river;<BR>
Came an eagle, hawk, and falcon,<BR>
Scattered all her swans and chickens,<BR>
One was carried to Karyala,<BR>
And a second into Ehstland,<BR>
Left a third at home in Pohya.<BR>
And the one to Ehstland taken<BR>
Soon became a thriving merchant;<BR>
He that journeyed to Karyala<BR>
Flourished and was called Kalervo;<BR>
He that hid away in Pohya<BR>
Took the name of Untamoinen,<BR>
Flourished to his father's sorrow,<BR>
To the heart-pain of his mother.</P>
<P>Untamoinen sets his fish-nets<BR>
In the waters of Kalervo;<BR>
Kullerwoinen sees the fish-nets,<BR>
Takes the fish home in his basket.<BR>
Then Untamo, evil-minded,<BR>
Angry grew and sighed for vengeance,<BR>
Clutched his fingers for the combat,<BR>
Bared his mighty arms for battle,<BR>
For the stealing of his salmon,<BR>
For the robbing of his fish-nets.<BR>
Long they battled, fierce the struggle,<BR>
Neither one could prove the victor;<BR>
Should one beat the other fiercely,<BR>
He himself was fiercely beaten.</P>
<P>Then arose a second trouble;<BR>
On the second and the third days,<BR>
Kalerwoinen sowed some barley<BR>
Near the barns of Untamoinen;<BR>
Untamoinen's sheep in hunger<BR>
Ate the crop of Kullerwoinen;<BR>
Kullerwoinen's dog in malice<BR>
Tore Untamo's sheep in pieces;<BR>
Then Untamo sorely threatened<BR>
To annihilate the people<BR>
Of his brother, Kalerwoinen,<BR>
To exterminate his tribe-folk,<BR>
To destroy the young and aged,<BR>
To out-root his race and kingdom;<BR>
Conjures men with broadswords girded,<BR>
For the war he fashions heroes,<BR>
Fashions youth with spears adjusted,<BR>
Bearing axes on their shoulders ,<BR>
Conjures thus a mighty army,<BR>
Hastens to begin a battle,<BR>
Bring a war upon his brother.</P>
<P>Kalerwoinen's wife in beauty<BR>
Sat beside her chamber-window,<BR>
Looking out along the highway,<BR>
Spake these words in wonder guessing:<BR>
"Do I see some smoke arising,<BR>
Or perchance a heavy storm-cloud,<BR>
Near the border of the forest,<BR>
Near the ending of the prairie?"</P>
<P>It was not some smoke arising,<BR>
Nor indeed a heavy storm-cloud,<BR>
It was Untamoinen's soldiers<BR>
Marching to the place of battle.<BR>
Warriors of Untamoinen<BR>
Came equipped with spears and arrows,<BR>
Killed the people of Kalervo,<BR>
Slew his tribe and all his kindred,<BR>
Burned to ashes many dwellings,<BR>
Levelled many courts and cabins,<BR>
Only, left Kalervo's daughter,<BR>
With her unborn child, survivors<BR>
Of the slaughter of Untamo;<BR>
And she led the hostile army<BR>
To her father's halls and mansion,<BR>
Swept the rooms and made them cheery,<BR>
Gave the heroes home-attentions.</P>
<P>Time had gone but little distance,<BR>
Ere a boy was born in magic<BR>
Of the virgin, Untamala,<BR>
Of a mother, trouble-laden,<BR>
Him the mother named Kullervo,<BR>
"Pearl of Combat," said Untamo.<BR>
Then they laid the child of wonder,<BR>
Fatherless, the magic infant,<BR>
In the cradle of attention,<BR>
To be rocked, and fed, and guarded;<BR>
But he rocked himself at pleasure,<BR>
Rocked until his locks stood endwise;<BR>
Rocked one day, and then a second,<BR>
Rocked the third from morn till noontide;<BR>
But before the third day ended,<BR>
Kicks the boy with might of magic,<BR>
Forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards,<BR>
Kicks in miracles of power,<BR>
Bursts with might his swaddling garments<BR>
Creeping from beneath his blankets,<BR>
Knocks his cradle into fragments,<BR>
Tears to tatters all his raiment,<BR>
Seemed that he would grow a hero,<BR>
And his mother, Untamala,<BR>
Thought that be, when full of stature,<BR>
When he found his strength and reason,<BR>
Would become a great magician,<BR>
First among a thousand heroes.</P>
<P>When. three months the boy had thriven,<BR>
He began to speak as follows:<BR>
"When my form is full of stature,<BR>
When these arms grow strong and hardy,<BR>
Then will I avenge the murder<BR>
Of Kalervo and his people!"</P>
<P>Untamoinen bears the saying,<BR>
Speaks these words to those about him;<BR>
"To my tribe he brings destruction,<BR>
In him grows a new Kalervo!"</P>
<P>Then the heroes well considered,<BR>
And the women gave their counsel,<BR>
How to kill the magic infant,<BR>
That their tribe may live in safety.<BR>
It appeared the boy would prosper;<BR>
Finally, they all consenting,<BR>
He was placed within a basket,<BR>
And with willows firmly fastened,<BR>
Taken to the reeds and rushes,<BR>
Lowered to the deepest waters,<BR>
In his basket there to perish.</P>
<P>When three nights had circled over,<BR>
Messengers of Untamoinen<BR>
Went to see if be had perished<BR>
In his basket in the waters;<BR>
But the prodigy, was living,<BR>
Had not perished in the rushes;<BR>
He had left his willow-basket,<BR>
Sat in triumph on a billow,<BR>
In his hand a rod of copper,<BR>
On the rod a golden fish-line,<BR>
Fishing for the silver whiting,<BR>
Measuring the deeps beneath him;<BR>
In the sea was little water,<BR>
Scarcely would it fill three measures.</P>
<P>Untamoinen then reflected,<BR>
This the language of the wizard:<BR>
"Whither shall we take this wonder,<BR>
Lay this prodigy of evil,<BR>
That destruction may o'ertake him,<BR>
Where the boy will sink and perish?"</P>
<P>Then his messengers he ordered<BR>
To collect dried poles of brushwood,<BR>
Birch-trees with their hundred branches,<BR>
Pine-trees full of pitch and resin,<BR>
Ordered that a pyre be builded,<BR>
That the boy might be cremated,<BR>
That Kullervo thus might perish.<BR>
High they piled the and branches,<BR>
Dried limbs from the sacred birch-tree,<BR>
Branches from a hundred fir-trees,<BR>
Knots and branches full of resign;<BR>
Filled with bark a thousand sledges,<BR>
Seasoned oak, a hundred measures;<BR>
Piled the brushwood to the tree-tops,<BR>
Set the boy upon the summit,<BR>
Set on fire the pile of brushwood,<BR>
Burned one day, and then a second,<BR>
Burned the third from morn till evening.</P>
<P>When Untamo sent his heralds<BR>
To inspect the pyre and wizard,<BR>
There to learn if young Kullervo<BR>
Had been burned to dust and ashes,<BR>
There they saw the young boy sitting<BR>
On a pyramid of embers,<BR>
In his band a rod of copper,<BR>
Raking coals of fire about him,<BR>
To increase their heat and power;<BR>
Not a hair was burned nor injured,<BR>
Not a ringlet singed nor shrivelled.</P>
<P>Then Untamo, evil-humored,<BR>
Thus addressed his trusted heralds:<BR>
"Whither shall the boy be taken,<BR>
To what place this thing of evil,<BR>
That destruction may o'ertake him.<BR>
That the boy may sink and perish?"</P>
<P>Then they hung him to an oak-tree,<BR>
Crucified him in the branches,<BR>
That the wizard there might perish.</P>
<P>When three days and nights had ended,<BR>
Untamoinen spake as follows:<BR>
"It is time to send my heralds<BR>
To inspect the mighty oak-tree,<BR>
There to learn if young Kullervo<BR>
Lives or dies among the branches."</P>
<P>Thereupon he sent his servants,<BR>
And the heralds brought this message:<BR>
"Young Kullervo has not perished,<BR>
Has not died among the branches<BR>
Of the oak-tree where we hung him.<BR>
In the oak he maketh pictures<BR>
With a wand between his fingers;<BR>
Pictures hang from all the branches,<BR>
Carved and painted by Kullervo;<BR>
And the heroes, thick as acorns,<BR>
With their swords and spears adjuste4<BR>
Fill the branches of the oak-tree,<BR>
Every leaf becomes a soldier."</P>
<P>Who can help the grave Untamo<BR>
Kill the boy that threatens evil<BR>
To Untamo's tribe and country,<BR>
Since he will not die by water,<BR>
Nor by fire, nor crucifixion?<BR>
Finally it was decided<BR>
That his body was immortal,<BR>
Could not suffer death nor torture.</P>
<P>In despair grave Untamoinen<BR>
Thus addressed the boy, Kullervo:<BR>
"Wilt thou live a life becoming,<BR>
Always do my people honor,<BR>
Should I keep thee in my dwelling?<BR>
Shouldst thou render servant's duty,<BR>
Then thou wilt receive thy wages,<BR>
Reaping whatsoe'er thou sowest;<BR>
Thou canst wear the golden girdle,<BR>
Or endure the tongue of censure."</P>
<P>When the boy had grown a little,<BR>
Had increased in strength and stature,<BR>
He was given occupation,<BR>
He was made to tend an infant,<BR>
Made to rock the infant's cradle.<BR>
These the words of Untamoinen:<BR>
"Often look upon the young child,<BR>
Feed him well and guard from danger,<BR>
Wash his linen in the river,<BR>
Give the infant good attention."</P>
<P>Young Kullervo, wicked wizard,<BR>
Nurses one day then a second;<BR>
On the morning of the third day,<BR>
Gives the infant cruel treatment,<BR>
Blinds its eyes and breaks its fingers;<BR>
And when evening shadows gather,<BR>
Kills the young child while it slumbers,<BR>
Throws its body to the waters,<BR>
Breaks and burns the infant's cradle.<BR>
Untamoinen thus reflected:<BR>
"Never will this fell Kullervo<BR>
Be a worthy nurse for children,<BR>
Cannot rock a babe in safety;<BR>
Do not know how I can use him,<BR>
What employment I can give him!"<BR>
Then he told the young magician<BR>
He must fell the standing forest,<BR>
And Kullervo gave this answer:<BR>
"Only will I be a hero,<BR>
When I wield the magic hatchet;<BR>
I am young, and fair, and mighty,<BR>
Far more beautiful than others,<BR>
Have the skill of six magicians."</P>
<P>Thereupon he sought the blacksmith,<BR>
This the order of Kullervo:<BR>
"Listen, O thou metal-artist,<BR>
Forge for me an axe of copper,<BR>
Forge the mighty axe of heroes,<BR>
Wherewith I may fell the forest,<BR>
Fell the birch, and oak, and aspen."</P>
<P>This behest the blacksmith honors,<BR>
Forges him an axe of copper,<BR>
Wonderful the blade he forges.<BR>
Kullerwoinen grinds his hatchet,<BR>
Grinds his blade from morn till evening,<BR>
And the next day makes the handle;<BR>
Then he hastens to the forest,<BR>
To the upward-sloping mountain,<BR>
To the tallest of the birches,<BR>
To the mightiest of oak-trees;<BR>
There he swings his axe of copper,<BR>
Swings his blade with might of magic,<BR>
Cuts with sharpened edge the aspen,<BR>
With one blow he fells the oak-tree,<BR>
With a second blow, the linden;<BR>
Many trees have quickly fallen,<BR>
By the hatchet of Kullervo.<BR>
Then the wizard spake as follows:<BR>
"This the proper work of Lempo,<BR>
Let dire Hisi fell the forest!"</P>
<P>In the birch he sank his hatchet,<BR>
Made an uproar in the woodlands,<BR>
Called aloud in tones, of thunder,<BR>
Whistled to the distant mountains,<BR>
Till they echoed to his calling,<BR>
When Kullervo spake as follows:<BR>
"May the forest, in the circle<BR>
Where my voice rings, fall and perish,<BR>
In the earth be lost forever!<BR>
May no tree remain unlevelled,<BR>
May no saplings grow in spring-time,<BR>
Never while the moonlight glimmers,<BR>
Where Kullervo's voice has echoed,<BR>
Where the forest hears my calling;<BR>
Where the ground with seed is planted,<BR>
And the grain shall sprout and flourish,<BR>
May it never come to ripeness,<BR>
Mar the ears of corn be blasted!"</P>
<P>When the strong man, Untamoinen,<BR>
Went to look at early evening,<BR>
How Kullervo was progressing,<BR>
In his labors in the forest;<BR>
Little was the work accomplished,<BR>
Was not worthy of a here;<BR>
Untamoinen thus reflected:<BR>
"Young Kullervo is not fitted<BR>
For the work of clearing forests,<BR>
Wastes the best of all the timber,<BR>
To my lands he brings destruction;<BR>
I shall set him making fences."</P>
<P>Then the youth began the building<BR>
Of a fence for Untamoinen;<BR>
Took the trunks of stately fir-trees,<BR>
Trimmed them with his blade for fence-posts,<BR>
Cut the tallest in the woodlands,<BR>
For the railing of his fences;<BR>
Made the smaller poles and cross-bars<BR>
From the longest of the lindens;<BR>
Made the fence without a pass-way,<BR>
Made no wicket in his fences,<BR>
And Kullervo spake these measures.<BR>
"He that does not rise as eagles,<BR>
Does not sail on wings through ether,<BR>
Cannot cross Kullervo's pickets,<BR>
Nor the fences he has builded."</P>
<P>Untamoinen left his mansion<BR>
To inspect the young boy's labors,<BR>
View the fences of Kullervo;<BR>
Saw the fence without a pass-way,<BR>
Not a wicket in his fences;<BR>
From the earth the fence extended<BR>
To the highest clouds of heaven.<BR>
These the words of Untamoinen:<BR>
"For this work be is not fitted,<BR>
Useless is the fence thus builded;<BR>
Is so high that none can cross it,<BR>
And there is no passage through it:<BR>
He shall thresh the rye and barley."</P>
<P>Young Kullervo, quick preparing<BR>
Made an oaken flail for threshing,<BR>
Threshed the rye to finest powder,<BR>
Threshed the barley into atoms,<BR>
And the straw to worthless fragments.</P>
<P>Untamoinen went at evening,<BR>
Went to see Kullervo's threshing,<BR>
View the work of Kullerwoinen;<BR>
Found the rye was ground to powder,<BR>
Grains of barley crushed to atoms,<BR>
And the straw to worthless rubbish.</P>
<P>Untamoinen then grew angry,<BR>
Spake these words in bitter accents:<BR>
"Kullerwoinen as a workman<BR>
Is a miserable failure;<BR>
Whatsoever work he touches<BR>
Is but ruined by his witchcraft;<BR>
I shall carry him to Ehstland,<BR>
In Karyala I shall sell him<BR>
To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
There to swing the heavy hammer."</P>
<P>Untamoinen sells Kullervo,<BR>
Trades him off in far Karyala,<BR>
To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
To the master of the metals,<BR>
This the sum received in payment:<BR>
Seven worn and worthless sickles,<BR>
Three old caldrons worse than useless,<BR>
Three old scythes, and hoes, and axes,<BR>
Recompense, indeed, sufficient<BR>
For a boy that will not labor<BR>
For the good of his employer.</P>
