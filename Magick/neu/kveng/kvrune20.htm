<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE BREWING OF BEER.</H1>
<P>Now we sing the wondrous legends,<BR>
Songs of wedding-feasts and dances,<BR>
Sing the melodies of wedlock,<BR>
Sing the songs of old tradition;<BR>
Sing of Ilmarinen's marriage<BR>
To the Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Fairest daughter of the Northland,<BR>
Sing the drinking-songs of Pohya.</P>
<P>Long prepared they for the wedding<BR>
In Pohyola's halls and chambers,<BR>
In the courts of Sariola;<BR>
Many things that Louhi ordered,<BR>
Great indeed the preparations<BR>
For the marriage of the daughter,<BR>
For the feasting of the heroes,<BR>
For the drinking of the strangers,<BR>
For the feeding of the poor-folk,<BR>
For the people's entertainment.</P>
<P>Grew an ox in far Karjala,<BR>
Not the largest, nor the smallest,<BR>
Was the ox that grew in Suomi;<BR>
But his size was all-sufficient,<BR>
For his tail was sweeping Jamen,<BR>
And his head was over Kemi,<BR>
Horns in length a hundred fathoms,<BR>
Longer than the horns his mouth was;<BR>
Seven days it took a weasel<BR>
To encircle neck and shoulders;<BR>
One whole day a swallow journeyed<BR>
From one horn-tip to the other,<BR>
Did not stop between for resting.<BR>
Thirty days the squirrel travelled<BR>
From the tail to reach the shoulders,<BR>
But he could not gain the horn-tip<BR>
Till the Moon had long passed over.</P>
<P>This young ox of huge dimensions,<BR>
This great calf of distant Suomi,<BR>
Was conducted from Karjala<BR>
To the meadows of Pohyola;<BR>
At each horn a hundred heroes,<BR>
At his head and neck a thousand.<BR>
When the mighty ox was lassoed,<BR>
Led away to Northland pastures,<BR>
Peacefully the monster journeyed<BR>
By the bays of Sariola,<BR>
Ate the pasture on the borders;<BR>
To the clouds arose his shoulders,<BR>
And his horns to highest heaven.<BR>
Not in all of Sariola<BR>
Could a butcher be discovered<BR>
That could kill the ox for Louhi,<BR>
None of all the sons of Northland,<BR>
In her hosts of giant people,<BR>
In her rising generation,<BR>
In the hosts of those grown older.</P>
<P>Came a hero from a distance,<BR>
Wirokannas from Karelen,<BR>
And these words the gray-beard uttered:<BR>
"Wait, O wait, thou ox of Suomi,<BR>
Till I bring my ancient war-club;<BR>
Then I'll smite thee on thy forehead,<BR>
Break thy skull, thou willing victim!<BR>
Nevermore wilt thou in summer<BR>
Browse the woods of Sariola,<BR>
Bare our pastures, fields, and forests;<BR>
Thou, O ox, wilt feed no longer<BR>
Through the length and breadth of Northland,<BR>
On the borders of this ocean!"</P>
<P>When the ancient Wirokannas<BR>
Started out the ox to slaughter,<BR>
When Palwoinen swung his war-club,<BR>
Quick the victim turned his forehead,<BR>
Flashed his flaming eyes upon him;<BR>
To the fir-tree leaped the hero,<BR>
In the thicket hid Palwoinen,<BR>
Hid the gray-haired Wirokannas.</P>
<P>Everywhere they seek a butcher,<BR>
One to kill the ox of Suomi,<BR>
In the country of Karelen,<BR>
And among the Suomi-giants,<BR>
In the quiet fields of Ehstland,<BR>
On the battle-fields of Sweden,<BR>
Mid the mountaineers of Lapland,<BR>
In the magic fens of Turya;<BR>
Seek him in Tuoni's empire,<BR>
In the death-courts of Manala.<BR>
Long the search, and unsuccessful,<BR>
On the blue back of the ocean,<BR>
On the far-outstretching pastures.</P>
<P>There arose from out the sea-waves,<BR>
Rose a hero from the waters,<BR>
On the white-capped, roaring breakers,<BR>
From the water's broad expanses;<BR>
Nor belonged he to the largest,<BR>
Nor belonged he to the smallest;<BR>
Made his bed within a sea-shell,<BR>
Stood erect beneath a flour-sieve,<BR>
Hero old, with hands of iron,<BR>
And his face was copper-colored;<BR>
Quick the hero full unfolded,<BR>
Like the full corn from the kernel.<BR>
On his head a hat of flint-stone,<BR>
On his feet were sandstone-sandals,<BR>
In his hand a golden cleaver,<BR>
And the blade was copper-handled.<BR>
Thus at last they found a butcher,<BR>
Found the magic ox a slayer.<BR>
Nothing has been found so mighty<BR>
That it has not found a master.</P>
<P>As the sea-god saw his booty,<BR>
Quickly rushed he on his victim,<BR>
Hurled him to his knees before him,<BR>
Quickly felled the calf of Suomi,<BR>
Felled the young ox of Karelen.<BR>
Bountifully meat was furnished;<BR>
Filled at least a thousand hogsheads<BR>
Of his blood were seven boatfuls,<BR>
And a thousand weight of suet,<BR>
For the banquet of Pohyola,<BR>
For the marriage-feast of Northland.</P>
<P>In Pohyola was a guest-room,<BR>
Ample was the hall of Louhi,<BR>
Was in length a hundred furlongs,<BR>
And in breadth was nearly fifty;<BR>
When upon the roof a rooster<BR>
Crowed at break of early morning,<BR>
No one on the earth could hear him;<BR>
When the dog barked at one entrance,<BR>
None could hear him at the other.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Hastens to the hall and court-room,<BR>
In the centre speaks as follows:<BR>
"Whence indeed will come the liquor,<BR>
Who will brew me beer from barley,<BR>
Who will make the mead abundant,<BR>
For the people of the Northland,<BR>
Coming to my daughter's marriage,<BR>
To her drinking-feast and nuptials?<BR>
Cannot comprehend the malting,<BR>
Never have I learned the secret,<BR>
Nor the origin of brewing."<BR>
Spake an old man from his corner:<BR>
"Beer arises from the barley,<BR>
Comes from barley, hops, and water,<BR>
And the fire gives no assistance.<BR>
Hop-vine was the son of Remu,<BR>
Small the seed in earth was planted,<BR>
Cultivated in the loose soil,<BR>
Scattered like the evil serpents<BR>
On the brink of Kalew-waters,<BR>
On the Osmo-fields and borders.<BR>
There the young plant grew and flourished,<BR>
There arose the climbing hop-vine,<BR>
Clinging to the rocks and alders.</P>
<P>"Man of good-luck sowed the barley<BR>
On the Osmo hills and lowlands,<BR>
And the barley grew and flourished,<BR>
Grew and spread in rich abundance,<BR>
Fed upon the air and water,<BR>
On the Osmo plains and highlands,<BR>
On the fields of Kalew-heroes.</P>
<P>"Time had travelled little distance,<BR>
Ere the hops in trees were humming,<BR>
Barley in the fields was singing,<BR>
And from Kalew's well the water,<BR>
This the language of the trio:<BR>
'Let us join our triple forces,<BR>
Join to each the other's powers;<BR>
Sad alone to live and struggle,<BR>
Little use in working singly,<BR>
Better we should toil together.'</P>
<P>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<BR>
Brewer of the drink refreshing,<BR>
Takes the golden grains of barley,<BR>
Taking six of barley-kernels,<BR>
Taking seven tips of hop-fruit,<BR>
Filling seven cups with water,<BR>
On the fire she sets the caldron,<BR>
Boils the barley, hops, and water,<BR>
Lets them steep, and seethe, and bubble<BR>
Brewing thus the beer delicious,<BR>
In the hottest days of summer,<BR>
On the foggy promontory,<BR>
On the island forest-covered;<BR>
Poured it into birch-wood barrels,<BR>
Into hogsheads made of oak-wood.</P>
<P>"Thus did Osmotar of Kalew<BR>
Brew together hops and barley,<BR>
Could not generate the ferment.<BR>
Thinking long and long debating,<BR>
Thus she spake in troubled accents:<BR>
'What will bring the effervescence,<BR>
Who will add the needed factor,<BR>
That the beer may foam and sparkle,<BR>
May ferment and be delightful?'</P>
<P>Kalevatar, magic maiden,<BR>
Grace and beauty in her fingers,<BR>
Swiftly moving, lightly stepping,<BR>
In her trimly-buckled sandals,<BR>
Steps upon the birch-wood bottom,<BR>
Turns one way, and then another,<BR>
In the centre of the caldron;<BR>
Finds within a splinter lying<BR>
From the bottom lifts the fragment,<BR>
Turns it in her fingers, musing:<BR>
'What may come of this I know not,<BR>
In the hands of magic maidens,<BR>
In the virgin hands of Kapo,<BR>
Snowy virgin of the Northland!'</P>
<P>"Kalevatar took the splinter<BR>
To the magic virgin, Kapo,<BR>
Who by unknown force and insight.<BR>
Rubbed her hands and knees together,<BR>
And produced a snow-white squirrel;<BR>
Thus instructed she her creature,<BR>
Gave the squirrel these directions:<BR>
'Snow-white squirrel, mountain-jewel,<BR>
Flower of the field and forest,<BR>
Haste thee whither I would send thee,<BR>
Into Metsola's wide limits,<BR>
Into Tapio's seat of wisdom;<BR>
Hasten through the heavy tree-tops,<BR>
Wisely through the thickest branches,<BR>
That the eagle may not seize thee,<BR>
Thus escape the bird of heaven.<BR>
Bring me ripe cones from the fir-tree,<BR>
From the pine-tree bring me seedlings,<BR>
Bring them to the hands of Kapo,<BR>
For the beer of Osmo's daughter.'</P>
<P>Quickly hastened forth the squirrel,<BR>
Quickly sped the nimble broad-tail,<BR>
Swiftly hopping on its journey<BR>
From one thicket to another,<BR>
From the birch-tree to the aspen,<BR>
From the pine-tree to the willow,<BR>
From the sorb-tree to the alder,<BR>
Jumping here and there with method,<BR>
Crossed the eagle-woods in safety,<BR>
Into Metsola's wide limits,<BR>
Into Tapio's seat of wisdom;<BR>
There perceived three magic pine-trees,<BR>
There perceived three smaller fir-trees,<BR>
Quickly climbed the dark-green branches,<BR>
Was not captured by the eagle,<BR>
Was not mangled in his talons;<BR>
Broke the young cones from the fir-tree,<BR>
Cut the shoots of pine-tree branches,<BR>
Hid the cones within his pouches,<BR>
Wrapped them in his fur-grown mittens<BR>
Brought them to the hands of Kapo,<BR>
To the magic virgin's fingers.<BR>
Kapo took the cones selected,<BR>
Laid them in the beer for ferment,<BR>
But it brought no effervescence,<BR>
And the beer was cold and lifeless.</P>
<P>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<BR>
Kapo, brewer of the liquor,<BR>
Deeply thought and long considered:<BR>
'What will bring the effervescence,<BR>
Who will lend me aid efficient,<BR>
That the beer may foam and sparkle,<BR>
May ferment and be refreshing?'</P>
<P>"Kalevatar, sparkling maiden,<BR>
Grace and beauty in her fingers,<BR>
Softly moving, lightly stepping,<BR>
In her trimly-buckled sandals,<BR>
Steps again upon the bottom,<BR>
Turns one way and then another,<BR>
In the centre of the caldron,<BR>
Sees a chip upon the bottom,<BR>
Takes it from its place of resting,<BR>
Looks upon the chip and muses<BR>
'What may come of this I know not,<BR>
In the hands of mystic maidens,<BR>
In the hands of magic Kapo,<BR>
In the virgin's snow-white fingers.'</P>
<P>"Kalevatar took the birch-chip<BR>
To the magic maiden, Kapo,<BR>
Gave it to the white-faced maiden.<BR>
Kapo, by the aid of magic,<BR>
Rubbed her hands and knees together,<BR>
And produced a magic marten,<BR>
And the marten, golden-breasted;<BR>
Thus instructed she her creature,<BR>
Gave the marten these directions.<BR>
'Thou, my golden-breasted marten,<BR>
Thou my son of golden color,<BR>
Haste thou whither I may send thee,<BR>
To the bear-dens of the mountain,<BR>
To the grottoes of the growler,<BR>
Gather yeast upon thy fingers,<BR>
Gather foam from lips of anger,<BR>
From the lips of bears in battle,<BR>
Bring it to the hands of Kapo,<BR>
To the hands of Osmo's daughter.'</P>
<P>"Then the marten golden-breasted,<BR>
Full consenting, hastened onward,<BR>
Quickly bounding on his journey,<BR>
Lightly leaping through the distance<BR>
Leaping o'er the widest rivers,<BR>
Leaping over rocky fissures,<BR>
To the bear-dens of the mountain,<BR>
To the grottoes of the growler,<BR>
Where the wild-bears fight each other,<BR>
Where they pass a dread existence,<BR>
Iron rocks, their softest pillows,<BR>
In the fastnesses of mountains;<BR>
From their lips the foam was dripping,<BR>
From their tongues the froth of anger;<BR>
This the marten deftly gathered,<BR>
Brought it to the maiden, Kapo,<BR>
Laid it in her dainty fingers.</P>
<P>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<BR>
Brewer of the beer of barley,<BR>
Used the beer-foam as a ferment;<BR>
But it brought no effervescence,<BR>
Did not make the liquor sparkle.</P>
<P>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<BR>
Thought again, and long debated:<BR>
'Who or what will bring the ferment,<BR>
Th at my beer may not be lifeless?'</P>
<P>"Kalevatar, magic maiden,<BR>
Grace and beauty in her fingers,<BR>
Softly moving, lightly stepping,<BR>
In her trimly-buckled sandals,<BR>
Steps again upon the bottom,<BR>
Turns one way and then another,<BR>
In the centre of the caldron,<BR>
Sees a pod upon the bottom,<BR>
Lifts it in her snow-white fingers,<BR>
Turns it o'er and o'er, and muses:<BR>
'What may come of this I know not,<BR>
In the hands of magic maidens,<BR>
In the hands of mystic Kapo,<BR>
In the snowy virgin's fingers?'</P>
<P>"Kalevatar, sparkling maiden,<BR>
Gave the pod to magic Kapo;<BR>
Kapo, by the aid of magic,<BR>
Rubbed the pod upon her knee-cap,<BR>
And a honey-bee came flying<BR>
From the pod within her fingers,<BR>
Kapo thus addressed her birdling:<BR>
'Little bee with honeyed winglets,<BR>
King of all the fragrant flowers,<BR>
Fly thou whither I direct thee,<BR>
To the islands in the ocean,<BR>
To the water-cliffs and grottoes,<BR>
Where asleep a maid has fallen,<BR>
Girdled with a belt of copper<BR>
By her side are honey-grasses,<BR>
By her lips are fragrant flowers,<BR>
Herbs and flowers honey-laden;<BR>
Gather there the sweetened juices,<BR>
Gather honey on thy winglets,<BR>
From the calyces of flowers,<BR>
From the tips of seven petals,<BR>
Bring it to the hands of Kapo,<BR>
To the hands of Osmo's daughter.'</P>
<P>"Then the bee, the swift-winged birdling,<BR>
Flew away with lightning-swiftness<BR>
On his journey to the islands,<BR>
O'er the high waves of the ocean;<BR>
Journeyed one day, then a second,<BR>
Journeyed all the next day onward,<BR>
Till the third day evening brought him<BR>
To the islands in the ocean,<BR>
To the water-cliffs and grottoes;<BR>
Found the maiden sweetly sleeping,<BR>
In her silver-tinselled raiment,<BR>
Girdled with a belt of copper,<BR>
In a nameless meadow, sleeping,<BR>
In the honey-fields of magic;<BR>
By her side were honeyed grasses,<BR>
By her lips were fragrant flowers,<BR>
Silver stalks with golden petals;<BR>
Dipped its winglets in the honey,<BR>
Dipped its fingers in the juices<BR>
Of the sweetest of the flowers,<BR>
Brought the honey back to Kapo,<BR>
To the mystic maiden's fingers.</P>
<P>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<BR>
Placed the honey in the liquor;<BR>
Kapo mixed the beer and honey,<BR>
And the wedding-beer fermented;<BR>
Rose the live beer upward, upward,<BR>
From the bottom of the vessels,<BR>
Upward in the tubs of birch-wood,<BR>
Foaming higher, higher, higher,<BR>
Till it touched the oaken handles,<BR>
Overflowing all the caldrons;<BR>
To the ground it foamed and sparkled,<BR>
Sank away in sand and gravel.</P>
<P>"Time had gone but little distance,<BR>
Scarce a moment had passed over,<BR>
Ere the heroes came in numbers<BR>
To the foaming beer of Northland,<BR>
Rushed to drink the sparkling liquor.<BR>
Ere all others Lemminkainen<BR>
Drank, and grew intoxicated<BR>
On the beer of Osmo's daughter,<BR>
On the honey-drink of Kalew.</P>
<P>"Osmotar, the beer-preparer,<BR>
Kapo, brewer of the barley,<BR>
Spake these words in saddened accents:<BR>
'Woe is me, my life hard-fated,<BR>
Badly have I brewed the liquor,<BR>
Have not brewed the beer in wisdom,<BR>
Will not live within its vessels,<BR>
Overflows and fills Pohyola!'</P>
<P>"From a tree-top sings the redbreast,<BR>
From the aspen calls the robin:<BR>
'Do not grieve, thy beer is worthy,<BR>
Put it into oaken vessels,<BR>
Into strong and willing barrels<BR>
Firmly bound with hoops of copper.'</P>
<P>"Thus was brewed the beer or Northland,<BR>
At the hands of Osmo's daughter;<BR>
This the origin of brewing<BR>
Beer from Kalew-hops and barley;<BR>
Great indeed the reputation<BR>
Of the ancient beer of Kalew,<BR>
Said to make the feeble hardy,<BR>
Famed to dry the tears of women,<BR>
Famed to cheer the broken-hearted,<BR>
Make the aged young and supple,<BR>
Make the timid brave and mighty,<BR>
Make the brave men ever braver,<BR>
Fill the heart with joy and gladness,<BR>
Fill the mind with wisdom-sayings,<BR>
Fill the tongue with ancient legends,<BR>
Only makes the fool more foolish."</P>
<P>When the hostess of Pohyola<BR>
Heard how beer was first fermented,<BR>
Heard the origin of brewing,<BR>
Straightway did she fill with water<BR>
Many oaken tubs and barrels;<BR>
Filled but half the largest vessels,<BR>
Mixed the barley with the water,<BR>
Added also hops abundant;<BR>
Well she mixed the triple forces<BR>
In her tubs of oak and birch-wood,<BR>
Heated stones for months succeeding,<BR>
Thus to boil the magic mixture,<BR>
Steeped it through the days of summer,<BR>
Burned the wood of many forests,<BR>
Emptied all the, springs of Pohya;<BR>
Daily did the, forests lesson,<BR>
And the wells gave up their waters,<BR>
Thus to aid the hostess, Louhi,<BR>
In the brewing of the liquors,<BR>
From the water, hops, and barley,<BR>
And from honey of the islands,<BR>
For the wedding-feast of Northland,<BR>
For Pohyola's great carousal<BR>
And rejoicings at the marriage<BR>
Of the Malden of the Rainbow<BR>
To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Metal-worker of Wainola.</P>
<P>Smoke is seen upon the island,<BR>
Fire, upon the promontory,<BR>
Black smoke rising to the heavens<BR>
From the fire upon the island;<BR>
Fills with clouds the half of Pohya,<BR>
Fills Karelen's many hamlets;<BR>
All the people look and wonder,<BR>
This the chorus of the women:<BR>
"Whence are rising all these smoke-clouds,<BR>
Why this dreadful fire in Northland?<BR>
Is not like the smoke of camp-fires,<BR>
Is too large for fires of shepherds!"</P>
<P>Lemminkainen's ancient mother<BR>
Journeyed in the early morning<BR>
For some water to the fountain,<BR>
Saw the smoke arise to heaven,<BR>
In the region of Pohyola,<BR>
These the words the mother uttered:<BR>
"'Tis the smoke of battle-heroes,<BR>
From the beat of warring armies!"</P>
<P>Even Ahti, island-hero,<BR>
Ancient wizard, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Also known as Kaukomieli,<BR>
Looked upon the scene in wonder,<BR>
Thought awhile and spake as follows:<BR>
"I would like to see this nearer,<BR>
Learn the cause of all this trouble,<BR>
Whence this smoke and great confusion,<BR>
Whether smoke from heat of battle,<BR>
Or the bonfires of the shepherds."</P>
<P>Kaukomieli gazed and pondered,<BR>
Studied long the rising smoke-clouds;<BR>
Came not from the heat of battle,<BR>
Came not from the shepherd bonfires;<BR>
Heard they were the fires of Louhi<BR>
Brewing beer in Sariola,<BR>
On Pohyola's promontory;<BR>
Long and oft looked Lemminkainen,<BR>
Strained in eagerness his vision,<BR>
Stared, and peered, and thought, and wondered,<BR>
Looked abashed and envy-swollen,<BR>
"O beloved, second mother,<BR>
Northland's well-intentioned hostess,<BR>
Brew thy beer of honey-flavor,<BR>
Make thy liquors foam and sparkle,<BR>
For thy many friends invited,<BR>
Brew it well for Lemminkainen,<BR>
For his marriage in Pohyola<BR>
With the Maiden of the Rainbow."</P>
<P>Finally the beer was ready,<BR>
Beverage of noble heroes,<BR>
Stored away in casks and barrels,<BR>
There to rest awhile in silence,<BR>
In the cellars of the Northland,<BR>
In the copper-banded vessels,<BR>
In the magic oaken hogsheads,<BR>
Plugs and faucets made of copper.<BR>
Then the hostess of Pohyola<BR>
Skilfully prepared the dishes,<BR>
Laid them all with careful fingers<BR>
In the boiling-pans and kettles,<BR>
Ordered countless loaves of barley,<BR>
Ordered many liquid dishes,<BR>
All the delicacies of Northland,<BR>
For the feasting of her people,<BR>
For their richest entertainment,<BR>
For the nuptial songs and dances,<BR>
At the marriage of her daughter<BR>
With the blacksmith, Ilmarinen.</P>
<P>When the loaves were baked and ready.<BR>
When the dishes all were seasoned,<BR>
Time had gone but little distance,<BR>
Scarce a moment had passed over,<BR>
Ere the beer, in casks imprisoned,<BR>
Loudly rapped, and sang, and murmured:<BR>
"Come, ye heroes, come and take me,<BR>
Come and let me cheer your spirits,<BR>
Make you sing the songs of wisdom,<BR>
That with honor ye may praise me,<BR>
Sing the songs of beer immortal!"</P>
<P>Straightway Louhi sought a minstrel,<BR>
Magic bard and artist-singer,<BR>
That the beer might well be lauded,<BR>
Might be praised in song and honor.<BR>
First as bard they brought a salmon,<BR>
Also brought a pike from ocean,<BR>
But the salmon had no talent,<BR>
And the pike had little wisdom;<BR>
Teeth of pike and gills of salmon<BR>
Were not made for singing legends.</P>
<P>Then again they sought a singer,<BR>
Magic minstrel, beer-enchanter,<BR>
Thus to praise the drink of heroes,<BR>
Sing the songs of joy and gladness;<BR>
And a boy was brought for singing;<BR>
But the boy had little knowledge,<BR>
Could not praise the beer in honor;<BR>
Children's tongues are filled with questions,<BR>
Children cannot speak in wisdom,<BR>
Cannot sing the ancient legends.</P>
<P>Stronger grew the beer imprisoned<BR>
In the copper-banded vessels,<BR>
Locked behind the copper faucets,<BR>
Boiled, and foamed, and sang, and murmured:<BR>
"If ye do not bring a singer,<BR>
That will sing my worth immortal,<BR>
That will sing my praise deserving,<BR>
I will burst these bands of copper,<BR>
Burst the heads of all these barrels;<BR>
Will not serve the best of heroes<BR>
Till he sings my many virtues."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Called a trusted maiden-servant,<BR>
Sent her to invite the people<BR>
To the marriage of her daughter,<BR>
These the words that Louhi uttered:<BR>
"O my trusted, truthful maiden,<BR>
Servant-maid to me belonging,<BR>
Call together all my people,<BR>
Call the heroes to my banquet,<BR>
Ask the rich, and ask the needy,<BR>
Ask the blind and deaf, and crippled,<BR>
Ask the young, and ask the aged;<BR>
Go thou to the hills, and hedges,<BR>
To the highways, and the by-ways,<BR>
Urge them to my daughter's wedding;<BR>
Bring the blind, and sorely troubled,<BR>
In my boats upon the waters,<BR>
In my sledges bring the halting,<BR>
With the old, and sick, and needy;<BR>
Ask the whole of Sariola,<BR>
Ask the people of Karelen,<BR>
Ask the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Famous bard and wisdom-singer;<BR>
But I give command explicit<BR>
Not to ask wild Lemminkainen,<BR>
Not the island-dweller, Ahti!"<BR>
This the question of the servant:<BR>
"Why not ask wild Lemminkainen,<BR>
Ancient islander and minstrel?"</P>
<P>Louhi gave this simple answer:<BR>
"Good the reasons that I give thee<BR>
Why the wizard, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Must not have an invitation<BR>
To my daughter's feast and marriage<BR>
Ahti courts the heat of battle,<BR>
Lemminkainen fosters trouble,<BR>
Skilful fighter of the virtues;<BR>
Evil thinking, acting evil,<BR>
He would bring but pain and sorrow,<BR>
He would jest and jeer at maidens<BR>
In their trimly buckled raiment,<BR>
Cannot ask the evil-minded!"<BR>
Thus again the servant questions:<BR>
"Tell me how to know this Ahti,<BR>
Also known as Lemminkainen,<BR>
That I may not ask him hither;<BR>
Do not know the isle of Ahti,<BR>
Nor the home of Kaukomieli<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Easy 'tis to know the wizard,<BR>
Easy find the Ahti-dwelling:<BR>
Ahti lives on yonder island,<BR>
On that point dwells Lemminkainen,<BR>
In his mansion near the water,<BR>
Far at sea his home and dwelling."</P>
<P>Thereupon the trusted maiden<BR>
Spread the wedding-invitations<BR>
To the people of Pohyola,<BR>
To the tribes of Kalevala;<BR>
Asked the friendless, asked the homeless<BR>
Asked the laborers and shepherds,<BR>
Asked the fishermen and hunters,<BR>
Asked the deaf, the dumb, the crippled,<BR>
Asked the young, and asked the aged,<BR>
Asked the rich, and asked the needy;<BR>
Did not give an invitation<BR>
To the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Island-dweller of the ocean.</P>
