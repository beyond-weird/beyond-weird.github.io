<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">ILMARINEN'S FRUITLESS WOOING.</H1>
<P>ILMARINEN, the magician,<BR>
The eternal metal-artist,<BR>
Lays aside the golden image,<BR>
Beauteous maid of magic metals;<BR>
Throws the harness on his courser,<BR>
Binds him to his sledge of birch-wood,<BR>
Seats himself upon the cross-bench,<BR>
Snaps the whip above the racer,<BR>
Thinking once again to journey<BR>
To the mansions of Pohyola,<BR>
There to woo a bride in honor,<BR>
Second daughter of the Northland.</P>
<P>On he journeyed, restless, northward,<BR>
Journeyed one day, then a second,<BR>
So the third from morn till evening,<BR>
When he reached a Northland-village<BR>
On the plains of Sariola.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Standing in the open court-yard,<BR>
Spied the hero, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Thus addressed the metal-worker:<BR>
"Tell me how my child is living,<BR>
How the Bride of Beauty prospers,<BR>
As a daughter to thy mother."</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Head bent down and brow dejected,<BR>
Thus addressed the Northland hostess:<BR>
"O, thou dame of Sariola,<BR>
Do not ask me of thy daughter,<BR>
Since, alas I in Tuonela<BR>
Sleeps the Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Sleeps in death the Bride, of Beauty,<BR>
Underneath the fragrant heather,<BR>
In the kingdom of Manala.<BR>
Come I for a second daughter,<BR>
For the fairest of thy virgins.<BR>
Beauteous hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Give to me thy youngest maiden,<BR>
For my former wife's compartments,<BR>
For the chambers of her sister."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Foolish was the Northland-hostess,<BR>
When she gave her fairest virgin,<BR>
In the bloom of youth and beauty<BR>
To the blacksmith of Wainola,<BR>
Only to be led to Mana,<BR>
Like a lambkin to the slaughter!<BR>
I shall never give my daughter,<BR>
Shall not give my youngest maiden<BR>
Bride of thine to be hereafter,<BR>
Life-companion at thy fireside.<BR>
Sooner would I give the fair one<BR>
To the cataract and whirlpool,<BR>
To the river of Manala,<BR>
To the waters of Tuoni!"</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Drew away his head, disdainful,<BR>
Shook his sable locks in anger,<BR>
Entered to the inner court-room,<BR>
Where the maiden sat in waiting,<BR>
Spake these measures to the daughter:<BR>
"Come with me, thou bright-eyed maiden,<BR>
To the cottage where thy sister<BR>
Lived and lingered in contentment,<BR>
Baked for me the toothsome biscuit,<BR>
Brewed for me the beer of barley,<BR>
Kept my dwelling-place in order."</P>
<P>On the floor a babe was lying,<BR>
Thus he sang to Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Uninvited, leave this mansion,<BR>
Go, thou stranger, from this dwelling;<BR>
Once before thou camest hither,<BR>
Only bringing pain and trouble,<BR>
Filling all our hearts with sorrow.<BR>
Fairest daughter of my mother,<BR>
Do not give this suitor welcome,<BR>
Look not on his eyes with pleasure,<BR>
Nor admire his form and features.<BR>
In his mouth are only wolf-teeth,<BR>
Cunning fox-claws in his mittens,<BR>
In his shoes art only bear-claws,<BR>
In his belt a hungry dagger;<BR>
Weapons these of blood and murder,<BR>
Only worn by the unworthy."</P>
<P>Then the daughter spake as follows<BR>
To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Follow thee this maid will never,<BR>
Never heed unworthy suitors;<BR>
Thou hast slain the Bride of Beauty,<BR>
Once the Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Thou wouldst also slay her sister.<BR>
I deserve a better suitor,<BR>
Wish a truer, nobler husband,<BR>
Wish to ride in richer sledges,<BR>
Have a better home-protection;<BR>
Never will I sweep the cottage<BR>
And the coal-place of a blacksmith."</P>
<P>Then the hero, Ilmarinen,<BR>
The eternal metal-artist,<BR>
Turned his head away, disdainful,<BR>
Shook his sable locks in anger,<BR>
Quickly seized the trembling maiden,<BR>
Held her in his grasp of iron,<BR>
Hastened from the court of Louhi<BR>
To his sledge upon the highway.<BR>
In his sleigh he seats the virgin,<BR>
Snugly wraps her in his far-robes,<BR>
Snaps his whip above the racer,<BR>
Gallops on the high-road homeward;<BR>
With one hand the reins be tightens,<BR>
With the other holds the maiden.<BR>
Speaks the virgin-daughter, weeping:<BR>
We have reached the lowland-berries,<BR>
Here the herbs of water-borders;<BR>
Leave me here to sink and perish<BR>
As a child of cold misfortune.<BR>
Wicked Ilmarinen, Iisten!<BR>
If thou dost not quickly free me,<BR>
I will break thy sledge to pieces,<BR>
Throw thy fur-robes to the north-winds."<BR>
Ilmarinen makes this answer:<BR>
"When the blacksmith builds his snow-sledge,<BR>
All the parts are hooped with iron;<BR>
Therefore will the beauteous maiden<BR>
Never beat my sledge to fragments."</P>
<P>Then the silver-tinselled daughter<BR>
Wept and wailed in bitter accents,<BR>
Wrung her hands in desperation,<BR>
Spake again to Ilmarinen:<BR>
"If thou dost not quickly free me,<BR>
I shall change to ocean-salmon,<BR>
Be a whiting of the waters."</P>
<P>"Thou wilt never thus escape me,<BR>
As a pike I'll fleetly follow."</P>
<P>Then the maiden of Pohyola<BR>
Wept and wailed in bitter accents,<BR>
Wrung her hands in desperation,<BR>
Spake again to Ilmarinen;<BR>
"If thou dost not quickly free me,<BR>
I shall hasten to the forest,<BR>
Mid the rocks become an ermine!"</P>
<P>"Thou wilt never thus escape me,<BR>
As a serpent I will follow."</P>
<P>Then the beauty of the Northland,<BR>
Wailed and wept in bitter accents,<BR>
Wrung her hands in desperation,<BR>
Spake once more to Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Surely, if thou dost not free me,<BR>
As a lark I'll fly the ether,<BR>
Hide myself within the storm-clouds."</P>
<P>"Neither wilt thou thus escape me,<BR>
As an eagle I will follow."</P>
<P>They had gone but little distance,<BR>
When the courser shied and halted,<BR>
Frighted at some passing object;<BR>
And the maiden looked in wonder,<BR>
In the snow beheld some foot-prints,<BR>
Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<BR>
Who has run across our highway?"<BR>
"'Tis the timid hare", he answered.<BR>
Thereupon the stolen maiden<BR>
Sobbed, and moaned, in deeps of sorrow,<BR>
Heavy-hearted, spake these measures:<BR>
"Woe is me, ill-fated virgin!<BR>
Happier far my life hereafter,<BR>
If the hare I could but follow<BR>
To his burrow in the woodlands!<BR>
Crook-leg's fur to me is finer<BR>
Than the robes of Ilmarinen."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, the magician,<BR>
Tossed his head in full resentment,<BR>
Galloped on the highway homeward,<BR>
Travelled but a little distance,<BR>
When again his courser halted,<BR>
Frighted at some passing stranger.<BR>
Quick the maiden looked and wondered,<BR>
In the snow beheld some foot-prints,<BR>
Spake these measures to the blacksmith:<BR>
Who has crossed our snowy pathway?"</P>
<P>"'Tis a fox", replied the minstrel.<BR>
Thereupon the beauteous virgin<BR>
Moaned again in depths of anguish,<BR>
Sang these accents, heavy-hearted:<BR>
"Woe is me, ill-fated maiden!<BR>
Happier far my life hereafter,<BR>
With the cunning fox to wander,<BR>
Than with this ill-mannered suitor;<BR>
Reynard's fur to me is finer<BR>
Than the robes of Ilmarinen."</P>
<P>Thereupon the metal-worker<BR>
Shut his lips in sore displeasure,<BR>
Hastened on the highway homeward;<BR>
Travelled but a little distance,<BR>
When again his courser halted.</P>
<P>Quick the maiden looked in wonder,<BR>
in the snow beheld some foot-prints,<BR>
Spake these words to the magician:<BR>
Who again has crossed our pathway?"</P>
<P>"'Tis the wolf", said Ilmarinen.<BR>
Thereupon the fated daughter<BR>
Fell again to bitter weeping,<BR>
And Intoned these words of sorrow:<BR>
"Woe is me, a hapless maiden!<BR>
Happier far my life hereafter,<BR>
Brighter far would be my future,<BR>
If these tracks I could but follow;<BR>
On the wolf the hair is finer<BR>
Than the furs of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Faithless suitor of the Northland."</P>
<P>Then the minstrel of Wainola<BR>
Closed his lips again in anger,<BR>
Shook his sable locks, resentful,<BR>
Snapped the whip above the racer,<BR>
And the steed flew onward swiftly,<BR>
O'er the way to Kalevala,<BR>
To the village of the blacksmith.</P>
<P>Sad and weary from his journey,<BR>
Ilmarinen, home-returning,<BR>
Fell upon his couch in slumber,<BR>
And the maiden laughed derision.</P>
<P>In the morning, slowly waking,<BR>
Head confused, and locks dishevelled,<BR>
Spake the wizard, words as follow:<BR>
"Shall I set myself to singing<BR>
Magic songs and incantations?<BR>
Shall I now enchant this maiden<BR>
To a black-wolf on the mountains,<BR>
To a salmon of the ocean?<BR>
Shall not send her to the woodlands,<BR>
All the forest would be frighted;<BR>
Shall not send her to the waters,<BR>
All the fish would flee in terror;<BR>
This my sword shall drink her life-blood,<BR>
End her reign of scorn and hatred."</P>
<P>Quick the sword feels his intention,<BR>
Quick divines his evil purpose,<BR>
Speaks these words to Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Was not born to drink the life-blood<BR>
Of a maiden pure and lovely,<BR>
Of a fair but helpless virgin."<BR>
Thereupon the magic minstrel,<BR>
Filled with rage, began his singing;<BR>
Sang the very rocks asunder,<BR>
Till the distant hills re-echoed;<BR>
Sang the maiden to a sea-gull,<BR>
Croaking from the ocean-ledges,<BR>
Calling from the ocean-islands,<BR>
Screeching on the sandy sea-coast,<BR>
Flying to the winds opposing.<BR>
When his conjuring had ended,<BR>
Ilmarinen joined his snow-sledge,<BR>
Whipped his steed upon a gallop,<BR>
Hastened to his ancient smithy,<BR>
To his home in Kalevala.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Comes to meet him on the highway,<BR>
Speaks these words to the magician:<BR>
"Ilmarinen, worthy brother,<BR>
Wherefore comest heavy-hearted<BR>
From the dismal Sariola?<BR>
Does Pohyola live and prosper?<BR>
Spake the minstrel, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Why should not Pohyola prosper?<BR>
There the Sampo grinds unceasing,<BR>
Noisy rocks the lid in colors;<BR>
Grinds one day the flour for eating,<BR>
Grinds the second flour for selling,<BR>
Grinds the third day flour for keeping;<BR>
Thus it is Pohyola prospers.<BR>
While the Sampo is in Northland,<BR>
There is plowing, there is sowing,<BR>
There is growth of every virtue,<BR>
There is welfare never-ending."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Ilmarinen, artist-brother,<BR>
Where then is the Northland-daughter,<BR>
Far renowned and beauteous maiden,<BR>
For whose hand thou hast been absent?<BR>
These the words of Ilmarinen:<BR>
"I have changed the hateful virgin<BR>
To a sea-gull on the ocean;<BR>
Now she calls above the waters,<BR>
Screeches from the ocean-islands;<BR>
On the rocks she calls and murmurs<BR>
Vainly calling for a suitor."</P>
