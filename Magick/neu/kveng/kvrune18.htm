<P>WAINAMOINEN, old and truthful,<BR>
Long considered, long debated,<BR>
How to woo and win the daughter<BR>
Of the hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
How to lead the Bride of Beauty,<BR>
Fairy maiden of the rainbow,<BR>
To the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
From the dismal Sariola.</P>
<P>Now he decks his magic vessel,<BR>
Paints the boat in blue and scarlet,<BR>
Trims in gold the ship's forecastle,<BR>
Decks the prow in molten silver;<BR>
Sings his magic ship down gliding,<BR>
On the cylinders of fir-tree:<BR>
Now erects the masts of pine-wood,<BR>
On each mast the sails of linen,<BR>
Sails of blue, and white, and scarlet,<BR>
Woven into finest fabric.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
Steps aboard his wondrous vessel,<BR>
Steers the bark across the waters,<BR>
On the blue back of the broad-sea,<BR>
Speaks these words in sailing northward,<BR>
Sailing to the dark Pohyola:<BR>
"Come aboard my ship, O Ukko,<BR>
Come with me, thou God of mercy,<BR>
To protect thine ancient hero,<BR>
To support thy trusting servant,<BR>
On the breasts of raging billows,<BR>
On the far out-stretching waters.</P>
<P>"Rock, O winds, this wondrous vessel,<BR>
Causing not a single ripple;<BR>
Rolling waves, bear ye me northward,<BR>
That the oar may not be needed<BR>
In my journey to Pohyola,<BR>
O'er this mighty waste of waters."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen's beauteous sister,<BR>
Fair and goodly maid, Annikki,<BR>
Of the Night and Dawn, the daughter,<BR>
Who awakes each morning early,<BR>
Rises long before the daylight,<BR>
Stood one morning on the sea-shore,<BR>
Washing in the foam her dresses,<BR>
Rinsing out her silken ribbons,<BR>
On the bridge of scarlet color,<BR>
On the border of the highway,<BR>
On a headland jutting seaward,<BR>
On the forest-covered island.<BR>
Here Annikki, looking round her,<BR>
Looking through the fog and ether,<BR>
Looking through the clouds of heaven,<BR>
Gazing far out on the blue-sea,<BR>
Sees the morning sun arising,<BR>
Glimmering along the billows,<BR>
Looks with eyes of distant vision<BR>
Toward the sunrise on the waters,<BR>
Toward the winding streams of Suomi,<BR>
Where the Wina-waves were flowing.</P>
<P>There she sees, on the horizon,<BR>
Something darkle in the sunlight,<BR>
Something blue upon the billows,<BR>
Speaks these words in wonder guessing:<BR>
What is this upon the surges,<BR>
What this blue upon the waters,<BR>
What this darkling in the sunlight?<BR>
'Tis perhaps a flock of wild-geese,<BR>
Or perchance the blue-duck flying;<BR>
Then upon thy wings arising,<BR>
Fly away to highest heaven.</P>
<P>"Art thou then a shoal of sea-trout,<BR>
Or perchance a school of salmon?<BR>
Dive then to the deep sea-bottom,<BR>
In the waters swim and frolic.</P>
<P>"Art thou then a cliff of granite,<BR>
Or perchance a mighty oak-tree,<BR>
Floating on the rough sea-billows?<BR>
May the floods then wash and beat thee<BR>
Break thee to a thousand fragments."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, sailing northward,<BR>
Steers his wondrous ship of magic<BR>
Toward the headland jutting seaward,<BR>
Toward the island forest-covered.</P>
<P>Now Annikki, goodly maiden,<BR>
Sees it is the magic vessel<BR>
Of a wonderful enchanter,<BR>
Of a mighty bard and hero,<BR>
And she asks this simple question:<BR>
"Art thou then my father's vessel,<BR>
Or my brother's ship of magic?<BR>
Haste away then to thy harbor,<BR>
To thy refuge in Wainola.<BR>
Hast thou come a goodly distance?<BR>
Sail then farther on thy journey,<BR>
Point thy prow to other waters."</P>
<P>It was not her father's vessel,<BR>
Not a sail-boat from the distance,<BR>
'Twas the ship of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Bark of the eternal singer;<BR>
Sails within a hailing distance,<BR>
Swims still nearer o'er the waters,<BR>
Brings one word and takes another,<BR>
Brings a third of magic import.</P>
<P>Speaks the goodly maid, Annikki,<BR>
Of the Night and Dawn, the daughter,<BR>
To the sailor of the vessel:<BR>
"Whither sailest, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Whither bound, thou friend of waters,<BR>
Pride and joy of Kalevala?"</P>
<P>From the vessel Wainamomen<BR>
Gives this answer to the maiden:<BR>
"I have come to catch some sea-trout,<BR>
Catch the young and toothsome whiting,<BR>
Hiding in tbese-reeds and rushes."<BR>
This the answer of Annikki:</P>
<P>"Do not speak to me in falsehood,<BR>
Know I well the times of fishing;<BR>
Long ago my honored father<BR>
Was a fisherman in Northland,<BR>
Came to catch the trout and whiting,<BR>
Fished within these seas and rivers.<BR>
Very well do I remember<BR>
How the fisherman disposes,<BR>
How he rigs his fishing vessel,<BR>
Lines, and gaffs, and poles, and fish-nets;<BR>
Hast not come a-fishing hither.<BR>
Whither goest, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Whither sailest, friend of waters?<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"I have come to catch some wild-geese,<BR>
Catch the hissing birds of Suomi,<BR>
In these far-extending borders,<BR>
In the Sachsensund dominions."<BR>
Good Annikki gives this answer:<BR>
"Know I well a truthful speaker,<BR>
Easily detect a falsehood;<BR>
Formerly my aged father<BR>
Often came a-hunting hither,<BR>
Came to hunt the hissing wild-geese,<BR>
Hunt the red-bill of these waters.<BR>
Very well do I remember<BR>
How the hunter rigs his vessel,<BR>
Bows, and arrows, knives, and quiver,<BR>
Dogs enchained within the vessel,<BR>
Pointers hunting on the sea-shore,<BR>
Setters seeking in the marshes,<BR>
Tell the truth now Wainamoinen,<BR>
Whither is thy vessel sailing?"<BR>
Spake the hero of the Northland:<BR>
"To the wars my ship is sailing,<BR>
To the bloody fields of battle,<BR>
Where the streams run scarlet-colored,<BR>
Where the paths are paved with bodies!'<BR>
These the words of fair Annikki:<BR>
"Know I well the paths to battle.<BR>
Formerly my aged father<BR>
Often sounded war's alarum,<BR>
Often led the hosts to conquest;<BR>
In each ship a hundred rowers,<BR>
And in arms a thousand heroes,<BR>
Oil the prow a thousand cross-bows,<BR>
Swords, and spears, and battle-axes;<BR>
Know I well the ship of battle.<BR>
Speak Do longer fruitless falsehoods,<BR>
Whither sailest, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Whither steerest, friend of waters?<BR>
These the words of Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Come, O maiden, to my vessel,<BR>
In my magic ship be seated,<BR>
Then I'll give thee truthful answer."</P>
<P>Thus Annikki, silver-tinselled,<BR>
Answers ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"With the winds I'll fill thy vessel,<BR>
To thy bark I'll send the storm-winds<BR>
And capsize thy ship of magic,<BR>
Break in pieces its forecastle,<BR>
If the truth thou dost not tell me,<BR>
If thou dost not cease thy falsehoods,<BR>
If thou dost not tell me truly<BR>
Whither sails thy magic vessel."<BR>
These the words of Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Now I make thee truthful answer,<BR>
Though at first I spake deception:<BR>
I am sailing to the Northland<BR>
To the dismal Sariola,<BR>
Where the ogres live and flourish,<BR>
Where they drown the worthy heroes,<BR>
There to woo the Maid of Beauty<BR>
Sitting on the bow of heaven,<BR>
Woo and win the fairy virgin,<BR>
Bring her to my home and kindred,<BR>
To the firesides of Walnola."</P>
<P>Then Aunikki, graceful maiden,<BR>
Of the Night and Dawn, the daughter,<BR>
As she heard the rightful answer,<BR>
Knew the truth was fully spoken,<BR>
Straightway left her coats unbeaten,<BR>
Left unwashed her linen garments,<BR>
Left unrinsed her silks and ribbons<BR>
On the highway by the sea-shore,<BR>
On the bridge of scarlet color<BR>
On her arm she threw her long-robes,<BR>
Hastened off with speed of roebuck<BR>
To the shops of Ilmarinen,<BR>
To the iron-forger's furnace,<BR>
To the blacksmith's home and smithy,<BR>
Here she found the hero-artist,<BR>
Forging out a bench of iron,<BR>
And adorning it with silver.<BR>
Soot lay thick upon his forehead,<BR>
Soot and coal upon his shoulders.</P>
<P>On the threshold speaks Annikki,<BR>
These the words his sister uses:<BR>
"Ilmarinen, dearest brother,<BR>
Thou eternal artist-forger,<BR>
Forge me now a loom of silver,<BR>
Golden rings to grace my fingers,<BR>
Forge me gold and silver ear-rings,<BR>
Six or seven golden girdles,<BR>
Golden crosslets for my bosom,<BR>
For my head forge golden trinkets,<BR>
And I'll tell a tale surprising,<BR>
Tell a story that concerns thee<BR>
Truthfully I'll tell the story."</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith Ilmarinen<BR>
Spake and these the words he uttered:<BR>
"If thou'lt tell the tale sincerely,<BR>
I will forge the loom of silver,<BR>
Golden rings to grace thy fingers,<BR>
Forge thee gold and silver ear-rings,<BR>
Six or seven golden girdles,<BR>
Golden crosslets for thy bosom,<BR>
For thy head forge golden trinkets;<BR>
But if thou shouldst tell me falsely,<BR>
I shall break thy beauteous jewels,<BR>
Break thine ornaments in pieces,<BR>
Hurl them to the fire and furnace,<BR>
Never forge thee other trinkets."<BR>
This the answer of Annikki:<BR>
"Ancient blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Dost thou ever think to marry<BR>
Her already thine affianced,<BR>
Beauteous Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Fairest virgin of the Northland,<BR>
Chosen bride of Sariola?<BR>
Shouldst thou wish the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
Thou must forge, and forge unceasing,<BR>
Hammering the days and nights through;<BR>
Forge the summer hoofs for horses,<BR>
Forge them iron hoofs for winter,<BR>
In the long nights forge the snow-sledge,<BR>
Gaily trim it in the daytime,<BR>
Haste thou then upon thy journey<BR>
To thy wooing in the Northland,<BR>
To the dismal Sariola;<BR>
Thither journeys one more clever,<BR>
Sails another now before thee,<BR>
There to woo thy bride affianced,<BR>
Thence to lead thy chosen virgin,<BR>
Woo and win the Maid of Beauty;<BR>
Three long years thou hast been wooing.<BR>
Wainamoinen now is sailing<BR>
On the blue back of the waters,<BR>
Sitting at his helm of copper;<BR>
On the prow are golden carvings,<BR>
Beautiful his boat of magic,<BR>
Sailing fleetly o'er the billows,<BR>
To the never-pleasant Northland,<BR>
To the dismal Sariola."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen stood in wonder,<BR>
Stood a statue at the story;<BR>
Silent grief had settled o'er him,<BR>
Settled o'er the iron-artist;<BR>
From one hand the tongs descended,<BR>
From the other fell the hammer,<BR>
As the blacksmith made this answer:<BR>
"Good Annikki, worthy sister,<BR>
I shall forge the loom of silver,<BR>
Golden rings to grace thy fingers,<BR>
Forge thee gold and silver ear-rings,<BR>
Six or seven golden girdles,<BR>
Golden crosslets for thy bosom;<BR>
Go and heat for me the bath-room,<BR>
Fill with heat the honey-chambers,<BR>
Lay the faggots on the fire-place,<BR>
Lay the smaller woods around them,<BR>
Pour some water through the ashes,<BR>
Make a soap of magic virtue,<BR>
Thus to cleanse my blackened visage,<BR>
Thus to cleanse the blacksmith's body,<BR>
Thus remove the soot and ashes."</P>
<P>Then Annikki, kindly sister,<BR>
Quickly warmed her brother's bath-room,<BR>
Warmed it with the knots of fir-trees,<BR>
That the thunder-winds had broken;<BR>
Gathered pebbles from the fire-stream,<BR>
Threw them in the heating waters;<BR>
Broke the tassels from the birch-trees,<BR>
Steeped the foliage in honey,<BR>
Made a lye from milk and ashes,<BR>
Made of these a strong decoction,<BR>
Mixed it with the fat and marrow<BR>
Of the reindeer of the mountains,<BR>
Made a soap of magic virtue,<BR>
Thus to cleanse the iron-artist,<BR>
Thus to beautify the suitor,<BR>
Thus to make the hero worthy.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, ancient blacksmith,<BR>
The eternal metal-worker,<BR>
Forged the wishes of his sister,<BR>
Ornaments for fair Annikki,<BR>
Rings, and bracelets, pins and ear-drops,<BR>
Forged for her six golden girdles,<BR>
Forged a weaving loom of silver,<BR>
While the maid prepared the bath-room,<BR>
Set his toilet-room in order.</P>
<P>To the maid he gave the trinkets,<BR>
Gave the loom of molten silver,<BR>
And the sister thus made answer:<BR>
"I have heated well thy bath-room,<BR>
Have thy toilet-things in order,<BR>
Everything as thou desirest;<BR>
Go prepare thyself for wooing,<BR>
Lave thy bead to flaxen whiteness,<BR>
Make thy cheeks look fresh and ruddy,<BR>
Lave thyself in Love's aroma,<BR>
That thy wooing prove successful."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, magic artist,<BR>
Quick repairing to his bath-room,<BR>
Bathed his head to flaxen whiteness,<BR>
Made his cheeks look fresh and ruddy,<BR>
Laved his eyes until they sparkled<BR>
Like the moonlight on the waters;<BR>
Wondrous were his form and features,<BR>
And his cheeks like ruddy berries.<BR>
These the words of Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Fair Annikki, lovely sister,<BR>
Bring me now my silken raiment,<BR>
Bring my best and richest vesture,<BR>
Bring me now my softest linen,<BR>
That my wooing prove successful."</P>
<P>Straightway did the helpful sister<BR>
Bring the finest of his raiment,<BR>
Bring the softest of his linen,<BR>
Raiment fashioned by his mother;<BR>
Brought to him his silken stockings,<BR>
Brought him shoes of marten-leather,<BR>
Brought a vest of sky-blue color,<BR>
Brought him scarlet-colored trousers,<BR>
Brought a coat with scarlet trimming,<BR>
Brought a red shawl trimmed in ermine<BR>
Fourfold wrapped about his body;<BR>
Brought a fur-coat made of seal-skin,<BR>
Fastened with a thousand bottons,<BR>
And adorned with countless jewels;<BR>
Brought for him his magic girdle,<BR>
Fastened well with golden buckles,<BR>
That his artist-mother fashioned;<BR>
Brought him gloves with golden wristlets,<BR>
That the Laplanders had woven<BR>
For a head of many ringlets;<BR>
Brought the finest cap in Northland,<BR>
That his ancient father purchased<BR>
When he first began his wooing.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, blacksmith-artist,<BR>
Clad himself to look his finest,<BR>
When he thus addressed a servant:<BR>
"Hitch for me a fleet-foot racer,<BR>
Hitch him to my willing snow-sledge,<BR>
For I start upon a journey<BR>
To the distant shores of Pohya,<BR>
To the dismal Sariola."<BR>
Spake the servant thus in answer:<BR>
"Thou hast seven fleet-foot racers,<BR>
Munching grain within their mangers,<BR>
Which of these shall I make ready?"<BR>
Spake the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Take the fleetest of my coursers,<BR>
Put the gray steed in the harness,<BR>
Hitch him to my sledge of magic;<BR>
Place six cuckoos on the break-board,<BR>
Seven bluebirds on the cross-bars,<BR>
Thus to charm the Northland maidens,<BR>
Thus to make them look and listen,<BR>
As the cuckoos call and echo.<BR>
Bring me too my largest bear-skin,<BR>
Fold it warm about the cross-bench;<BR>
Bring me then my marten fur-robes,<BR>
As a cover and protection."</P>
<P>Straightway then the trusty servant<BR>
Of the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Put the gray steed in the harness,<BR>
Hitched the racer to the snow-sledge,<BR>
Placed six cuckoos on the break-board,<BR>
Seven bluebirds on the cross-bars,<BR>
On the front to sing and twitter;<BR>
Then he brought the largest bear-skin,<BR>
Folded it upon the cross-bench;<BR>
Brought the finest robes of marten,<BR>
Warm protection for the master.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, forger-artist,<BR>
The eternal metal-worker,<BR>
Earnestly entreated Ukko:<BR>
"Send thy snow-flakes, Ukko, father,<BR>
Let them gently fall from heaven,<BR>
Let them cover all the heather,<BR>
Let them hide the berry-bushes,<BR>
That my sledge may glide in freedom<BR>
O'er the hills to Sariola!"</P>
<P>Ukko sent the snow from heaven,<BR>
Gently dropped the crystal snow-flakes,<BR>
Lending thus his kind assistance<BR>
To the hero, Ilmarinen,<BR>
On his journey to the Northland.</P>
<P>Reins in hand, the ancient artist<BR>
Seats him in his metal snow-sledge,<BR>
And beseeches thus his Master:<BR>
"Good luck to my reins and traces,<BR>
Good luck to my shafts and runners!<BR>
God protect my magic snow-sledge,<BR>
Be my safeguard on my journey<BR>
To the dismal Sariola!"</P>
<P>Now the ancient Ilmarinen<BR>
Draws the reins upon the racer,<BR>
Snaps his whip above the courser,<BR>
To the gray steed gives this order,<BR>
And the charger plunges northward:<BR>
"Haste away, my flaxen stallion,<BR>
Haste thee onward, noble white-face,<BR>
To the never-pleasant Pohya,<BR>
To the dreary Sariola!"</P>
<P>Fast and faster flies the fleet-foot,<BR>
On the curving snow-capped sea-coast,<BR>
On the borders of the lowlands,<BR>
O'er the alder-hills and mountains.<BR>
Merrily the steed flies onward,<BR>
Bluebirds singing, cuckoos calling,<BR>
On the sea-shore looking northward,<BR>
Through the sand and falling snow-flakes<BR>
Blinding winds, and snow, and sea-foam,<BR>
Cloud the hero, Ilmarinen,<BR>
As he glides upon his journey,<BR>
Looking seaward for the vessel<BR>
Of the ancient Wainamoinen;<BR>
Travels one day, then a second,<BR>
Travels all the next day northward,<BR>
Till the third day Ilmarinen<BR>
Overtakes old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Rails him in his magic vessel,<BR>
And addresses thus the minstrel:<BR>
"O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Let us woo in peace the maiden,<BR>
Fairest daughter or the Northland,<BR>
Sitting on the bow of heaven,<BR>
Let each labor long to win her,<BR>
Let her wed the one she chooses,<BR>
Him selecting, let her follow."<BR>
Wainamoinen thus makes answer:<BR>
"I agree to thy proposal,<BR>
Let us woo in peace the maiden,<BR>
Not by force, nor faithless measures,<BR>
Shall we woo the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
Let her follow him she chooses;<BR>
Let the unsuccessful suitor<BR>
Harbor neither wrath nor envy<BR>
For the hero that she follows."</P>
<P>Thus agreeing, on they journey,<BR>
Each according to his pleasure;<BR>
Fleetly does the steed fly onward,<BR>
Quickly flies the magic vessel,<BR>
Sailing on the broad-sea northward;<BR>
Ilmarinen's fleet-foot racer<BR>
Makes the hills of Northland tremble,<BR>
As he gallops on his journey<BR>
To the dismal Sariola.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen calls the South-winds,<BR>
And they fly to his assistance;<BR>
Swiftly sails his ship of beauty,<BR>
Swiftly plows the rough sea-billows<BR>
In her pathway to Pohyola.</P>
<P>Time had gone but little distance,<BR>
Scarce a moment had passed over,<BR>
Ere the dogs began their barking,<BR>
In the mansions of the Northland,<BR>
In the courts of Sariola,<BR>
Watch-dogs of the court of Louhi;<BR>
Never had they growled so fiercely,<BR>
Never had they barked so loudly,<BR>
Never with their tails had beaten<BR>
Northland into such an uproar.<BR>
Spake the master of Pohyola:<BR>
"Go and learn, my worthy daughter,<BR>
Why the watch-dogs have been barking,<BR>
Why the black-dog signals danger."<BR>
Quickly does the daughter answer:<BR>
"I am occupied, dear father,<BR>
I have work of more importance,<BR>
I must tend my flock of lambkins,<BR>
I must turn the nether millstone,<BR>
Grind to flour the grains of barley,<BR>
Run the grindings through the sifter,<BR>
Only have I time for grinding."</P>
<P>Lowly growls the faithful watch-dog,<BR>
Seldom does he growl so strangely.<BR>
Spake the master of Pohyola:<BR>
"Go and learn, my trusted consort,<BR>
Why the Northland dogs are barking,<BR>
Why the black-dog signals danger."<BR>
Thus his aged wife makes answer;<BR>
"Have no time, nor inclination,<BR>
I must feed my hungry household,<BR>
Must prepare a worthy dinner,<BR>
I must bake the toothsome biscuit,<BR>
Knead the dough till it is ready,<BR>
Only have I strength for kneading."<BR>
Spake the master of Pohyola:<BR>
"Dames are always in a hurry,<BR>
Maidens too are ever busy,<BR>
Whether warming at the oven,<BR>
Or asleep upon their couches;<BR>
Go my son, and learn the danger,<BR>
Why the black-dog growls displeasure,"<BR>
Quickly does the son give answer:<BR>
"Have no time, nor inclination,<BR>
Am in haste to grind my hatchet;<BR>
I must chop this log to cordwood,<BR>
For the fire must cut the faggots,<BR>
I must split the wood in fragments,<BR>
Large the pile and small the fire-wood,<BR>
Only have I strength for chopping."</P>
<P>Still the watch-dog growls in anger,<BR>
Growl the whelps within the mansion,<BR>
Growl the dogs chained in the kennel,<BR>
Growls the black-dog on the hill-top,<BR>
Setting Northland in an uproar.<BR>
Spake the master of Pohyola:<BR>
"Never, never does my black-dog<BR>
Growl like this without a reason;<BR>
Never does he bark for nothing,<BR>
Does not growl at angry billows,<BR>
Nor the sighing of the pine-trees."</P>
<P>Then the master of Pohyola<BR>
Went himself to learn the reason<BR>
For the barking of the watch-dogs;<BR>
Strode he through the spacious court-yard,<BR>
Through the open fields beyond it,<BR>
To the summit of the uplands.<BR>
Looking toward his black-dog barking,<BR>
He beholds the muzzle pointed<BR>
To a distant, stormy hill-top,<BR>
To a mound with alders covered;<BR>
There he learned the rightful reason,<BR>
Why his dogs had barked so loudly,<BR>
Why had growled the wool-tail bearer,<BR>
Why his whelps had signalled danger.<BR>
At full sail, he saw a vessel,<BR>
And the ship was scarlet-colored,<BR>
Entering the bay of Lempo;<BR>
Saw a sledge of magic colors,<BR>
Gliding up the curving sea-shore,<BR>
O'er the snow-fields of Pohyola.</P>
<P>Then the master of the Northland<BR>
Hastened straightway to his dwelling,<BR>
Hastened forward to his court-room,<BR>
These the accents of the master:<BR>
"Often strangers journey hither,<BR>
On the blue back of the ocean,<BR>
Sailing in a scarlet vessel,<BR>
Rocking in the bay of Lempo;<BR>
Often strangers come in sledges<BR>
To the honey-lands of Louhi."</P>
<P>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
How shall we obtain a token<BR>
Why these strangers journey hither?<BR>
My beloved, faithful daughter,<BR>
Lay a branch upon the fire-place,<BR>
Let it burn with fire of magic<BR>
If it trickle drops of scarlet,<BR>
War and bloodshed do they bring us;<BR>
If it trickle drops of water,<BR>
Peace and plenty bring the strangers."</P>
<P>Northland's fair and slender maiden,<BR>
Beautiful and modest daughter,<BR>
Lays a sorb-branch on the fire-place,<BR>
Lights it with the fire of magic;<BR>
Does not trickle drops of scarlet,<BR>
Trickles neither blood, nor water,<BR>
From the wand come drops of honey.</P>
<P>From the corner spake Suowakko,<BR>
This the language of the wizard:<BR>
"If the wand is dripping honey,<BR>
Then the strangers that are coming<BR>
Are but worthy friends and suitors."</P>
<P>Then the hostess of the Northland,<BR>
With the daughter of the hostess,<BR>
Straightway left their work, and hastened<BR>
From their dwelling to the court-yard;<BR>
Looked about in all directions,<BR>
Turned their eyes upon the waters,<BR>
Saw a magic-colored vessel<BR>
Rocking slowly in the harbor,<BR>
Having sailed the bay of Lempo,<BR>
Triple sails, and masts, and rigging,<BR>
Sable was the nether portion,<BR>
And the upper, scarlet-colored,<BR>
At the helm an ancient hero<BR>
Leaning on his oars of copper;<BR>
Saw a fleet-foot racer running,<BR>
Saw a red sledge lightly follow,<BR>
Saw the magic sledge emblazoned,<BR>
Guided toward the courts of Louhi;<BR>
Saw and heard six golden cuckoos<BR>
Sitting on the break-board, calling,<BR>
Seven bluebirds richly colored<BR>
Singing from the yoke and cross-bar;<BR>
In the sledge a magic hero,<BR>
Young, and strong, and proud, and handsome,<BR>
Holding reins upon the courser.<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Dearest daughter, winsome maiden,<BR>
Dost thou wish a noble suitor?<BR>
Should these heroes come to woo thee,<BR>
Wouldst thou leave thy home and country,<BR>
Be the bride of him that pleases,<BR>
Be his faithful life-companion?</P>
<P>"He that comes upon the waters,<BR>
Sailing in a magic vessel,<BR>
Having sailed the bay of Lempo,<BR>
Is the good, old Wainamoinen;<BR>
In his ship are countless treasures,<BR>
Richest presents from Wainola.</P>
<P>"He that rides here in his snow-sledge<BR>
In his sledge of magic beauty,<BR>
With the cuckoos and the bluebirds,<BR>
Is the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Cometh hither empty-handed,<BR>
Only brings some wisdom-sayings.<BR>
When they come within the dwelling,<BR>
Bring a bowl of honeyed viands,<BR>
Bring a pitcher with two handles,<BR>
Give to him that thou wouldst follow<BR>
Give it to old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Him that brings thee countless treasures,<BR>
Costly presents in his vessel,<BR>
Priceless gems from Kalevala."</P>
<P>Spake the Northland's lovely daughter,<BR>
This the language of the maiden<BR>
"Good, indeed, advice maternal,<BR>
But I will not wed for riches,<BR>
Wed no man for countless treasures;<BR>
For his worth I'll choose a husband,<BR>
For his youth and fine appearance,<BR>
For his noble form and features;<BR>
In the olden times the maidens<BR>
Were not sold by anxious mothers<BR>
To the suitors that they loved not.<BR>
I shall choose without his treasures<BR>
Ilmarinen for his wisdom,<BR>
For his worth and good behavior,<BR>
Him that forged the wondrous Sampo,<BR>
Hammered thee the lid in colors."<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Senseless daughter, child of folly,<BR>
Thus to choose the ancient blacksmith,<BR>
From whose brow drips perspiration,<BR>
Evermore to rinse his linen,<BR>
Lave his hands, and eyes, and forehead,<BR>
Keep his ancient house in order;<BR>
Little use his wit and wisdom<BR>
When compared with gold and silver."<BR>
This the answer of the daughter:<BR>
"I will never, never, never,<BR>
Wed the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
With his gold and priceless jewels;<BR>
Never will I be a helpmate<BR>
To a hero in his dotage,<BR>
Little thanks my compensation."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, safely landing<BR>
In advance of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Pulls his gaily-covered vessel<BR>
From the waves upon the sea-beach,<BR>
On the cylinders of birch-wood,<BR>
On the rollers copper-banded,<BR>
Straightway hastens to the guest-room<BR>
Of the hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Of the master of the Northland,<BR>
Speaks these words upon the threshold<BR>
To the famous Maid of Beauty:<BR>
"Come with me, thou lovely virgin,<BR>
Be my bride and life-companion,<BR>
Share with me my joys and sorrows,<BR>
Be my honored wife hereafter!"<BR>
This the answer of the maiden:<BR>
"Hast thou built for me the vessel,<BR>
Built for me the ship of magic<BR>
From the fragments of the distaff,<BR>
From the splinters of the spindle?"<BR>
Wainamoinen thus replying:<BR>
"I have built the promised vessel,<BR>
Built the wondrous ship for sailing,<BR>
Firmly joined the parts by magic;<BR>
It will weather roughest billows,<BR>
Will outlive the winds and waters,<BR>
Swiftly glide upon the blue-back<BR>
Of the deep and boundless ocean<BR>
It will ride the waves in beauty,<BR>
Like an airy bubble rising,<BR>
Like a cork on lake and river,<BR>
Through the angry seas of Northland,<BR>
Through Pohyola's peaceful waters."</P>
<P>Northland's fair and slender daughter<BR>
Gives this answer to her suitor:<BR>
"Will not wed a sea-born hero,<BR>
Do not care to rock the billows,<BR>
Cannot live with such a husband<BR>
Storms would bring us pain and trouble,<BR>
Winds would rack our hearts and temples;<BR>
Therefore thee I cannot follow,<BR>
Cannot keep thy home in order,<BR>
Cannot be thy life-companion,<BR>
Cannot wed old Wainamoinen."</P>
