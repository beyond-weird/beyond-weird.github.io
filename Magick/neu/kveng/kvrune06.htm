<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WAINAMOINEN'S HAPLFSS JOURNEY.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, old and truthful,<BR>
Now arranges for a journey<BR>
To the village of the Northland,<BR>
To the land of cruel winters,<BR>
To the land of little sunshine,<BR>
To the land of worthy women;<BR>
Takes his light-foot, royal racer,<BR>
Then adjusts the golden bridle,<BR>
Lays upon his back the saddle,<BR>
Silver-buckled, copper-stirruped,<BR>
Seats himself upon his courser,<BR>
And begins his journey northward;<BR>
Plunges onward, onward, onward,<BR>
Galloping along the highway,<BR>
In his saddle, gaily fashioned,<BR>
On his dappled steed of magic,<BR>
Plunging through Wainola's meadows,<BR>
O'er the plains of Kalevala.<BR>
Fast and far he galloped onward,<BR>
Galloped far beyond Wainola,<BR>
Bounded o'er the waste of waters,<BR>
Till he reached the blue-sea's margin,<BR>
Wetting not the hoofs in running.</P>
<P>But the evil Youkahainen<BR>
Nursed a grudge within his bosom,<BR>
In his heart the worm of envy,<BR>
Envy of this Wainamoinen,<BR>
Of this wonderful enchanter.<BR>
He prepares a cruel cross-bow,<BR>
Made of steel and other metals,<BR>
Paints the bow in many colors,<BR>
Molds the top-piece out or copper,<BR>
Trims his bow with snowy silver,<BR>
Gold he uses too in trimming,<BR>
Then he hunts for strongest sinews,<BR>
Finds them in the stag of Hisi,<BR>
Interweaves the flax of Lempo.<BR>
Ready is the cruel cross-bow,<BR>
String, and shaft, and ends are finished,<BR>
Beautiful the bow and mighty,<BR>
Surely cost it not a trifle;<BR>
On the back a painted courser,<BR>
On each end a colt of beauty,<BR>
Near the curve a maiden sleeping<BR>
Near the notch a hare is bounding,<BR>
Wonderful the bow thus fashioned;<BR>
Cuts some arrows for his quiver,<BR>
Covers them with finest feathers,<BR>
From the oak the shafts be fashions,<BR>
Makes the tips of keenest metal.<BR>
As the rods and points are finished,<BR>
Then he feathers well his arrows<BR>
From the plumage of the swallow,<BR>
From the wing-quills of the sparrow;<BR>
Hardens well his feathered arrows,<BR>
And imparts to each new virtues,<BR>
Steeps them in the blood of serpents,<BR>
In the virus of the adder.</P>
<P>Ready now are all his arrows,<BR>
Ready strung, his cruel cross-bow.<BR>
Waiting for wise Wainamoinen.<BR>
Youkahainen, Lapland's minstrel,<BR>
Waits a long time, is not weary,<BR>
Hopes to spy the ancient singer;<BR>
Spies at day-dawn, spies at evening,<BR>
Spies he ceaselessly at noontide,<BR>
Lies in wait for the magician,<BR>
Waits, and watches, as in envy;<BR>
Sits he at the open window,<BR>
Stands behind the hedge, and watches<BR>
In the foot-path waits, and listens,<BR>
Spies along the balks of meadows;<BR>
On his back he hangs his quiver,<BR>
In his quiver, feathered arrows<BR>
Dipped in virus of the viper,<BR>
On his arm the mighty cross-bow,<BR>
Waits, and watches, and unwearied,<BR>
Listens from the boat-house window,<BR>
Lingers at the end of Fog-point,<BR>
By the river flowing seaward,<BR>
Near the holy stream and whirlpool,<BR>
Near the sacred river's fire-fall.</P>
<P>Finally the Lapland minstrel,<BR>
Youkahainen of Pohyola,<BR>
At the breaking of the day-dawn,<BR>
At the early hour of morning,<BR>
Fixed his gaze upon the North-east,<BR>
Turned his eyes upon the sunrise,<BR>
Saw a black cloud on the ocean,<BR>
Something blue upon the waters,<BR>
And soliloquized as follows:<BR>
"Are those clouds on the horizon,<BR>
Or perchance the dawn of morning?<BR>
Neither clouds on the horizon,<BR>
Nor the dawning of the morning;<BR>
It is ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
The renowned and wise enchanter,<BR>
Riding on his way to Northland;<BR>
On his steed, the royal racer,<BR>
Magic courser of Wainola."</P>
<P>Quickly now young Youkahainen,<BR>
Lapland's vain and evil minstrel,<BR>
Filled with envy, grasps his cross-bow,<BR>
Makes his bow and arrows ready<BR>
For the death of Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>Quick his aged mother asked him,<BR>
Spake these words to Youkahainen:<BR>
"For whose slaughter is thy cross-bow,<BR>
For whose heart thy poisoned arrows?"<BR>
Youkahainen thus made answer:<BR>
"I have made this mighty cross-bow,<BR>
Fashioned bow and poisoned arrows<BR>
For the death of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Thus to slay the friend of waters;<BR>
I must shoot the old magician,<BR>
The eternal bard and hero,<BR>
Through the heart, and through the liver,<BR>
Through the head, and through the shoulders,<BR>
With this bow and feathered arrows<BR>
Thus destroy my rival minstrel."</P>
<P>Then the aged mother answered,<BR>
Thus reproving, thus forbidding.<BR>
Do not slay good Wainamoinen,<BR>
Ancient hero of the Northland,<BR>
From a noble tribe descended,<BR>
He, my sister's son, my nephew.<BR>
If thou slayest Wainamoinen,<BR>
Ancient son of Kalevala,<BR>
Then alas! all joy will vanish,<BR>
Perish all our wondrous singing;<BR>
Better on the earth the gladness,<BR>
Better here the magic music,<BR>
Than within the nether regions,<BR>
In the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
In the realm of the departed,<BR>
In the land of the hereafter."</P>
<P>Then the youthful Youkahainen<BR>
Thought awhile and well considered,<BR>
Ere he made a final answer.<BR>
With one hand he raised the cross-bow<BR>
But the other seemed to weaken,<BR>
As he drew the cruel bow-string.<BR>
Finally these words he uttered<BR>
As his bosom swelled with envy:<BR>
"Let all joy forever vanish,<BR>
Let earth's pleasures quickly perish,<BR>
Disappear earth's sweetest music,<BR>
Happiness depart forever;<BR>
Shoot I will this rival minstrel,<BR>
Little heeding what the end is."</P>
<P>Quickly now he bends his fire-bow,<BR>
On his left knee rests the weapon,<BR>
With his right foot firmly planted,<BR>
Thus he strings his bow of envy;<BR>
Takes three arrows from his quiver,<BR>
Choosing well the best among them,<BR>
Carefully adjusts the bow-string,<BR>
Sets with care the feathered arrow,<BR>
To the flaxen string he lays it,<BR>
Holds the cross-bow to his shoulder,<BR>
Aiming well along the margin,<BR>
At the heart of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Waiting till he gallops nearer;<BR>
In the shadow of a thicket,<BR>
Speaks these words while he is waiting<BR>
"Be thou, flaxen string, elastic;<BR>
Swiftly fly, thou feathered ash-wood,<BR>
Swiftly speed, thou deadly missile,<BR>
Quick as light, thou poisoned arrow,<BR>
To the heart of Wainamoinen.<BR>
If my hand too low should hold thee,<BR>
May the gods direct thee higher;<BR>
If too high mine eye should aim thee,<BR>
May the gods direct thee lower."</P>
<P>Steady now he pulls the trigger;<BR>
Like the lightning flies the arrow<BR>
O'er the head of Wainamoinen;<BR>
To the upper sky it darteth,<BR>
And the highest clouds it pierces,<BR>
Scatters all the flock of lamb-clouds,<BR>
On its rapid journey skyward.</P>
<P>Not discouraged, quick selecting,<BR>
Quick adjusting, Youkahainen,<BR>
Quickly aiming shoots a second.<BR>
Speeds the arrow swift as lightning;<BR>
Much too low he aimed the missile,<BR>
Into earth the arrow plunges,<BR>
Pierces to the lower regions,<BR>
Splits in two the old Sand Mountain.</P>
<P>Nothing daunted, Youkahainen,<BR>
Quick adjusting shoots a third one.<BR>
Swift as light it speeds its journey,<BR>
Strikes the steed of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Strikes the light-foot, ocean-swimmer,<BR>
Strikes him near his golden girdle,<BR>
Through the shoulder of the racer.</P>
<P>Thereupon wise Wainamoinen<BR>
Headlong fell upon the waters,<BR>
Plunged beneath the rolling billows,<BR>
From the saddle of the courser,<BR>
From his dappled steed of magic.<BR>
Then arose a mighty storm-wind,<BR>
Roaring wildly on the waters,<BR>
Bore away old Wainamoinen<BR>
Far from land upon the billows,<BR>
On the high and rolling billows,<BR>
On the broad sea's great expanses.</P>
<P>Boasted then young Youkahainen,<BR>
Thinking Waino dead and buried,<BR>
These the boastful words be uttered:<BR>
"Nevermore, old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Nevermore in all thy life-time,<BR>
While the golden moonlight glistens,<BR>
Nevermore wilt fix thy vision<BR>
On the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
On the plains of Kalevala;<BR>
Full six years must swim the ocean,<BR>
Tread the waves for seven summers,<BR>
Eight years ride the foamy billows,<BR>
In the broad expanse of water;<BR>
Six long autumns as a fir-tree,<BR>
Seven winters as a pebble;<BR>
Eight long summers as an aspen."</P>
<P>Thereupon the Lapland minstrel<BR>
Hastened to his room delighting,<BR>
When his mother thus addressed him<BR>
"Hast thou slain good Wainamoinen,<BR>
Slain the son of Kalevala?"<BR>
Youkahainen thus made answer:<BR>
"I have slain old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Slain the son of Kalevala,<BR>
That he now may plow the ocean,<BR>
That he now may sweep the waters,<BR>
On the billows rock and slumber.<BR>
In the salt-sea plunged he headlong,<BR>
In the deep sank the magician,<BR>
Sidewise turned he to the sea-shore<BR>
On his back to rock forever,<BR>
Thus the boundless sea to travel,<BR>
Thus to ride the rolling billows."<BR>
This the answer of the mother:<BR>
"Woe to earth for this thine action,<BR>
Gone forever, joy and singing,<BR>
Vanished is the wit of ages!<BR>
Thou hast slain good Wainamoinen.<BR>
Slain the ancient wisdom-singer,<BR>
Slain the pride of Suwantala,<BR>
Slain the hero of Wainola,<BR>
Slain the joy of Kalevala."</P>
