<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">RUNE VIII.</H1>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">MAIDEN OF THE RAINBOW.</H1>
<P>Pohyola's fair and winsome daughter,<BR>
Glory of the land and water,<BR>
Sat upon the bow of heaven,<BR>
On its highest arch resplendent,<BR>
In a gown of richest fabric,<BR>
In a gold and silver air-gown,<BR>
Weaving webs of golden texture,<BR>
Interlacing threads of silver;<BR>
Weaving with a golden shuttle,<BR>
With a weaving-comb of silver;<BR>
Merrily flies the golden shuttle,<BR>
From the maiden's nimble fingers,<BR>
Briskly swings the lathe in weaving,<BR>
Swiftly flies the comb of silver,<BR>
From the sky-born maiden's fingers,<BR>
Weaving webs of wondrous beauty.</P>
<P>Came the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Driving down the highway homeward,<BR>
From the ever sunless Northland,<BR>
From the dismal Sariola;<BR>
Few the furlongs he had driven,<BR>
Driven but a little distance,<BR>
When he heard the sky-loom buzzing,<BR>
As the maiden plied the shuttle.<BR>
Quick the thoughtless Wainamoinen<BR>
Lifts his eyes aloft in wonder,<BR>
Looks upon the vault of heaven,<BR>
There beholds the bow of beauty,<BR>
On the bow the maiden sitting,<BR>
Beauteous Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Glory of the earth and ocean,<BR>
Weaving there a golden fabric,<BR>
Working with the rustling silver.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Quickly checks his fleet-foot racer,<BR>
Looks upon the charming maiden,<BR>
Then addresses her as follows:<BR>
"Come, fair maiden, to my snow-sledge,<BR>
By my side I wish thee seated."</P>
<P>Thus the Maid of Beauty answers:<BR>
"Tell me what thou wishest of me,<BR>
Should I join thee in the snow-sledge."<BR>
Speaks the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Answers thus the Maid of Beauty:<BR>
"This the reason for thy coming:<BR>
Thou shalt bake me honey-biscuit,<BR>
Shalt prepare me barley-water,<BR>
Thou shalt fill my foaming beer-cups,<BR>
Thou shalt sing beside my table,<BR>
Shalt rejoice within my portals,<BR>
Walk a queen within my dwelling,<BR>
In the Wainola halls and chambers,<BR>
In the courts of Kalevala."</P>
<P>Thus the Maid of Beauty answered<BR>
From her throne amid the heavens:<BR>
"Yesterday at hour of twilight,<BR>
Went I to the flowery meadows,<BR>
There to rock upon the common,<BR>
Where the Sun retires to slumber;<BR>
There I heard a song-bird singing,<BR>
Heard the thrush simple measures,<BR>
Singing sweetly thoughts of maidens,<BR>
And the minds of anxious mothers.</P>
<P>"Then I asked the pretty songster,<BR>
Asked the thrush this simple question:<BR>
'Sing to me, thou pretty song-bird,<BR>
Sing that I may understand thee,<BR>
Sing to me in truthful accents,<BR>
How to live in greatest pleasure,<BR>
And in happiness the sweetest,<BR>
As a maiden with her father,<BR>
Or as wife beside her husband.'</P>
<P>"Thus the song-bird gave me answer,<BR>
Sang the thrush this information:<BR>
'Bright and warm are days of summer,<BR>
Warmer still is maiden-freedom;<BR>
Cold is iron in the winter,<BR>
Thus the lives of married women;<BR>
Maidens living with their mothers<BR>
Are like ripe and ruddy berries;<BR>
Married women, far too many,<BR>
Are like dogs enchained in kennel,<BR>
Rarely do they ask for favors,<BR>
Not to wives are favors given.'"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Answers thus the Maid of Beauty:<BR>
"Foolish is the thrush thus singing,<BR>
Nonsense is the song-bird's twitter;<BR>
Like to babes are maidens treated,<BR>
Wives are queens and highly honored.<BR>
Come, sweet maiden, to my snow-sledge,<BR>
I am not despised as hero,<BR>
Not the meanest of magicians;<BR>
Come with me and I will make thee<BR>
Wife and queen in Kalevala."<BR>
Thus the Maid of Beauty answered--<BR>
"Would consider thee a hero,<BR>
Mighty hero, I would call thee,<BR>
When a golden hair thou splittest,<BR>
Using knives that have no edges;<BR>
When thou snarest me a bird's egg<BR>
With a snare that I can see not."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, skilled and ancient,<BR>
Split a golden hair exactly,<BR>
Using knives that had no edges;<BR>
And he snared an egg as nicely<BR>
With a snare the maiden saw not.</P>
<P>"Come, sweet maiden, to my snow-sledge,<BR>
I have done what thou desirest."<BR>
Thus the maiden wisely answered:<BR>
"Never enter I thy snow-sledge,<BR>
Till thou peelest me the sandstone,<BR>
Till thou cuttest me a whip-stick<BR>
From the ice, and make no splinters,<BR>
Losing not the smallest fragment."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, true magician,<BR>
Nothing daunted, not discouraged,<BR>
Deftly peeled the rounded sandstone,<BR>
Deftly cut from ice a whip-stick,<BR>
Cutting not the finest splinter,<BR>
Losing not the smallest fragment.<BR>
Then again be called the maiden,<BR>
To a seat within his snow-sledge.</P>
<P>But the Maid or Beauty answered,<BR>
Answered thus the great magician:<BR>
I will go with that one only<BR>
That will make me ship or shallop,<BR>
From the splinters of my spindle,<BR>
From the fragments of my distaff,<BR>
In the waters launch the vessel,<BR>
Set the little ship a-floating,<BR>
Using not the knee to push it,<BR>
Using not the arm to move it,<BR>
Using not the hand to touch it,<BR>
Using not the foot to turn it,<BR>
Using nothing to propel it."</P>
<P>Spake the skilful Wainamoinen,<BR>
These the words the hero uttered:<BR>
"There is no one in the Northland,<BR>
No one under vault of heaven,<BR>
Who like me can build a vessel,<BR>
From the fragments of the distaff,<BR>
From the splinters of the spindle."</P>
<P>Then he took the distaff-fragments,<BR>
Took the splinters of the spindle,<BR>
Hastened off the boat to fashion,<BR>
Hastened to an iron mountain,<BR>
There to join the many fragments.<BR>
Full of zeal be plies the hammer,<BR>
Swings the hammer and the hatchet;<BR>
Nothing daunted, builds the vessel,<BR>
Works one day and then a second,<BR>
Works with steady hand the third day;<BR>
On the evening of the third day,<BR>
Evil Hisi grasps the hatchet,<BR>
Lempo takes the crooked handle,<BR>
Turns aside the axe in falling,<BR>
Strikes the rocks and breaks to pieces;<BR>
From the rocks rebound the fragments,<BR>
Pierce the flesh of the magician,<BR>
Cut the knee of Wainamoinen.<BR>
Lempo guides the sharpened hatchet,<BR>
And the veins fell Hisi severs.<BR>
Quickly gushes forth a blood-stream,<BR>
And the stream is crimson-colored.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
The renowned and wise enchanter,<BR>
Thus outspeaks in measured accents:<BR>
"O thou keen and cruel hatchet,<BR>
O thou axe of sharpened metal,<BR>
Thou shouldst cut the trees to fragments,<BR>
Cut the pine-tree and the willow,<BR>
Cut the alder and the birch-tree,<BR>
Cut the juniper and aspen,<BR>
Shouldst not cut my knee to pieces,<BR>
Shouldst not tear my veins asunder."</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Thus begins his incantations,<BR>
Thus begins his magic singing,<BR>
Of the origin of evil;<BR>
Every word in perfect order,<BR>
Makes no effort to remember,<BR>
Sings the origin of iron,<BR>
That a bolt he well may fashion,<BR>
Thus prepare a look for surety,<BR>
For the wounds the axe has given,<BR>
That the hatchet has torn open.<BR>
But the stream flows like a brooklet,<BR>
Rushing like a maddened torrent,<BR>
Stains the herbs upon the meadows,<BR>
Scarcely is a bit of verdure<BR>
That the blood-stream does not cover<BR>
As it flows and rushes onward<BR>
From the knee of the magician,<BR>
From the veins of Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>Now the wise and ancient minstrel<BR>
Gathers lichens from the sandstone,<BR>
Picks them from the trunks of birches,<BR>
Gathers moss within the marshes,<BR>
Pulls the grasses from the meadows,<BR>
Thus to stop the crimson streamlet,<BR>
Thus to close the wounds laid open;<BR>
But his work is unsuccessful,<BR>
And the crimson stream flows onward.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Feeling pain and fearing languor,<BR>
Falls to weeping, heavy-hearted;<BR>
Quickly now his steed he hitches,<BR>
Hitches to the sledge of birch-wood,<BR>
Climbs with pain upon the cross-bench,<BR>
Strikes his steed in quick succession,<BR>
Snaps his whip above the racer,<BR>
And the steed flies onward swiftly;<BR>
Like the winds he sweeps the highway,<BR>
Till be nears a Northland village,<BR>
Where the way is triple-parted.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Takes the lowest of the highways,<BR>
Quickly nears a spacious cottage,<BR>
Quickly asks before the doorway:<BR>
"Is there any one here dwelling,<BR>
That can know the pain I suffer,<BR>
That can heal this wound of hatchet.<BR>
That can check this crimson streamlet?"</P>
<P>Sat a boy within a corner,<BR>
On a bench beside a baby,<BR>
And he answered thus the hero:<BR>
"There is no one in this dwelling<BR>
That can know the pain thou feelest,<BR>
That can heal the wounds of hatchet,<BR>
That can check the crimson streamlet;<BR>
Some one lives in yonder cottage,<BR>
That perchance can do thee service."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Whips his courser to a gallop,<BR>
Dashes on along the highway;<BR>
Only drives a little distance,<BR>
On the middle of the highways,<BR>
To a cabin on the road-side, <BR>
Asks one standing on the threshold,<BR>
Questions all through open windows,<BR>
These the words the hero uses:<BR>
"Is there no one in this cabin,<BR>
That can know the pain I suffer,<BR>
That can heal this wound of hatchet,<BR>
That can check this crimson streamlet?"</P>
<P>On the floor a witch was lying,<BR>
Near the fire-place lay the beldame,<BR>
Thus she spake to Wainamoinen,<BR>
Through her rattling teeth she answered.<BR>
"There is no one in this cabin<BR>
That can know the pain thou feelest,<BR>
That can heal the wounds of hatchets,<BR>
That can check the crimson streamlet;<BR>
Some one lives in yonder cottage,<BR>
That perchance can do thee service."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, nothing daunted,<BR>
Whips his racer to a gallop,<BR>
Dashes on along the highway;<BR>
Only drives a little distance,<BR>
On the upper of the highways,<BR>
Gallops to a humble cottage,<BR>
Asks one standing near the penthouse,<BR>
Sitting on the penthouse-doorsill:<BR>
"Is there no one in this cottage,<BR>
That can know the pain I suffer,<BR>
That can heal this wound of hatchet,<BR>
That can check this crimson streamlet?"</P>
<P>Near the fireplace sat an old man,<BR>
On the hearthstone sat the gray-beard,<BR>
Thus he answered Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Greater things have been accomplished,<BR>
Much more wondrous things effected,<BR>
Through but three words of the master;<BR>
Through the telling of the causes,<BR>
Streams and oceans have been tempered,<BR>
River cataracts been lessened,<BR>
Bays been made of promontories,<BR>
Islands raised from deep sea-bottoms."</P>
