<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">OSMOTAR THE BRIDE-ADVISER.</H1>
<P>Now the bride must be instructed,<BR>
Who will teach the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
Who instruct the Rainbow-daughter?<BR>
Osmotar, the wisdom-maiden,<BR>
Kalew's fair and lovely virgin,<BR>
Osmotar will give instructions<BR>
To the bride of Ilmarinen,<BR>
To the orphaned bride of Pohya,<BR>
Teach her how to live in pleasure,<BR>
How to live and reign in glory,<BR>
Win her second mother's praises,<BR>
Joyful in her husband's dwelling.</P>
<P>Osmotar in modest accents<BR>
Thus the anxious bride addresses;<BR>
"Maid of Beauty, lovely sister,<BR>
Tender plant of Louhi's gardens,<BR>
Hear thou what thy sister teaches,<BR>
Listen to her sage instructions:<BR>
Go thou hence, my much beloved,<BR>
Wander far away, my flower,<BR>
Travel on enwrapped in colors,<BR>
Glide away in silks and ribbons,<BR>
From this house renowned and ancient,<BR>
From thy father's halls and court-yards<BR>
Haste thee to thy husband's village,<BR>
Hasten to his mother's household;<BR>
Strange, the rooms in other dwellings,<BR>
Strange, the modes in other hamlets.</P>
<P>"Full of thought must be thy going,<BR>
And thy work be well considered,<BR>
Quite unlike thy home in Northland,<BR>
On the meadows of thy father,<BR>
On the high-lands of thy brother,<BR>
Singing through thy mother's fenlands,<BR>
Culling daisies with thy sister.<BR>
"When thou goest from thy father<BR>
Thou canst take whatever pleases,<BR>
Only three things leave behind thee:<BR>
Leave thy day-dreams to thy sister,<BR>
Leave thou kindness for thy mother,<BR>
To thy brother leave thy labors,<BR>
Take all else that thou desirest.<BR>
Throw away thine incantations,<BR>
Cast thy sighing to the pine-trees,<BR>
And thy maidenhood to zephyrs,<BR>
Thy rejoicings to the couches,<BR>
Cast thy trinkets to the children,<BR>
And thy leisure to the gray-beards,<BR>
Cast all pleasures to thy playmates,<BR>
Let them take them to the woodlands,<BR>
Bury them beneath the mountain.</P>
<P>"Thou must hence acquire new habits,<BR>
Must forget thy former customs,<BR>
Mother-love must be forsaken,<BR>
Thou must love thy husband's mother,<BR>
Lower must thy head be bended,<BR>
Kind words only must thou utter.</P>
<P>"Thou must hence acquire new habits,<BR>
Must forget thy former customs,<BR>
Father-love must be forsaken,<BR>
Thou must love thy husband's father,<BR>
Lower must thy head be bended,<BR>
Kind words only must thou utter.</P>
<P>"Thou must hence acquire new habits,<BR>
Must forget thy former customs,<BR>
Brother-love must be forsaken,<BR>
Thou must love thy husband's brother,<BR>
Lower must thy head be bended,<BR>
Kind words only must thou utter.</P>
<P>"Thou must hence acquire new habits<BR>
Must forget thy former customs,<BR>
Sister-love must be forsaken,<BR>
Thou must love thy husband's sister,<BR>
Lower must thy head be bended,<BR>
Kind words only must thou utter.</P>
<P>"Never in the course of ages,<BR>
Never while the moonlight glimmers,<BR>
Wickedly approach thy household,<BR>
Nor unworthily, thy servants,<BR>
Nor thy courts with indiscretion;<BR>
Let thy dwellings sing good manners,<BR>
And thy walls re-echo virtue.<BR>
After mind the hero searches.<BR>
And the best of men seek honor,<BR>
Seek for honesty and wisdom;<BR>
If thy home should be immoral,<BR>
If thine inmates fail in virtue,<BR>
Then thy gray-beards would be black-dogs<BR>
In sheep's clothing at thy firesides;<BR>
All thy women would be witches,<BR>
Wicked witches in thy chambers,<BR>
And thy brothers be as serpents<BR>
Crawling through thy husband's mansion;<BR>
All thy sisters would be famous<BR>
For their evil thoughts and conduct.</P>
<P>"Equal honors must be given<BR>
To thy husband's friends and kindred;<BR>
Lower must thy head be bended,<BR>
Than within thy mother's dwelling,<BR>
Than within thy father's guest-room,<BR>
When thou didst thy kindred honor.<BR>
Ever strive to give good counsel,<BR>
Wear a countenance of sunshine,<BR>
Bear a head upon thy shoulders<BR>
Filled with wise and ancient sayings;<BR>
Open bright thine eyes at morning<BR>
To behold the silver sunrise,<BR>
Sharpen well thine ears at evening,<BR>
Thus to hear the rooster crowing;<BR>
When he makes his second calling,<BR>
Straightway thou must rise from slumber,<BR>
Let the aged sleep in quiet;<BR>
Should the rooster fail to call thee,<BR>
Let the moonbeams touch thine eyelids,<BR>
Let the Great Bear be thy keeper<BR>
Often go thou and consult them,<BR>
Call upon the Moon for counsel,<BR>
Ask the Bear for ancient wisdom,<BR>
From the stars divine thy future;<BR>
When the Great Bear faces southward,<BR>
When his tail is pointing northward,<BR>
This is time to break with slumber,<BR>
Seek for fire within the ashes,<BR>
Place a spark upon the tinder,<BR>
Blow the fire through all the fuel.<BR>
If no spark is in the ashes,<BR>
Then go wake thy hero-husband,<BR>
Speak these words to him on waking:<BR>
'Give me fire, O my beloved,<BR>
Give a single spark, my husband,<BR>
Strike a little fire from flintstone,<BR>
Let it fall upon my tinder.'</P>
<P>"From the spark, O Bride of Beauty,<BR>
Light thy fires, and heat thine ovens,<BR>
In the holder, place the torch-light,<BR>
Find thy pathway to the stables,<BR>
There to fill the empty mangers;<BR>
If thy husband's cows be lowing,<BR>
If thy brother's steeds be neighing,<BR>
Then the cows await thy coming,<BR>
And the steeds for thee are calling,<BR>
Hasten, stooping through the hurdles,<BR>
Hasten through the yards and stables,<BR>
Feed thy husband's cows with pleasure,<BR>
Feed with care the gentle lambkins,<BR>
Give the cows the best of clover,<BR>
Hay, and barley, to the horses,<BR>
Feed the calves of lowing mothers,<BR>
Feed the fowl that fly to meet thee.</P>
<P>"Never rest upon the haymow,<BR>
Never sleep within the hurdles,<BR>
When the kine are fed and tended,<BR>
When the flocks have all been watered;<BR>
Hasten thence, my pretty matron,<BR>
Like the snow-flakes to thy dwelling,<BR>
There a crying babe awaits thee,<BR>
Weeping in his couch neglected,<BR>
Cannot speak and tell his troubles,<BR>
Speechless babe, and weeping infant,<BR>
Cannot say that he is hungry,<BR>
Whether pain or cold distresses,<BR>
Greets with joy his mother's footsteps.<BR>
Afterward repair in silence<BR>
To thy husband's rooms and presence,<BR>
Early visit thou his chambers,<BR>
In thy hand a golden pitcher,<BR>
On thine arm a broom of birch-wood,<BR>
In thy teeth a lighted taper,<BR>
And thyself the fourth in order.<BR>
Sweep thou then thy hero's dwelling,<BR>
Dust his benches and his tables,<BR>
Wash the flooring well with water.</P>
<P>"If the baby of thy sister<BR>
Play alone within his corner,<BR>
Show the little child attention,<BR>
Bathe his eyes and smoothe his ringlets,<BR>
Give the infant needed comforts;<BR>
Shouldst thou have no bread of barley,<BR>
In his hand adjust some trinket.</P>
<P>"Lastly, when the week has ended,<BR>
Give thy house a thorough cleansing,<BR>
Benches, tables, walls, and ceilings;<BR>
What of dust is on the windows,<BR>
Sweep away with broom of birch-twigs,<BR>
All thy rooms must first be sprinkled,<BR>
at the dust may not be scattered,<BR>
May not fill the halls and chambers.<BR>
Sweep the dust from every crevice,<BR>
Leave thou not a single atom;<BR>
Also sweep the chimney-corners,<BR>
Do not then forget the rafters,<BR>
Lest thy home should seem untidy,<BR>
Lest thy dwelling seem neglected.</P>
<P>"Hear, O maiden, what I tell thee,<BR>
Learn the tenor of my teaching:<BR>
Never dress in scanty raiment,<BR>
Let thy robes be plain and comely,<BR>
Ever wear the whitest linen,<BR>
On thy feet wear tidy fur-shoes,<BR>
For the glory of thy husband,<BR>
For the honor of thy hero.<BR>
Tend thou well the sacred sorb-tree,<BR>
Guard the mountain-ashes planted<BR>
In the court-yard, widely branching;<BR>
Beautiful the mountain-ashes,<BR>
Beautiful their leaves and flowers,<BR>
Still more beautiful the berries.<BR>
Thus the exiled one demonstrates<BR>
That she lives to please her husband,<BR>
Tries to make her hero happy.</P>
<P>"Like the mouse, have ears for hearing,<BR>
Like the hare, have feet for running,<BR>
Bend thy neck and turn thy visage<BR>
Like the juniper and aspen,<BR>
Thus to watch with care thy goings,<BR>
Thus to guard thy feet from stumbling,<BR>
That thou mayest walk in safety.</P>
<P>"When thy brother comes from plowing,<BR>
And thy father from his garners,<BR>
And thy husband from the woodlands,<BR>
From his chopping, thy beloved,<BR>
Give to each a water-basin,<BR>
Give to each a linen-towel,<BR>
Speak to each some pleasant greeting.</P>
<P>"When thy second mother hastens<BR>
To thy husband's home and kindred,<BR>
In her hand a corn-meal measure,<BR>
Haste thou to the court to meet her,<BR>
Happy-hearted, bow before her,<BR>
Take the measure from her fingers,<BR>
Happy, bear it to thy husband.</P>
<P>"If thou shouldst not see distinctly<BR>
What demands thy next attention,<BR>
Ask at once thy hero's mother:<BR>
'Second mother, my beloved,<BR>
Name the task to be accomplished<BR>
By thy willing second daughter,<BR>
Tell me how to best perform it.'</P>
<P>"This should be the mother's answer:<BR>
'This the manner of thy workings,<BR>
Thus thy daily work accomplish:<BR>
Stamp with diligence and courage,<BR>
Grind with will and great endurance,<BR>
Set the millstones well in order,<BR>
Fill the barley-pans with water,<BR>
Knead with strength the dough for baking,<BR>
Place the fagots on the fire-place,<BR>
That thy ovens may be heated,<BR>
Bake in love the honey-biscuit,<BR>
Bake the larger loaves of barley,<BR>
Rinse to cleanliness thy platters,<BR>
Polish well thy drinking-vessels.</P>
<P>"If thou hearest from the mother,<BR>
From the mother of thy husband,<BR>
That the cask for meal is empty,<BR>
Take the barley from the garners,<BR>
Hasten to the rooms for grinding.<BR>
When thou grindest in the chambers,<BR>
Do not sing in glee and joyance,<BR>
Turn the grinding-stones in silence,<BR>
To the mill give up thy singing,<BR>
Let the side-holes furnish music;<BR>
Do not sigh as if unhappy,<BR>
Do not groan as if in trouble,<BR>
Lest the father think thee weary,<BR>
Lest thy husband's mother fancy<BR>
That thy groans mean discontentment,<BR>
That thy sighing means displeasure.<BR>
Quickly sift the flour thou grindest,<BR>
Take it to the casks in buckets,<BR>
Bake thy hero's bread with pleasure,<BR>
Knead the dough with care and patience,<BR>
That thy biscuits may be worthy,<BR>
That the dough be light and airy.</P>
<P>"Shouldst thou see a bucket empty,<BR>
Take the bucket on thy shoulder,<BR>
On thine arm a silver-dipper,<BR>
Hasten off to fill with water<BR>
From the crystal river flowing;<BR>
Gracefully thy bucket carry,<BR>
Bear it firmly by the handles,<BR>
Hasten houseward like the zephyrs,<BR>
Hasten like the air of autumn;<BR>
Do not tarry near the streamlet,<BR>
At the waters do not linger,<BR>
That the father may not fancy,<BR>
Nor the ancient dame imagine,<BR>
That thou hast beheld thine image,<BR>
Hast admired thy form and features,<BR>
Hast admired thy grace and beauty<BR>
In the mirror of the fountain,<BR>
In the crystal streamlet's eddies.</P>
<P>"Shouldst thou journey to the woodlands,<BR>
There to gather aspen-fagots,<BR>
Do not go with noise and bustle,<BR>
Gather all thy sticks in silence,<BR>
Gather quietly the birch-wood,<BR>
That the father may not fancy,<BR>
And the mother not imagine,<BR>
That thy calling came from anger,<BR>
And thy noise from discontentment.</P>
<P>"If thou goest to the store-house<BR>
To obtain the flour of barley,<BR>
Do not tarry on thy journey,<BR>
On the threshold do not linger,<BR>
That the father may not fancy,<BR>
And the mother not imagine,<BR>
That the meal thou hast divided<BR>
With the women of the village.</P>
<P>"If thou goest to the river,<BR>
There to wash thy birchen platters,<BR>
There to cleanse thy pans and buckets,<BR>
Lest thy work be done in neatness,<BR>
Rinse the sides, and rinse the handles,<BR>
Rinse thy pitchers to perfection,<BR>
Spoons, and forks, and knives, and goblets,<BR>
Rinse with care thy cooking-vessels,<BR>
Closely watch the food-utensils,<BR>
That the dogs may not deface them,<BR>
That the kittens may not mar them,<BR>
That the eagles may not steal them,<BR>
That the children may not break them;<BR>
Many children in the village,<BR>
Many little heads and fingers,<BR>
That will need thy careful watching,<BR>
Lest they steal the things of value.</P>
<P>"When thou goest to thy bathing,<BR>
Have the brushes ready lying<BR>
In the bath-room clean and smokeless;<BR>
Do not, linger in the water,<BR>
At thy bathing do not tarry,<BR>
That the father may not fancy,<BR>
And the mother not imagine,<BR>
Thou art sleeping on the benches,<BR>
Rolling in the laps of comfort.</P>
<P>"From thy bath, when thou returnest,<BR>
To his bathing tempt the father,<BR>
Speak to him the words that follow:<BR>
'Father of my hero-husband,<BR>
Clean are all the bath-room benches,<BR>
Everything in perfect order;<BR>
Go and bathe for thine enjoyment,<BR>
Pour the water all-sufficient,<BR>
I will lend thee needed service.'</P>
<P>"When the time has come for spinning,<BR>
When the hours arrive for weaving,<BR>
Do not ask the help of others,<BR>
Look not in the stream for knowledge,<BR>
For advice ask not the servants,<BR>
Nor the spindle from the sisters,<BR>
Nor the weaving-comb from strangers.<BR>
Thou thyself must do the spinning,<BR>
With thine own hand ply the shuttle,<BR>
Loosely wind the skeins of wool-yarn,<BR>
Tightly wind the balls of flax-thread,<BR>
Wind them deftly in the shuttle<BR>
Fit the warp upon the rollers,<BR>
Beat the woof and warp together,<BR>
Swiftly ply the weaver's shuttle,<BR>
Weave good cloth for all thy vestments,<BR>
Weave of woolen, webs for dresses<BR>
From the finest wool of lambkins,<BR>
One thread only in thy weaving.</P>
<P>"Hear thou what I now advise thee:<BR>
Brew thy beer from early barley,<BR>
From the barley's new-grown kernels,<BR>
Brew it with the magic virtues,<BR>
Malt it with the sweets of honey,<BR>
Do not stir it with the birch-rod,<BR>
Stir it with thy skilful fingers;<BR>
When thou goest to the garners,<BR>
Do not let the seed bring evil,<BR>
Keep the dogs outside the brew-house,<BR>
Have no fear of wolves in hunger,<BR>
Nor the wild-beasts of the mountains,<BR>
When thou goest to thy brewing,<BR>
Shouldst thou wander forth at midnight.</P>
<P>"Should some stranger come to see thee,<BR>
Do not worry for his comfort;<BR>
Ever does the worthy household<BR>
Have provisions for the stranger,<BR>
Bits of meat, and bread, and biscuit,<BR>
Ample for the dinner-table;<BR>
Seat the stranger in thy dwelling,<BR>
Speak with him in friendly accents,<BR>
Entertain the guest with kindness,<BR>
While his dinner is preparing.<BR>
When the stranger leaves thy threshold,<BR>
When his farewell has been spoken,<BR>
Lead him only to the portals,<BR>
Do not step without the doorway,<BR>
That thy husband may not fancy,<BR>
And the mother not imagine,<BR>
Thou hast interest in strangers.</P>
<P>"Shouldst thou ever make a journey<BR>
To the centre of the village,<BR>
There to gain some needed object,<BR>
While thou speakest in the hamlet,<BR>
Let thy words be full of wisdom,<BR>
That thou shamest not thy kindred,<BR>
Nor disgrace thy husband's household.</P>
<P>"Village-maidens oft will ask thee,<BR>
Mothers of the hamlet question:<BR>
'Does thy husband's mother greet thee<BR>
As in childhood thou wert greeted,<BR>
In thy happy home in Pohya?'<BR>
Do not answer in negation,<BR>
Say that she has always given<BR>
Thee the best of her provisions,<BR>
Given thee the kindest greetings,<BR>
Though it be but once a season.</P>
<P>"Listen well to what I tell thee:<BR>
As thou goest from thy father<BR>
To thy husband's distant dwelling,<BR>
Thou must not forget thy mother,<BR>
Her that gave thee life and beauty,<BR>
Her that nurtured thee in childhood,<BR>
Many sleepless nights she nursed thee;<BR>
Often were her wants neglected,<BR>
Numberless the times she rocked thee;<BR>
Tender, true, and ever faithful,<BR>
Is the mother to her daughter.<BR>
She that can forget her mother,<BR>
Can neglect the one that nursed her,<BR>
Should not visit Mana's castle,<BR>
In the kingdom of Tuoni;<BR>
In Manala she would suffer,<BR>
Suffer frightful retribution,<BR>
Should her mother be forgotten;<BR>
Should her dear one be neglected,<BR>
Mana's daughters will torment her,<BR>
And Tuoni's sons revile her,<BR>
They will ask her much as follows:<BR>
'How couldst thou forget thy mother,<BR>
How neglect the one that nursed thee?<BR>
Great the pain thy mother suffered,<BR>
Great the trouble that thou gavest<BR>
When thy loving mother brought thee<BR>
Into life for good or evil,<BR>
When she gave thee earth-existence,<BR>
When she nursed thee but an infant,<BR>
When she fed thee in thy childhood,<BR>
When she taught thee what thou knowest,<BR>
Mana's punishments upon thee,<BR>
Since thy mother is forgotten!'"<BR>
On the floor a witch was sitting,<BR>
Near the fire a beggar-woman,<BR>
One that knew the ways of people,<BR>
These the words the woman uttered:<BR>
"Thus the crow calls in the winter:<BR>
'Would that I could be a singer,<BR>
And my voice be full of sweetness,<BR>
But, alas! my songs are worthless,<BR>
Cannot charm the weakest creature;<BR>
I must live without the singing<BR>
Leave the songs to the musicians,<BR>
Those that live in golden houses,<BR>
In the homes of the beloved;<BR>
Homeless therefore I must wander,<BR>
Like a beggar in the corn-fields,<BR>
And with none to do me honor.'</P>
<P>"Hear now, sister, what I tell thee,<BR>
Enter thou thy husband's dwelling,<BR>
Follow not his mind, nor fancies,<BR>
As my husband's mind I followed;<BR>
As a flower was I when budding,<BR>
Sprouting like a rose in spring-time,<BR>
Growing like a slender maiden,<BR>
Like the honey-gem of glory,<BR>
Like the playmates of my childhood,<BR>
Like the goslings of my father,<BR>
Like the blue-ducks of my mother,<BR>
Like my brother's water-younglings,<BR>
Like the bullfinch of my sister;<BR>
Grew I like the heather-flower,<BR>
Like the berry of the meadow,<BR>
Played upon the sandy sea-shore,<BR>
Rocked upon the fragrant upland,<BR>
Sang all day adown the valley,<BR>
Thrilled with song the hill and mountain,<BR>
Filled with mirth the glen and forest,<BR>
Lived and frolicked in the woodlands.</P>
<P>"Into traps are foxes driven<BR>
By the cruel pangs of hunger,<BR>
Into traps, the cunning ermine;<BR>
Thus are maidens wooed and wedded,<BR>
In their hunger for a husband.<BR>
Thus created is the virgin,<BR>
Thus intended is the daughter,<BR>
Subject to her hero-husband,<BR>
Subject also to his mother.</P>
<P>"Then to other fields I hastened,<BR>
Like a berry from the border,<BR>
Like a cranberry for roasting,<BR>
Like a strawberry for dinner;<BR>
All the elm-trees seemed to wound me,<BR>
All the aspens tried to cut me,<BR>
All the willows tried to seize me,<BR>
All the forest tried to slay me.<BR>
Thus I journeyed to my husband,<BR>
Thus I travelled to his dwelling,<BR>
Was conducted to his mother.<BR>
Then there were, as was reported,<BR>
Six compartments built of pine-wood,<BR>
Twelve the number of the chambers,<BR>
And the mansion filled with garrets,<BR>
Studding all the forest border,<BR>
Every by-way filled with flowers<BR>
Streamlets bordered fields of barley,<BR>
Filled with wheat and corn, the islands,<BR>
Grain in plenty in the garners,<BR>
Rye unthrashed in great abundance,<BR>
Countless sums of gold and silver,<BR>
Other treasures without number.<BR>
When my journey I had ended,<BR>
When my hand at last was given,<BR>
Six supports were in his cabin,<BR>
Seven poles as rails for fencing.<BR>
Filled with anger were the bushes,<BR>
All the glens disfavor showing,<BR>
All the walks were lined with trouble,<BR>
Evil-tempered were the forests,<BR>
Hundred words of evil import,<BR>
Hundred others of unkindness.<BR>
Did not let this bring me sorrow,<BR>
Long I sought to merit praises,<BR>
Long I hoped to find some favor,<BR>
Strove most earnestly for kindness;<BR>
When they led me to the cottage,<BR>
There I tried some chips to gather,<BR>
Knocked my head against the portals<BR>
Of my husband's lowly dwelling.</P>
<P>"At the door were eyes of strangers,<BR>
Sable eyes at the partition,<BR>
Green with envy in his cabin,<BR>
Evil heroes in the back-ground,<BR>
From each mouth the fire was streaming,<BR>
From each tongue the sparks out-flying,<BR>
Flying from my second father,<BR>
From his eyeballs of unkindness.<BR>
Did not let this bring me trouble,<BR>
Tried to live in peace and pleasure,<BR>
In the homestead of my husband<BR>
In humility I suffered,<BR>
Skipped about with feet of rabbit,<BR>
Flew along with steps of ermine,<BR>
Late I laid my head to slumber,<BR>
Early rose as if a servant,<BR>
Could not win a touch of kindness,<BR>
Could not merit love nor honor,<BR>
Though I had dislodged the mountains,<BR>
Though the rocks had I torn open.</P>
<P>"Then I turned the heavy millstone,<BR>
Ground the flour with care and trouble,<BR>
Ground the barley-grains in patience,<BR>
That the mother might be nourished,<BR>
That her fury-throat might swallow<BR>
What might please her taste and fancy,.<BR>
From her gold-enamelled platters,<BR>
From the corner of her table.</P>
<P>"As for me, the hapless daughter,<BR>
All my flour was from the siftings<BR>
On the table near the oven,<BR>
Ate I from the birchen ladle;<BR>
Oftentimes I brought the mosses<BR>
Gathered in the lowland meadows,<BR>
Baked them into loaves for eating;<BR>
Brought the water from the river,<BR>
Thirsty, sipped it from the dipper,<BR>
Ate of fish the worst in Northland,<BR>
Only smelts, and worthless swimmers,<BR>
Rocking in my boat of birch-bark<BR>
Never ate I fish or biscuit<BR>
From my second mother's fingers.</P>
<P>"Blades I gathered in the summers,<BR>
Twisted barley-stalks in winter,<BR>
Like the laborers of heroes,<BR>
Like the servants sold in bondage.<BR>
In the thresh-house of my husband,<BR>
Evermore to me was given<BR>
Flail the heaviest and longest,<BR>
And to me the longest lever,<BR>
On the shore the strongest beater,<BR>
And the largest rake in haying;<BR>
No one thought my burden heavy,<BR>
No one thought that I could suffer,<BR>
Though the best of heroes faltered,<BR>
And the strongest women weakened.</P>
<P>"Thus did I, a youthful housewife,<BR>
At the right time, all my duties,<BR>
Drenched myself in perspiration,<BR>
Hoped for better times to follow;<BR>
But I only rose to labor,<BR>
Knowing neither rest nor pleasure.<BR>
I was blamed by all the household,<BR>
With ungrateful tongues derided,<BR>
Now about my awkward manners,<BR>
Now about my reputation,<BR>
Censuring my name and station.<BR>
Words unkind were heaped upon me,<BR>
Fell like hail on me unhappy,<BR>
Like the frightful flash of lightning,<BR>
Like the heavy hail of spring-time.<BR>
I did not despair entirely,<BR>
Would have lived to labor longer<BR>
Underneath the tongue of malice,<BR>
But the old-one spoiled Lay temper,<BR>
Roused my deepest ire and hatred<BR>
Then my husband grew a wild-bear,<BR>
Grew a savage wolf of Hisi.</P>
<P>"Only then I turned to weeping,<BR>
And reflected in my chamber,<BR>
Thought of all my former pleasures<BR>
Of the happy days of childhood,<BR>
Of my father's joyful firesides,<BR>
Of my mother's peaceful cottage,<BR>
Then began I thus to murmur:<BR>
'Well thou knowest, ancient mother,<BR>
How to make thy sweet bud blossom,<BR>
How to train thy tender shootlet;<BR>
Did not know where to ingraft it,<BR>
Placed, alas! the little scion<BR>
In the very worst of places,<BR>
On an unproductive hillock,<BR>
In the hardest limb of cherry,<BR>
Where it could not grow and flourish,<BR>
There to waste its life, in weeping,<BR>
Hapless in her lasting sorrow.<BR>
Worthier had been my conduct<BR>
In the regions that are better,<BR>
In the court-yards that are wider,<BR>
In compartments that are larger,<BR>
Living with a loving husband,<BR>
Living with a stronger hero.<BR>
Shoe of birch-bark was my suitor,<BR>
Shoe of Laplanders, my husband;<BR>
Had the body of a raven,<BR>
Voice and visage like the jackdaw,<BR>
Mouth and claws were from the black-wolf,<BR>
The remainder from the wild-bear.<BR>
Had I known that mine affianced<BR>
Was a fount of pain and evil,<BR>
To the hill-side I had wandered,<BR>
Been a pine-tree on the highway,<BR>
Been a linden on the border,<BR>
Like the black-earth made my visage,<BR>
Grown a beard of ugly bristles,<BR>
Head of loam and eyes of lightning,<BR>
For my ears the knots of birches,<BR>
For my limbs the trunks of aspens.'</P>
<P>"This the manner of my singing<BR>
In the hearing of my husband,<BR>
Thus I sang my cares and murmurs<BR>
Thus my hero near the portals<BR>
Heard the wail of my displeasure,<BR>
Then he hastened to my chamber;<BR>
Straightway knew I by his footsteps,<BR>
Well concluded be was angry,<BR>
'Knew it by his steps implanted;<BR>
All the winds were still in slumber,<BR>
Yet his sable locks stood endwise,<BR>
Fluttered round his bead in fury,<BR>
While his horrid mouth stood open;<BR>
To and fro his eyes were rolling,<BR>
In one hand a branch of willow,<BR>
In the other, club of alder;<BR>
Struck at me with might of malice,<BR>
Aimed the cudgel at my forehead.</P>
<P>"When the evening had descended,<BR>
When my husband thought of slumber<BR>
Took he in his hand a whip-stalk,<BR>
With a whip-lash made of deer-skin,<BR>
Was not made for any other,<BR>
Only made for me unhappy.</P>
<P>"When at last I begged for mercy,<BR>
When I sought a place for resting,<BR>
By his side I courted slumber,<BR>
Merciless, my husband seized me,<BR>
Struck me with his arm of envy,<BR>
Beat me with the whip of torture,<BR>
Deer-skin-lash and stalk of birch-wood.<BR>
From his couch I leaped impulsive,<BR>
In the coldest night of winter,<BR>
But the husband fleetly followed,<BR>
Caught me at the outer portals,<BR>
Grasped me by my streaming tresses,<BR>
Tore my ringlets from my forehead,<BR>
Cast in curls upon the night-winds<BR>
To the freezing winds of winter.<BR>
What the aid that I could ask for,<BR>
Who could free me from my torment?<BR>
Made I shoes of magic metals,<BR>
Made the straps of steel and copper,<BR>
Waited long without the dwelling,<BR>
Long I listened at the portals,<BR>
Hoping he would end his ravings,<BR>
Hoping he would sink to slumber,<BR>
But he did not seek for resting,<BR>
Did not wish to still his fury.<BR>
Finally the cold benumbed me;<BR>
As an outcast from his cabin,<BR>
I was forced to walk and wander,<BR>
When I, freezing, well reflected,<BR>
This the substance of my thinking:<BR>
'I will not endure this torture,<BR>
Will not bear this thing forever,<BR>
Will not bear this cruel treatment,<BR>
Such contempt I will not suffer<BR>
In the wicked tribe of Hisi,<BR>
In this nest of evil Piru.'</P>
<P>"Then I said, 'Farewell forever!'<BR>
To my husband's home and kindred,<BR>
To my much-loved home and husband;<BR>
Started forth upon a journey<BR>
To my father's distant hamlet,<BR>
Over swamps and over snow-fields,<BR>
Wandered over towering mountains,<BR>
Over hills and through the valleys,<BR>
To my brother's welcome meadows,<BR>
To my sister's home and birthplace.</P>
<P>"There were rustling withered pine-trees.<BR>
Finely-feathered firs were fading,<BR>
Countless ravens there were cawing,<BR>
All the jackdaws harshly singing,<BR>
This the chorus of the ravens:<BR>
'Thou hast here a home no longer,<BR>
This is not the happy homestead<BR>
Of thy merry days of childhood.'</P>
<P>"Heeding not this woodland chorus,<BR>
Straight I journeyed to the dwelling<BR>
Of my childhood's friend and brother,<BR>
Where the portals spake in concord,<BR>
And the hills and valleys answered,<BR>
This their saddened song and echo:<BR>
'Wherefore dost thou journey hither,<BR>
Comest thou for joy or sorrow,<BR>
To thy father's old dominions?<BR>
Here unhappiness awaits thee,<BR>
Long departed is thy father,<BR>
Dead and gone to visit Ukko,<BR>
Dead and gone thy faithful mother,<BR>
And thy brother is a stranger,<BR>
While his wife is chill and heartless!'</P>
<P>"Heeding not these many warnings,<BR>
Straightway to my brother's cottage<BR>
Were my weary feet directed,<BR>
Laid my hand upon the door-latch<BR>
Of my brother's dismal cottage,<BR>
But the latch was cold and lifeless.<BR>
When I wandered to the chamber,<BR>
When I waited at the doorway,<BR>
There I saw the heartless hostess,<BR>
But she did not give me greeting,<BR>
Did not give her hand in welcome;<BR>
Proud, alas! was I unhappy,<BR>
Did not make the first advances,<BR>
Did not offer her my friendship,<BR>
And my hand I did not proffer;<BR>
Laid my hand upon the oven,<BR>
All its former warmth departed!<BR>
On the coal I laid my fingers,<BR>
All the latent heat had left it.<BR>
On the rest-bench lay my brother,<BR>
Lay outstretched before the fire-place,<BR>
Heaps of soot upon his shoulders,<BR>
Heaps of ashes on his forehead.<BR>
Thus the brother asked the stranger,<BR>
Questioned thus his guest politely:<BR>
'Tell me what thy name and station,<BR>
Whence thou comest o'er the waters!'<BR>
This the answer that I gave him:<BR>
Hast thou then forgot thy sister,<BR>
Does my brother not remember,<BR>
Not recall his mother's daughter<BR>
We are children of one mother,<BR>
Of one bird were we the fledgelings,<BR>
In one nest were hatched and nurtured.'</P>
<P>"Then the brother fell to weeping,<BR>
From his eyes great tear-drops flowing,<BR>
To his wife the brother whispered,<BR>
Whispered thus unto the housewife.<BR>
'Bring thou beer to give my sister,<BR>
Quench her thirst and cheer her spirits.'</P>
<P>"Full of envy, brought the sister<BR>
Only water filled with evil,<BR>
Water for the infant's eyelids,<BR>
Soap and water from the bath-room.</P>
<P>"To his wife the brother whispered,<BR>
Whispered thus unto the housewife:<BR>
'Bring thou salmon for my sister,<BR>
For my sister so long absent,<BR>
Thus to still her pangs of hunger.'</P>
<P>"Thereupon the wife obeying,<BR>
Brought, in envy, only cabbage<BR>
That the children had been eating,<BR>
And the house-dogs had been licking,<BR>
Leavings of the black-dog's breakfast.</P>
<P>"Then I left my brother's dwelling,<BR>
Hastened to the ancient homestead,<BR>
To my mother's home deserted;<BR>
Onward, onward did I wander,<BR>
Hastened onward by the cold-sea,<BR>
Dragged my body on in anguish,<BR>
To the cottage-doors of strangers,<BR>
To the unfamiliar portals,<BR>
For the care of the neglected,<BR>
For the needy of the village,<BR>
For the children poor and orphaned.</P>
<P>"There are many wicked people,<BR>
Many slanderers of women,<BR>
Many women evil-minded,<BR>
That malign their sex through envy.<BR>
Many they with lips of evil,<BR>
That belie the best of maidens,<BR>
Prove the innocent are guilty<BR>
Of the worst of misdemeanors,<BR>
Speak aloud in tones unceasing,<BR>
Speak, alas! with wicked motives,<BR>
Spread the follies of their neighbors<BR>
Through the tongues of self-pollution.<BR>
Very few, indeed, the people<BR>
That will feed the poor and hungry,<BR>
That will bid the stranger welcome;<BR>
Very few to treat her kindly,<BR>
Innocent, and lone, and needy,<BR>
Few to offer her a shelter<BR>
From the chilling storms of winter,<BR>
When her skirts with ice are stiffened,<BR>
Coats of ice her only raiment!</P>
<P>"Never in my days of childhood,<BR>
Never in my maiden life-time,<BR>
Never would believe the story<BR>
Though a hundred tongues had told<BR>
Though a thousand voices sang it,<BR>
That such evil things could happen,<BR>
That such misery could follow,<BR>
Such misfortune could befall one<BR>
Who has tried to do her duty,<BR>
Who has tried to live uprightly,<BR>
Tried to make her people happy."</P>
<P>Thus the young bride was instructed,<BR>
Beauteous Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Thus by Osmotar, the teacher.</P>
