<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WAINAMOINEN'S LAMENTATION.</H1>
<P>FAR and wide the tidings travelled,<BR>
Far away men heard the story<BR>
Of the flight and death of Aino,<BR>
Sister dear of Youkahainen,<BR>
Fairest daughter of creation.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, brave and truthful,<BR>
Straightway fell to bitter weeping,<BR>
Wept at morning, wept at evening,<BR>
Sleepless, wept the dreary night long,<BR>
That his Aino had departed,<BR>
That the maiden thus had vanished,<BR>
Thus had sunk upon the bottom<BR>
Of the blue-sea, deep and boundless.</P>
<P>Filled with grief, the ancient singer,<BR>
Wainamoinen of the Northland,<BR>
Heavy-hearted, sorely weeping,<BR>
Hastened to the restless waters,<BR>
This the suitor's prayer and question:<BR>
"Tell, Untamo, tell me, dreamer,<BR>
Tell me, Indolence, thy visions,<BR>
Where the water-gods may linger,<BR>
Where may rest Wellamo's maidens?"</P>
<P>Then Untamo, thus made answer,<BR>
Lazily he told his dreamings:<BR>
"Over there, the mermaid-dwellings,<BR>
Yonder live Wellamo's maidens,<BR>
On the headland robed in verdure,<BR>
On the forest-covered island,<BR>
In the deep, pellucid waters,<BR>
On the purple-colored sea-shore;<BR>
Yonder is the home or sea-maids,<BR>
There the maidens of Wellamo,<BR>
Live there in their sea-side chambers,<BR>
Rest within their water-caverns,<BR>
On the rocks of rainbow colors,<BR>
On the juttings of the sea-cliffs."</P>
<P>Straightway hastens Wainamoinen<BR>
To a boat-house on the sea-shore,<BR>
Looks with care upon the fish-hooks,<BR>
And the lines he well considers;<BR>
Lines, and hooks, and poles, arid fish-nets,<BR>
Places in a boat of copper,<BR>
Then begins he swiftly rowing<BR>
To the forest-covered island,<BR>
To the point enrobed In verdure,<BR>
To the purple-colored headland,<BR>
Where the sea-nymphs live and linger.<BR>
Hardly does he reach the island<BR>
Ere the minstrel starts to angle;<BR>
Far away he throws his fish-hook,<BR>
Trolls it quickly through the waters,<BR>
Turning on a copper swivel<BR>
Dangling from a silver fish-line,<BR>
Golden is the hook he uses.</P>
<P>Now he tries his silken fish-net,<BR>
Angles long, and angles longer,<BR>
Angles one day, then a second,<BR>
In the morning, in the evening,<BR>
Angles at the hour of noontide,<BR>
Many days and nights he angles,<BR>
Till at last, one sunny morning,<BR>
Strikes a fish of magic powers,<BR>
Plays like salmon on his fish-line,<BR>
Lashing waves across the waters,<BR>
Till at length the fish exhausted<BR>
Falls a victim to the angler,<BR>
Safely landed in the bottom<BR>
Of the hero's boat of copper.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, proudly viewing,<BR>
Speaks these words in wonder guessing:<BR>
"This the fairest of all sea-fish,<BR>
Never have I seen its equal,<BR>
Smoother surely than the salmon,<BR>
Brighter-spotted than the trout is,<BR>
Grayer than the pike of Suomi,<BR>
Has less fins than any female,<BR>
Not the fins of any male fish,<BR>
Not the stripes of sea-born maidens,<BR>
Not the belt of any mermaid,<BR>
Not the ears of any song-bird,<BR>
Somewhat like our Northland salmon<BR>
From the blue-sea's deepest caverns."</P>
<P>In his belt the ancient hero<BR>
Wore a knife insheathed with silver;<BR>
From its case he drew the fish-knife,<BR>
Thus to carve the fish in pieces,<BR>
Dress the nameless fish for roasting,<BR>
Make of it a dainty breakfast,<BR>
Make of it a meal at noon-day,<BR>
Make for him a toothsome supper,<BR>
Make the later meal at evening.</P>
<P>Straightway as the fish he touches,<BR>
Touches with his knife of silver,<BR>
Quick it leaps upon the waters,<BR>
Dives beneath the sea's smooth surface,<BR>
From the boat with copper bottom,<BR>
From the skiff of Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>In the waves at goodly distance,<BR>
Quickly from the sea it rises<BR>
On the sixth and seventh billows,<BR>
Lifts its head above the waters,<BR>
Out of reach of fishing-tackle,<BR>
Then addresses Wainamoinen,<BR>
Chiding thus the ancient hero:<BR>
"Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Do not think that I came hither<BR>
To be fished for as a salmon,<BR>
Only to be chopped in pieces,<BR>
Dressed and eaten like a whiting<BR>
Make for thee a dainty breakfast,<BR>
Make for thee a meal at midday,<BR>
Make for thee a toothsome supper,<BR>
Make the fourth meal of the Northland."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Wherefore didst thou then come hither,<BR>
If it be not for my dinner?"<BR>
Thus the nameless fish made answer:<BR>
"Hither have I come, O minstrel,<BR>
In thine arms to rest and linger,<BR>
And thyself to love and cherish,<BR>
At thy side a life-companion,<BR>
And thy wife to be forever;<BR>
Deck thy couch with snowy linen,<BR>
Smooth thy head upon the pillow,<BR>
Sweep thy rooms and make them cheery,<BR>
Keep thy dwelling-place in order,<BR>
Build a fire for thee when needed,<BR>
Bake for thee the honey-biscuit,<BR>
Fill thy cup with barley-water,<BR>
Do for thee whatever pleases.</P>
<P>"I am not a scaly sea-fish,<BR>
Not a trout of Northland rivers,<BR>
Not a whiting from the waters,<BR>
Not a salmon of the North-seas,<BR>
I, a young and merry maiden,<BR>
Friend and sister of the fishes,<BR>
Youkahainen's youngest sister,<BR>
I, the one that thou dost fish for,<BR>
I am Aino whom thou lovest.</P>
<P>"Once thou wert the wise-tongued hero,<BR>
Now the foolish Wainamoinen,<BR>
Scant of insight, scant of judgment,<BR>
Didst not know enough to keep me,<BR>
Cruel-hearted, bloody-handed,<BR>
Tried to kill me with thy fish-knife,<BR>
So to roast me for thy dinner;<BR>
I, a mermaid of Wellamo,<BR>
Once the fair and lovely Aino,<BR>
Sister dear of Youkahainen."</P>
<P>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Filled with sorrow, much regretting:<BR>
"Since thou'rt Youkahainen's sister,<BR>
Beauteous Aino of Pohyola,<BR>
Come to me again I pray thee!"</P>
<P>Thus the mermaid wisely answered;<BR>
Nevermore will Aino's spirit<BR>
Fly to thee and be ill-treated."</P>
<P>Quickly dived the water-maiden<BR>
From the surface of the billow<BR>
To the many-colored pebbles,<BR>
To the rainbow-tinted grottoes<BR>
Where the mermaids live and linger.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, not discouraged,<BR>
Thought afresh and well reflected,<BR>
How to live, and work, and win her;<BR>
Drew with care his silken fish-net,<BR>
To and fro through foam and billow,<BR>
Through the bays and winding channels,<BR>
Drew it through the placid waters,<BR>
Drew it through the salmon-dwellings,<BR>
Through the homes of water-maidens,<BR>
Through the waters of Wainola,<BR>
Through the blue-back of the ocean,<BR>
Through the lakes of distant Lapland,<BR>
Through the rivers of Youkola,<BR>
Through the seas of Kalevala,<BR>
Hoping thus to find his Aino.<BR>
Many were the fish be landed,<BR>
Every form of fish-like creatures,<BR>
But be did not catch the sea-maid,<BR>
Not Wellamo's water-maiden,<BR>
Fairest daughter of the Northland.</P>
<P>Finally the ancient minstrel,<BR>
Mind depressed, and heart discouraged,<BR>
Spake these words, immersed in sorrow:<BR>
"Fool am I, and great my folly,<BR>
Having neither wit nor judgment;<BR>
Surely once I had some knowledge,<BR>
Had some insight into wisdom,<BR>
Had at least a bit of instinct;<BR>
But my virtues all have left me<BR>
In these mournful days of evil,<BR>
Vanished with my youth and vigor,<BR>
Insight gone, and sense departed,<BR>
All my prudence gone to others!<BR>
Aino, whom I love and cherish,<BR>
All these years have sought to honor,<BR>
Aino, now Wellamo's maiden,<BR>
Promised friend of mine when needed,<BR>
Promised bride of mine forever,<BR>
Once I had within my power,<BR>
Caught her in Wellamo's grottoes,<BR>
Led her to my boat of copper,<BR>
With my fish-line made of silver;<BR>
But alas! I could not keep her,<BR>
Did not know that I had caught her<BR>
Till too late to woo and win her;<BR>
Let her slip between my fingers<BR>
To the home of water-maidens,<BR>
To the kingdom of Wellamo."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen then departed,<BR>
Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,<BR>
Straightway hastened to his country,<BR>
To his home in Kalevala,<BR>
Spake these words upon his journey:<BR>
"What has happened to the cuckoo,<BR>
Once the cuckoo bringing gladness,<BR>
In the morning, in the evening,<BR>
Often bringing joy at noontide?<BR>
What has stilled the cuckoo's singing,<BR>
What has changed the cuckoo's calling?<BR>
Sorrow must have stilled his singing,<BR>
And compassion changed his calling,<BR>
As I hear him sing no longer,<BR>
For my pleasure in the morning,<BR>
For my happiness at evening.<BR>
Never shall I learn the secret,<BR>
How to live and how to prosper,<BR>
How upon the earth to rest me,<BR>
How upon the seas to wander!<BR>
Only were my ancient mother<BR>
Living on the face of Northland,<BR>
Surely she would well advise me,<BR>
What my thought and what my action,<BR>
That this cup of grief might pass me,<BR>
That this sorrow might escape me,<BR>
And this darkened cloud pass over."</P>
<P>In the deep awoke his mother,<BR>
From her tomb she spake as follows:<BR>
"Only sleeping was thy mother,<BR>
Now awakes to give thee answer,<BR>
What thy thought and what thine action,<BR>
That this cup of grief may pass thee,<BR>
That this sorrow may escape thee,<BR>
And this darkened cloud pass over.<BR>
Hie thee straightway to the Northland,<BR>
Visit thou the Suomi daughters;<BR>
Thou wilt find them wise and lovely,<BR>
Far more beautiful than Aino,<BR>
Far more worthy of a husband,<BR>
Not such silly chatter-boxes,<BR>
As the fickle Lapland maidens.<BR>
Take for thee a life-companion,<BR>
From the honest homes of Suomi,<BR>
One of Northland's honest daughters;<BR>
She will charm thee with her sweetness,<BR>
Make thee happy through her goodness,<BR>
Form perfection, manners easy,<BR>
Every step and movement graceful,<BR>
Full of wit and good behavior,<BR>
Honor to thy home and kindred."</P>
