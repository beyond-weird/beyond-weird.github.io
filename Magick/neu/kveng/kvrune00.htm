<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE KALEVALA.</H1>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">PROEM.</H1>
<P>MASTERED by desire impulsive,<BR>
By a mighty inward urging,<BR>
I am ready now for singing,<BR>
Ready to begin the chanting<BR>
Of our nation's ancient folk-song<BR>
Handed down from by-gone ages.<BR>
In my mouth the words are melting,<BR>
From my lips the tones are gliding,<BR>
From my tongue they wish to hasten;<BR>
When my willing teeth are parted,<BR>
When my ready mouth is opened,<BR>
Songs of ancient wit and wisdom<BR>
Hasten from me not unwilling.</P>
<P>Golden friend, and dearest brother,<BR>
Brother dear of mine in childhood,<BR>
Come and sing with me the stories,<BR>
Come and chant with me the legends,<BR>
Legends of the times forgotten,<BR>
Since we now are here together,<BR>
Come together from our roamings.<BR>
Seldom do we come for singing,<BR>
Seldom to the one, the other,<BR>
O'er this cold and cruel country,<BR>
O'er the poor soil of the Northland.<BR>
Let us clasp our hands together<BR>
That we thus may best remember.<BR>
Join we now in merry singing,<BR>
Chant we now the oldest folk-lore,<BR>
That the dear ones all may hear them,<BR>
That the well-inclined may hear them,<BR>
Of this rising generation.<BR>
These are words in childhood taught me,<BR>
Songs preserved from distant ages,<BR>
Legends they that once were taken<BR>
From the belt of Wainamoinen,<BR>
From the forge of Ilmarinen,<BR>
From the sword of Kaukomieli,<BR>
From the bow of Youkahainen,<BR>
From the pastures of the Northland,<BR>
From the meads of Kalevala.<BR>
These my dear old father sang me<BR>
When at work with knife and hatchet<BR>
These my tender mother taught me<BR>
When she twirled the flying spindle,<BR>
When a child upon the matting<BR>
By her feet I rolled and tumbled.</P>
<P>Incantations were not wanting<BR>
Over Sampo and o'er Louhi,<BR>
Sampo growing old in singing,<BR>
Louhi ceasing her enchantment.<BR>
In the songs died wise Wipunen,<BR>
At the games died Lemminkainen.<BR>
There are many other legends,<BR>
Incantations that were taught me,<BR>
That I found along the wayside,<BR>
Gathered in the fragrant copses,<BR>
Blown me from the forest branches,<BR>
Culled among the plumes of pine-trees,<BR>
Scented from the vines and flowers,<BR>
Whispered to me as I followed<BR>
Flocks in land of honeyed meadows,<BR>
Over hillocks green and golden,<BR>
After sable-haired Murikki,<BR>
And the many-colored Kimmo.<BR>
Many runes the cold has told me,<BR>
Many lays the rain has brought me,<BR>
Other songs the winds have sung me;<BR>
Many birds from many forests,<BR>
Oft have sung me lays n concord<BR>
Waves of sea, and ocean billows,<BR>
Music from the many waters,<BR>
Music from the whole creation,<BR>
Oft have been my guide and master.<BR>
Sentences the trees created,<BR>
Rolled together into bundles,<BR>
Moved them to my ancient dwelling,<BR>
On the sledges to my cottage,<BR>
Tied them to my garret rafters,<BR>
Hung them on my dwelling-portals,<BR>
Laid them in a chest of boxes,<BR>
Boxes lined with shining copper.<BR>
Long they lay within my dwelling<BR>
Through the chilling winds of winter,<BR>
In my dwelling-place for ages.</P>
<P>Shall I bring these songs together<BR>
From the cold and frost collect them?<BR>
Shall I bring this nest of boxes,<BR>
Keepers of these golden legends,<BR>
To the table in my cabin,<BR>
Underneath the painted rafters,<BR>
In this house renowned and ancient?<BR>
Shall I now these boxes open,<BR>
Boxes filled with wondrous stories?<BR>
Shall I now the end unfasten<BR>
Of this ball of ancient wisdom,<BR>
These ancestral lays unravel?<BR>
Let me sing an old-time legend,<BR>
That shall echo forth the praises<BR>
Of the beer that I have tasted,<BR>
Of the sparkling beer of barley.<BR>
Bring to me a foaming goblet<BR>
Of the barley of my fathers,<BR>
Lest my singing grow too weary,<BR>
Singing from the water only.<BR>
Bring me too a cup of strong-beer,<BR>
It will add to our enchantment,<BR>
To the pleasure of the evening,<BR>
Northland's long and dreary evening,<BR>
For the beauty of the day-dawn,<BR>
For the pleasure of the morning,<BR>
The beginning of the new-day.</P>
<P>Often I have heard them chanting,<BR>
Often I have heard them singing,<BR>
That the nights come to us singly,<BR>
That the Moon beams on us singly,<BR>
That the Sun shines on us singly;<BR>
Singly also, Wainamoinen,<BR>
The renowned and wise enchanter,<BR>
Born from everlasting Ether<BR>
Of his mother, Ether's daughter.</P>
