<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">KULLERWOINEN'S VICTORY AND DEATH.</H1>
<P>KULLERWOINE.N, wicked wizard,<BR>
In his purple-colored stockings,<BR>
Now prepares himself for battle;<BR>
Grinds a long time on his broadsword,<BR>
Sharpens well his trusty weapon,<BR>
And his mother speaks as follows:<BR>
"Do not go, my son beloved,<BR>
Go not to the wars, my hero,<BR>
Struggle not with hostile spearsmen.<BR>
Whoso goes to war for nothing,<BR>
Undertakes a fearful combat,<BR>
Undertakes a fatal issue;<BR>
Those that war without a reason<BR>
Will be slaughtered for their folly,<BR>
Easy prey to bows and arrows.<BR>
Go thou with a goat to battle,<BR>
Shouldst thou go to fight the roebuck,<BR>
'Tis the goat that will be vanquished,<BR>
And the roebuck will be slaughtered;<BR>
With a frog thou'lt journey homeward,<BR>
Victor, with but little honor!"<BR>
These the words of Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"Shall not journey through the marshes,<BR>
Shall not sink upon the heather,<BR>
On the home-land of the raven,<BR>
Where the eagles scream at day-break.<BR>
When I yield my life forever,<BR>
Bravely will I fall in battle,<BR>
Fall upon the field of glory,<BR>
Beautiful to die in armor,<BR>
And the clang and clash of armies,<BR>
Beautiful the strife for conquest!<BR>
Thus Kullervo soon will hasten<BR>
To the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
To the realm of the departed,<BR>
Undeformed by wasting sickness."<BR>
This the answer of the mother:<BR>
"If thou diest in the conflict,<BR>
Who will stay to guard thy father,<BR>
Who will give thy sire protection?"<BR>
These the words of Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"Let him die upon the court-yard,<BR>
Sleeping out his life of sorrow!"</P>
<P>"Who then will protect thy mother,<BR>
Be her shield in times of danger?"</P>
<P>"Let her die within the stable,<BR>
Or the cabin where she lingers!"</P>
<P>"Who then will defend thy brother,<BR>
Give him aid in times of trouble?"</P>
<P>"Let him die within the forest,<BR>
Sleep his life away unheeded!"</P>
<P>"Who will comfort then thy sister,<BR>
Who will aid her in affliction?"</P>
<P>"Let her sink beneath the waters,<BR>
Perish in the crystal fountain,<BR>
Where the brook flows on in beauty,<BR>
Like a silver serpent winding<BR>
Through the valley to the ocean!"</P>
<P>Thereupon the wild Kullervo<BR>
Hastens from his home to battle,<BR>
To his father speaks, departing:<BR>
"Fare thou well, my aged father!<BR>
Wilt thou weep for me, thy hero,<BR>
When thou hearest I have perished,<BR>
Fallen from thy tribe forever,<BR>
Perished on the field of glory?"<BR>
Thus the father speaks in answer:<BR>
"I shall never mourn the downfall<BR>
Of my evil son, Kullervo;<BR>
Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<BR>
Shall beget a second hero<BR>
That will do me better service,<BR>
That will think and act in wisdom."<BR>
Kullerwoinen gives this answer:<BR>
"Neither shall I mourn thy downfall,<BR>
Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<BR>
I shall make a second father,<BR>
Make the head from loam and sandstone,<BR>
Make the eyes from swamp-land berries,<BR>
Make the beard from withered sea-grass,<BR>
Make the feet from roots of willow,<BR>
Make the form from birch-wood fungus."</P>
<P>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,<BR>
To his brother speaks as follows:<BR>
"Fare thou well, beloved brother!<BR>
Wilt thou weep for me departed,<BR>
Shouldst thou hear that I have perished,<BR>
Fallen on the field of battle?"<BR>
This the answer of the brother:<BR>
"I shall never mourn the downfall<BR>
Of my brother, Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<BR>
I shall find a second brother '<BR>
Find one worthier and wiser!"<BR>
This is Kullerwoinen's answer:<BR>
"Neither shall I mourn thy downfall,<BR>
Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<BR>
I shall form a second brother,<BR>
Make the head from dust and ashes,<BR>
Make the eyes from pearls of ocean,<BR>
Make the beard from withered verdure,<BR>
Make the form from pulp of birch-wood."<BR>
To his sister speaks Kullervo:<BR>
"Fare thou well, beloved sister!<BR>
Surely thou wilt mourn my downfall,<BR>
Weep for me when I have perished,<BR>
When thou hearest I have fallen<BR>
In the heat and din of battle,<BR>
Fallen from thy race forever!"<BR>
But the sister makes this answer:<BR>
"Never shall I mourn thy downfall,<BR>
Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<BR>
I shall seek a second brother,<BR>
Seek a brother, purer, better,<BR>
One that will not shame his sister!"<BR>
Kullerwoinen thus makes answer:<BR>
"Neither shall I mourn thee fallen,<BR>
Shall not weep when thou hast perished;<BR>
I shall form a second sister,<BR>
Make the head from whitened marble,<BR>
Make the eyes from golden moonbeams,<BR>
Make the tresses from the rainbow,<BR>
Make the ears from ocean-flowers,<BR>
And her form from gold and silver.</P>
<P>"Fare thou well, beloved mother,<BR>
Mother, beautiful and faithful!<BR>
Wilt thou weep when I have perished,<BR>
Fallen on the field of glory,<BR>
Fallen from thy race forever?"<BR>
Thus the mother speaks in answer:<BR>
"Canst not fathom love maternal,<BR>
Canst not smother her affection;<BR>
Bitterly I'll mourn thy downfall,<BR>
I would weep if thou shouldst perish,<BR>
Shouldst thou leave my race forever;<BR>
I would weep in court or cabin,<BR>
Sprinkle all these fields with tear-drops,<BR>
Weep great rivers to the ocean,<BR>
Weep to melt the snows of Northland,<BR>
Make the hillocks green with weeping,<BR>
Weep at morning, weep at evening,<BR>
Weep three years in bitter sorrow<BR>
O'er the death of Kullerwoinen!"</P>
<P>Thereupon the wicked wizard<BR>
Went rejoicing to the combat;<BR>
In delight to war he hastened<BR>
O'er the fields, and fens, and fallows,<BR>
Shouting loudly on the heather,<BR>
Singing o'er the hills and mountains,<BR>
Rushing through the glens and forests,<BR>
Blowing war upon his bugle.</P>
<P>Time had gone but little distance,<BR>
When a messenger appearing,<BR>
Spake these words to Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"Lo! thine aged sire has perished,<BR>
Fallen from thy race forever;<BR>
Hasten home and do him honor,<BR>
Lay him in the lap of Kalma."<BR>
Kullerwoinen inade this answer:<BR>
"Has my aged father perished,<BR>
There is home a sable stallion<BR>
That will take him to his slumber,<BR>
Lay him in the lap of Kalma."</P>
<P>Then Kullervo journeyed onward,<BR>
Calling war upon his bugle,<BR>
Till a messenger appearing,<BR>
Brought this word to Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"Lo! thy brother too has perished,<BR>
Dead he lies within the forest,<BR>
Manalainen's trumpet called him;<BR>
Home return and do him honor,<BR>
Lay him in the lap of Kalma."<BR>
Kullerwoinen thus replying:<BR>
"Has my hero-brother perished,<BR>
There is home a sable stallion<BR>
That will take him' to his slumber,<BR>
Lay him in the lap of Kalma."</P>
<P>Young Kullervo journeyed onward<BR>
Over vale and over mountain,<BR>
Playing on his reed of battle,<BR>
Till a messenger appearing<BR>
Brought the warrior these tidings:<BR>
"Lo! thy sister too has perished,<BR>
Perished in the crystal fountain,<BR>
Where the waters flow in beauty,<BR>
Like a silver serpent winding<BR>
Through the valley to the ocean;<BR>
Home return and do her honor,<BR>
Lay her in the lap of Kalma."<BR>
These the words of Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"Has my beauteous sister perished,<BR>
Fallen from my race forever,<BR>
There is home a sable filly<BR>
That will take her to her resting,<BR>
Lay her in the lap of Kalma."</P>
<P>Still Kullervo journeyed onward,<BR>
Through the fens he went rejoicing,<BR>
Sounding war upon his bugle,<BR>
Till a messenger appearing<BR>
Brought to him these words of sorrow:<BR>
"Lo! thy mother too has perished,<BR>
Died in anguish, broken-hearted;<BR>
Home return and do her honor,<BR>
Lay her in the lap of Kalma."<BR>
These the measures of Kullervo:<BR>
"Woe is me, my life hard-fated,<BR>
That my mother too has perished,<BR>
She that nursed me in my cradle,<BR>
Made my couch a golden cover,<BR>
Twirled for me the spool and spindle!<BR>
Lo! Kullervo was not present<BR>
When his mother's life departed;<BR>
May have died upon the mountains,<BR>
Perished there from cold and hunger.<BR>
Lave the dead form of my mother<BR>
In the crystal waters flowing;<BR>
Wrap her in the robes of ermine,<BR>
Tie her hands with silken ribbon,<BR>
Take her to the grave of ages,<BR>
Lay her in the lap of Kalma.<BR>
Bury her with songs of mourning,<BR>
Let the singers chant my sorrow;<BR>
Cannot leave the fields of battle<BR>
While Untamo goes unpunished,<BR>
Fell destroyer of my people."</P>
<P>Kullerwoinen journeyed onward,<BR>
Still rejoicing, to the combat,<BR>
Sang these songs in supplication:<BR>
"Ukko, mightiest of rulers,<BR>
Loan to me thy sword of battle,<BR>
Grant to me thy matchless weapon,<BR>
And against a thousand armies<BR>
I will war and ever conquer."</P>
<P>Ukko, gave the youth his broadsword,<BR>
Gave his blade of magic powers<BR>
To the wizard, Kullerwoinen.<BR>
Thus equipped, the mighty hero<BR>
Slew the people of Untamo,<BR>
Burned their villages to ashes;<BR>
Only left the stones and ovens,<BR>
And the chimneys of their hamlets.</P>
<P>Then the conqueror, Kullervo,<BR>
Turned his footsteps to his home-land,<BR>
To the cabin of his father '<BR>
To his ancient fields and forests.<BR>
Empty did he find the cabin,<BR>
And the forests were deserted;<BR>
No one came to give him greeting,<BR>
None to give the hand of welcome;<BR>
Laid his fingers on the oven,<BR>
But he found it cold and lifeless;<BR>
Then he knew to satisfaction<BR>
That his mother lived no longer;<BR>
Laid his hand upon the fire-place,<BR>
Cold and lifeless were the hearth-stones;<BR>
Then he knew to satisfaction<BR>
That his sister too had perished;<BR>
Then he sought the landing-places,<BR>
Found no boats upon the rollers;<BR>
Then he knew to satisfaction<BR>
That his brother too had perished;<BR>
Then he looked upon the fish-nets,<BR>
And he found them torn and tangled;<BR>
And he knew to satisfaction<BR>
That his father too had perished.</P>
<P>Bitterly he wept and murmured,<BR>
Wept one day, and then a second,<BR>
On the third day spake as follows:<BR>
"Faithful mother, fond and tender,<BR>
Why hast left me here to sorrow<BR>
In this wilderness of trouble?<BR>
But thou dost not hear my calling,<BR>
Though I sing in magic accents,<BR>
Though my tear-drops speak lamenting,<BR>
Though my heart bemoans thine absence.</P>
<P>From her grave awakes the mother,<BR>
To Kullervo speaks these measures:<BR>
"Thou has still the dog remaining,<BR>
He will lead thee to the forest;<BR>
Follow thou the faithful watcher,<BR>
Let him lead thee to the woodlands,<BR>
To the farthest woodland border,<BR>
To the caverns of the wood-nymphs;<BR>
Kullerwoinen's Victory and Death<BR>
There the forest maidens linger,<BR>
They will give thee food and shelter,<BR>
Give my hero joyful greetings."</P>
<P>Kullerwoinen, with his watch-dog,<BR>
Hastens onward through the forest,<BR>
Journeys on through fields and fallows;<BR>
Journeys but a little distance,<BR>
Till be comes upon the summit<BR>
Where he met his long-lost sister;<BR>
Finds the turf itself is weeping,<BR>
Finds the glen-wood filled with sorrow,<BR>
Finds the heather shedding tear-drops,<BR>
Weeping are the meadow-flowers,<BR>
O'er the ruin of his sister.</P>
<P>Kullerwoinen, wicked wizard,<BR>
Grasps the handle of his broadsword,<BR>
Asks the blade this simple question:<BR>
"Tell me, O my blade of honor,<BR>
Dost thou wish to drink my life-blood,<BR>
Drink the blood of Kullerwoinen?"</P>
<P>Thus his trusty sword makes answer,<BR>
Well divining his intentions:<BR>
Why should I not drink thy life-blood,<BR>
Blood of guilty Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Since I feast upon the worthy,<BR>
Drink the life-blood of the righteous?"</P>
<P>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,<BR>
Wicked wizard of the Northland,<BR>
Lifts the mighty sword of Ukko,<BR>
Bids adieu to earth and heaven;<BR>
Firmly thrusts the hilt in heather,<BR>
To his heart he points the weapon,<BR>
Throws his weight upon his broadsword,<BR>
Pouring out his wicked life-blood,<BR>
Ere be journeys to Manala.<BR>
Thus the wizard finds destruction,<BR>
This the end of Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Born in sin, and nursed in folly.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
As he hears the joyful tidings,<BR>
Learns the death of fell Kullervo,<BR>
Speaks these words of ancient wisdom:<BR>
"O, ye many unborn nations,<BR>
Never evil nurse your children,<BR>
Never give them out to strangers,<BR>
Never trust them to the foolish!<BR>
If the child is not well nurtured,<BR>
Is not rocked and led uprightly,<BR>
Though he grow to years of manhood,<BR>
Bear a strong and shapely body,<BR>
He will never know discretion,<BR>
Never eat. the bread of honor,<BR>
Never drink the cup of wisdom."</P>
