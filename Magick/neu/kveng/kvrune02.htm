<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WAINAMOINEN'S SOWING.</H1>
<P>THEN arose old Wainamoinen,<BR>
With his feet upon the island,<BR>
On the island washed by ocean,<BR>
Broad expanse devoid of verdure;<BR>
There remained he many summers,<BR>
There he lived as many winters,<BR>
On the island vast and vacant,<BR>
Well considered, long reflected,<BR>
Who for him should sow the island,<BR>
Who for him the seeds should scatter;<BR>
Thought at last of Pellerwoinen,<BR>
First-born of the plains and prairies,<BR>
When a slender boy, called Sampsa,<BR>
Who should sow the vacant island,<BR>
Who the forest seeds should scatter.<BR>
Pellerwoinen, thus consenting,<BR>
Sows with diligence the island,<BR>
Seeds upon the lands he scatters,<BR>
Seeds in every swamp and lowland,<BR>
Forest seeds upon the loose earth,<BR>
On the firm soil sows the acorns,<BR>
Fir-trees sows he on the mountains,<BR>
Pine-trees also on the hill-tops,<BR>
Many shrubs in every valley,<BR>
Birches sows he in the marshes,<BR>
In the loose soil sows the alders,<BR>
In the lowlands sows the lindens,<BR>
In the moist earth sows the willow,<BR>
Mountain-ash in virgin places,<BR>
On the banks of streams the hawthorn,<BR>
Junipers in hilly regions;<BR>
This the work of Pellerwoinen,<BR>
Slender Sampsa, in his childhood.<BR>
Soon the fertile seeds were sprouting,<BR>
Soon the forest trees were growing,<BR>
Soon appeared the tops of fir-trees,<BR>
And the pines were far outspreading;<BR>
Birches rose from all the marshes,<BR>
In the loose soil grew the alders,<BR>
In the mellow soil the lindens;<BR>
Junipers were also growing,<BR>
Junipers with clustered berries,<BR>
Berries on the hawthorn branches.</P>
<P>Now the hero, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Stands aloft to look about him,<BR>
How the Sampsa-seeds are growing,<BR>
How the crop of Pellerwoinen;<BR>
Sees the young trees thickly spreading,<BR>
Sees the forest rise in beauty;<BR>
But the oak-tree has not sprouted,<BR>
Tree of heaven is not growing,<BR>
Still within the acorn sleeping,<BR>
Its own happiness enjoying.<BR>
Then he waited three nights longer,<BR>
And as many days he waited,<BR>
Waited till a week had vanished,<BR>
Then again the work examined;<BR>
But the oak-tree was not growing,<BR>
Had not left her acorn-dwelling.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient hero,<BR>
Spies four maidens in the distance,<BR>
Water-brides, he spies a fifth-one,<BR>
On the soft and sandy sea-shore,<BR>
In the dewy grass and flowers,<BR>
On a point extending seaward,<BR>
Near the forests of the island.<BR>
Some were mowing, some were raking,<BR>
Raking what was mown together,<BR>
In a windrow on the meadow.</P>
<P>From the ocean rose a giant,<BR>
Mighty Tursas, tall and hardy,<BR>
Pressed compactly all the grasses,<BR>
That the maidens had been raking,<BR>
When a fire within them kindles,<BR>
And the flames shot up to heaven,<BR>
Till the windrows burned to ashes,<BR>
Only ashes now remaining<BR>
Of the grasses raked together.<BR>
In the ashes of the windrows,<BR>
Tender leaves the giant places,<BR>
In the leaves he plants an acorn,<BR>
From the acorn, quickly sprouting,<BR>
Grows the oak-tree, tall and stately,<BR>
From the ground enriched by ashes,<BR>
Newly raked by water-maidens;<BR>
Spread the oak-tree's many branches,<BR>
Rounds itself a broad corona,<BR>
Raises it above the storm-clouds;<BR>
Far it stretches out its branches,<BR>
Stops the white-clouds in their courses,<BR>
With its branches hides the sunlight,<BR>
With its many leaves, the moonbeams,<BR>
And the starlight dies in heaven.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
Thought awhile, and well considered,<BR>
How to kill the mighty oak-tree,<BR>
First created for his pleasure,<BR>
How to fell the tree majestic,<BR>
How to lop its hundred branches.<BR>
Sad the lives of man and hero,<BR>
Sad the homes of ocean-dwellers,<BR>
If the sun shines not upon them,<BR>
If the moonlight does not cheer them<BR>
Is there not some mighty hero,<BR>
Was there never born a giant,<BR>
That can fell the mighty oak-tree,<BR>
That can lop its hundred branches?<BR>
Wainamoinen, deeply thinking,<BR>
Spake these words soliloquizing:<BR>
"Kap&eacute;, daughter of the Ether,<BR>
Ancient mother of my being,<BR>
Luonnotar, my nurse and helper,<BR>
Loan to me the water-forces,<BR>
Great the powers of the waters;<BR>
Loan to me the strength of oceans,<BR>
To upset this mighty oak-tree,<BR>
To uproot this tree of evil,<BR>
That again may shine the sunlight,<BR>
That the moon once more may glimmer."</P>
<P>Straightway rose a form from oceans,<BR>
Rose a hero from the waters,<BR>
Nor belonged he to the largest,<BR>
Nor belonged he to the smallest,<BR>
Long was he as man's forefinger,<BR>
Taller than the hand of woman;<BR>
On his head a cap of copper,<BR>
Boots upon his feet were copper,<BR>
Gloves upon his hands were copper,<BR>
And its stripes were copper-colored,<BR>
Belt around him made of copper,<BR>
Hatchet in his belt was copper;<BR>
And the handle of his hatchet<BR>
Was as long as hand of woman,<BR>
Of a finger's breadth the blade was.<BR>
Then the trusty Wainamoinen<BR>
Thought awhile and well considered,<BR>
And his measures are as follow:<BR>
"Art thou, sir, divine or human?<BR>
Which of these thou only knowest;<BR>
Tell me what thy name and station.<BR>
Very like a man thou lookest,<BR>
Hast the bearing of a hero,<BR>
Though the length of man's first finger,<BR>
Scarce as tall as hoof of reindeer."</P>
<P>Then again spake Wainamoinen<BR>
To the form from out the ocean:<BR>
"Verily I think thee human,<BR>
Of the race of pigmy-heroes,<BR>
Might as well be dead or dying,<BR>
Fit for nothing but to perish."</P>
<P>Answered thus the pigmy-hero,<BR>
Spake the small one from the ocean<BR>
To the valiant Wainamoinen<BR>
"Truly am I god and hero,<BR>
From the tribes that rule the ocean;<BR>
Come I here to fell the oak-tree,<BR>
Lop its branches with my hatchet."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
Answers thus the sea-born hero:<BR>
"Never hast thou force sufficient,<BR>
Not to thee has strength been given,<BR>
To uproot this mighty oak-tree,<BR>
To upset this thing of evil,<BR>
Nor to lop its hundred branches."</P>
<P>Scarcely had he finished speaking,<BR>
Scarcely had he moved his eyelids,<BR>
Ere the pigmy full unfolding,<BR>
Quick becomes a mighty giant.<BR>
With one step he leaves the ocean,<BR>
Plants himself, a mighty hero,<BR>
On the forest-fields surrounding;<BR>
With his head the clouds he pierces,<BR>
To his knees his beard extending,<BR>
And his locks fall to his ankles;<BR>
Far apart appear his eyeballs,<BR>
Far apart his feet are stationed.<BR>
Farther still his mighty shoulders.<BR>
Now begins his axe to sharpen,<BR>
Quickly to an edge he whets it,<BR>
Using six hard blocks of sandstone,<BR>
And of softer whetstones, seven.<BR>
Straightway to the oak-tree turning,<BR>
Thither stalks the mighty giant,<BR>
In his raiment long and roomy,<BR>
Flapping in the winds of heaven;<BR>
With his second step he totters<BR>
On the land of darker color;<BR>
With his third stop firmly planted,<BR>
Reaches he the oak-tree's branches,<BR>
Strikes the trunk with sharpened hatchet,<BR>
With one mighty swing he strikes it,<BR>
With a second blow he cuts it;<BR>
As his blade descends the third time,<BR>
From his axe the sparks fly upward,<BR>
From the oak-tree fire outshooting;<BR>
Ere the axe descends a fourth time,<BR>
Yields the oak with hundred branches,<BR>
Shaking earth and heaven in falling.<BR>
Eastward far the trunk extending,<BR>
Far to westward flew the tree-tops,<BR>
To the South the leaves were scattered,<BR>
To the North its hundred branches.<BR>
Whosoe'er a branch has taken,<BR>
Has obtained eternal welfare;<BR>
Who secures himself a tree-top,<BR>
He has gained the master magic;<BR>
Who the foliage has gathered,<BR>
Has delight that never ceases.<BR>
Of the chips some had been scattered,<BR>
Scattered also many splinters,<BR>
On the blue back of the ocean,<BR>
Of the ocean smooth and mirrored,<BR>
Rocked there by the winds and waters,<BR>
Like a boat upon the billows;<BR>
Storm-winds blew them to the Northland,<BR>
Some the ocean currents carried.</P>
<P>Northland's fair and slender maiden,<BR>
Washing on the shore a head-dress,<BR>
Beating on the rocks her garments,<BR>
Rinsing there her silken raiment,<BR>
In the waters of Pohyola,<BR>
There beheld the chips and splinters,<BR>
Carried by the winds and waters.<BR>
In a bag the chips she gathered,<BR>
Took them to the ancient court-yard,<BR>
There to make enchanted arrows,<BR>
Arrows for the great magician,<BR>
There to shape them into weapons,<BR>
Weapons for the skilful archer,<BR>
Since the mighty oak has fallen,<BR>
Now has lost its hundred branches,<BR>
That the North may see the sunshine,<BR>
See the gentle gleam of moonlight,<BR>
That the clouds may keep their courses,<BR>
May extend the vault of heaven<BR>
Over every lake and river,<BR>
O'er the banks of every island.</P>
<P>Groves arose in varied beauty,<BR>
Beautifully grew the forests,<BR>
And again, the vines and flowers.<BR>
Birds again sang in the tree-tops,<BR>
Noisily the merry thrushes,<BR>
And the cuckoos in the birch-trees;<BR>
On the mountains grew the berries,<BR>
Golden flowers in the meadows,<BR>
And the herbs of many colors,<BR>
Many kinds of vegetation;<BR>
But the barley is not growing.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
Goes away and well considers,<BR>
By the borders of the waters,<BR>
On the ocean's sandy margin,<BR>
Finds six seeds of golden barley,<BR>
Even seven ripened kernels,<BR>
On the shore of upper Northland,<BR>
In the sand upon the sea-shore,<BR>
Hides them in his trusty pouches,<BR>
Fashioned from the skin of squirrel,<BR>
Some were made from skin of marten;<BR>
Hastens forth the seeds to scatter,<BR>
Quickly sows the barley kernels,<BR>
On the brinks of Kalew-waters,<BR>
On the Osma-hills and lowlands.</P>
<P>Hark! the titmouse wildly crying,<BR>
From the aspen, words as follow:<BR>
"Osma's barley will not flourish,<BR>
Not the barley of Wainola,<BR>
If the soil be not made ready,<BR>
If the forest be not levelled,<BR>
And the branches burned to ashes."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<BR>
Made himself an axe for chopping,<BR>
Then began to clear the forest,<BR>
Then began the trees to level,<BR>
Felled the trees of all descriptions,<BR>
Only left the birch-tree standing<BR>
For the birds a place of resting,<BR>
Where might sing the sweet-voiced cuckoo,<BR>
Sacred bird in sacred branches.<BR>
Down from heaven came the eagle,<BR>
Through the air be came a-flying,<BR>
That he might this thing consider;<BR>
And he spake the words that follow:<BR>
"Wherefore, ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Hast thou left the slender birch-tree,<BR>
Left the birch-tree only standing?"<BR>
Wainamoinen thus made answer:<BR>
"Therefore is the birch left standing,<BR>
That the birds may liest within it,<BR>
That the eagle there may rest him,<BR>
There may sing the sacred cuckoo."<BR>
Spake the eagle, thus replying:<BR>
Good indeed, thy hero-judgment,<BR>
That the birch-tree thou hast left us,<BR>
Left the sacred birch-tree standing,<BR>
As a resting-place for eagles,<BR>
And for birds of every feather,<BR>
Even I may rest upon it."<BR>
Quickly then this bird of heaven,<BR>
Kindled fire among the branches;<BR>
Soon the flames are fanned by north-winds,<BR>
And the east-winds lend their forces,<BR>
Burn the trees of all descriptions,<BR>
Burn them all to dust and ashes,<BR>
Only is the birch left standing.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<BR>
Brings his magic grains of barley,<BR>
Brings he forth his seven seed-grains,<BR>
Brings them from his trusty pouches,<BR>
Fashioned from the skin of squirrel,<BR>
Some were made from skin of marten.<BR>
Thence to sow his seeds he hastens,<BR>
Hastes the barley-grains to scatter,<BR>
Speaks unto himself these measures:<BR>
"I the seeds of life am sowing,<BR>
Sowing through my open fingers,<BR>
From the hand of my Creator,<BR>
In this soil enriched with ashes,<BR>
In this soil to sprout and flourish.<BR>
Ancient mother, thou that livest<BR>
Far below the earth and ocean,<BR>
Mother of the fields and forests,<BR>
Bring the rich soil to producing,<BR>
Bring the seed-grains to the sprouting,<BR>
That the barley well may flourish.<BR>
Never will the earth unaided,<BR>
Yield the ripe nutritious barley;<BR>
Never will her force be wanting,<BR>
If the givers give assistance,<BR>
If the givers grace the sowing,<BR>
Grace the daughters of creation.<BR>
Rise, O earth, from out thy slumber,<BR>
From the slumber-land of ages,<BR>
Let the barley-grains be sprouting,<BR>
Let the blades themselves be starting,<BR>
Let the verdant stalks be rising,<BR>
Let the ears themselves be growing,<BR>
And a hundredfold producing,<BR>
From my plowing and my sowing,<BR>
From my skilled and honest labor.<BR>
Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,<BR>
Thou O Father of the heavens,<BR>
Thou that livest high in Ether,<BR>
Curbest all the clouds of heaven,<BR>
Holdest in the air thy counsel,<BR>
Holdest in the clouds good counsel,<BR>
From the East dispatch a cloudlet,<BR>
From the North-east send a rain-cloud,<BR>
From the West another send us,<BR>
From the North-west, still another,<BR>
Quickly from the South a warm-cloud,<BR>
That the rain may fall from heaven,<BR>
That the clouds may drop their honey,<BR>
That the ears may fill and ripen,<BR>
That the barley-fields may rustle."</P>
<P>Thereupon benignant Ukko,<BR>
Ukko, father of the heavens,<BR>
Held his counsel in the cloud-space,<BR>
Held good counsel in the Ether;<BR>
From the East, he sent a cloudlet,<BR>
From the North-east, sent a rain-cloud,<BR>
From the West another sent he,<BR>
From the North-west, still another,<BR>
Quickly from the South a warm-cloud;<BR>
Joined in seams the clouds together,<BR>
Sewed together all their edges,<BR>
Grasped the cloud, and hurled it earthward.<BR>
Quick the rain-cloud drops her honey,<BR>
Quick the rain-drops fall from heaven,<BR>
That the ears may quickly ripen,<BR>
That the barley crop may rustle.<BR>
Straightway grow the seeds of barley,<BR>
From the germ the blade unfolding,<BR>
Richly colored ears arising,<BR>
From the rich soil of the fallow,<BR>
From the work of Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>Here a few days pass unnoted<BR>
And as many nights fly over.<BR>
When the seventh day had journeyed,<BR>
On the morning of the eighth day,<BR>
Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<BR>
Went to view his crop of barley,<BR>
How his plowing, how his sowing,<BR>
How his labors were resulting;<BR>
Found his crop of barley growing,<BR>
Found the blades were triple-knotted,<BR>
And the ears he found six-sided.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
Turned his face, and looked about him,<BR>
Lo! there comes a spring-time cuckoo,<BR>
Spying out the slender birch-tree,<BR>
Rests upon it, sweetly singing:<BR>
"Wherefore is the silver birch-tree<BR>
Left unharmed of all the forest? "<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Therefore I have left the birch-tree,<BR>
Left the birch-tree only growing,<BR>
Home for thee for joyful singing.<BR>
Call thou here, O sweet-voiced cuckoo,<BR>
Sing thou here from throat of velvet,<BR>
Sing thou here with voice of silver,<BR>
Sing the cuckoo's golden flute-notes;<BR>
Call at morning, call at evening,<BR>
Call within the hour of noontide,<BR>
For the better growth of forests,<BR>
For the ripening of the barley,<BR>
For the richness of, the Northland,<BR>
For the joy of Kalevala."</P>
