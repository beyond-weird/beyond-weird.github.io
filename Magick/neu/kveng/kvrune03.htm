<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WAINAMOINEN AND YOUKAHAINEN.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Passed his years in full contentment,<BR>
On the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
On the plains of Kalevala,<BR>
Singing ever wondrous legends,<BR>
Songs of ancient wit and wisdom,<BR>
Chanting one day, then a second,<BR>
Singing in the dusk of evening,<BR>
Singing till the dawn of morning,<BR>
Now the tales of old-time heroes,<BR>
Tales of ages long forgotten,<BR>
Now the legends of creation,<BR>
Once familiar to the children,<BR>
By our children sung no longer,<BR>
Sung in part by many heroes,<BR>
In these mournful days of evil,<BR>
Evil days our race befallen.<BR>
Far and wide the story travelled,<BR>
Far away men spread the knowledge<BR>
Of the chanting of the hero,<BR>
Of the song of Wainamoinen;<BR>
To the South were heard the echoes,<BR>
All of Northland heard the story.</P>
<P>Far away in dismal Northland,<BR>
Lived the singer, Youkahainen,<BR>
Lapland's young and reckless minstrel,<BR>
Once upon a time when feasting,<BR>
Dining with his friends and fellows,<BR>
Came upon his ears the story<BR>
That there lived a sweeter singer,<BR>
On the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
On the plains of Kalevala,<BR>
Better skilled in chanting legends,<BR>
Better skilled than Youkahainen,<BR>
Better than the one that taught him.</P>
<P>Straightway then the bard grew angry,<BR>
Envy rose within his bosom,<BR>
Envy of this Wainamoinen,<BR>
Famed to be a sweeter singer;<BR>
Hastes he angry to his mother,<BR>
To his mother, full of wisdom,<BR>
Vows that he will southward hasten,<BR>
Hie him southward and betake him<BR>
To the dwellings of Wainola,<BR>
To the cabins of the Northland,<BR>
There as bard to vie in battle,<BR>
With the famous Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>"Nay," replies the anxious father,<BR>
"Do not go to Kalevala."</P>
<P>"Nay," replies the fearful mother,<BR>
"Go not hence to Wainamoinen,<BR>
There with him to offer battle;<BR>
He will charm thee with his singing<BR>
Will bewitch thee in his anger,<BR>
He will drive thee back dishonored,<BR>
Sink thee in the fatal snow-drift,<BR>
Turn to ice thy pliant fingers,<BR>
Turn to ice thy feet and ankles."<BR>
These the words of Youkahainen:<BR>
Good the judgement of a father,<BR>
Better still, a mother's counsel,<BR>
Best of all one's own decision.<BR>
I will go and face the minstrel,<BR>
Challenge him to sing in contest,<BR>
Challenge him as bard to battle,<BR>
Sing to him my sweet-toned measures,<BR>
Chant to him my oldest legends,<BR>
Chant to him my garnered wisdom,<BR>
That this best of boasted singers,<BR>
That this famous bard of Suomi,<BR>
Shall be worsted in the contest,<BR>
Shall become a hapless minstrel;<BR>
By my songs shall I transform him,<BR>
That his feet shall be as flint-stone,<BR>
And as oak his nether raiment;<BR>
And this famous, best of singers,<BR>
Thus bewitched, shall carry ever,<BR>
In his heart a stony burden,<BR>
On his shoulder bow of marble,<BR>
On his hand a flint-stone gauntlet,<BR>
On his brow a stony visor."</P>
<P>Then the wizard, Youkahainen,<BR>
Heeding not advice paternal,<BR>
Heeding not his mother's counsel,<BR>
Leads his courser from his stable,<BR>
Fire outstreaming from his nostrils,<BR>
From his hoofs, the sparks outshooting,<BR>
Hitches to his sledge, the fleet-foot,<BR>
To his golden sledge, the courser,<BR>
Mounts impetuous his snow-sledge,<BR>
Leaps upon the hindmost cross-bench,<BR>
Strikes his courser with his birch-whip,<BR>
With his birch-whip, pearl-enamelled.<BR>
Instantly the prancing racer<BR>
Springs away upon his journey;<BR>
On he, restless, plunges northward,<BR>
All day long be onward gallops,<BR>
All the next day, onward, onward,<BR>
So the third from morn till evening,<BR>
Till the third day twilight brings him<BR>
To the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
To the plains of Kalevala.</P>
<P>As it happened, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
Rode that sunset on the highway,<BR>
Silently for pleasure driving<BR>
Down Wainola's peaceful meadows,<BR>
O'er the plains of Kalevala.</P>
<P>Youkahainen, young and fiery,<BR>
Urging still his foaming courser,<BR>
Dashes down upon the singer,<BR>
Does not turn aside in meeting,<BR>
Meeting thus in full collision;<BR>
Shafts are driven tight together,<BR>
Hames and collars wedged and tangled,<BR>
Tangled are the reins and traces.<BR>
Thus perforce they make a stand-still,<BR>
Thus remain and well consider;<BR>
Water drips from hame and collar,<BR>
Vapors rise from both their horses.<BR>
Speaks the minstrel, Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Who art thou, and whence? Thou comest<BR>
Driving like a stupid stripling,<BR>
Wainamoinen and Youkahainen.<BR>
Careless, dashing down upon me.<BR>
Thou hast ruined shafts and traces;<BR>
And the collar of my racer<BR>
Thou hast shattered into ruin,<BR>
And my golden sleigh is broken,<BR>
Box and runners dashed to pieces."</P>
<P>Youkahainen then make answer,<BR>
Spake at last the words that follow:<BR>
"I am youthful Youkahainen,<BR>
But make answer first, who thou art,<BR>
Whence thou comest, where thou goest,<BR>
From what lowly tribe descended?"</P>
<P>Wainamolinen, wise and ancient,<BR>
Answered thus the youthful minstrel:<BR>
"If thou art but Youkahainen,<BR>
Thou shouldst give me all the highway;<BR>
I am many years thy senior."</P>
<P>Then the boastful Youkahainen<BR>
Spake again to Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Young or ancient, little matter,<BR>
Little consequence the age is;<BR>
He that higher stands in wisdom,<BR>
He whose knowledge is the greater,<BR>
He that is the sweeter singer,<BR>
He alone shall keep the highway,<BR>
And the other take the roadside.<BR>
Art thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Famous sorcerer and minstrel?<BR>
Let us then begin our singing,<BR>
Let us sing our ancient legends,<BR>
Let us chant our garnered wisdom,<BR>
That the one may hear the other,<BR>
That the one may judge the other,<BR>
In a war of wizard sayings."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<BR>
Thus replied in modest accents:<BR>
"What I know is very little,<BR>
Hardly is it worth the singing,<BR>
Neither is my singing wondrous:<BR>
All my days I have resided<BR>
In the cold and dreary Northland,<BR>
In a desert land enchanted,<BR>
In my cottage home for ayes;<BR>
All the songs that I have gathered,<BR>
Are the cuckoo's simple measures,<BR>
Some of these I may remember;<BR>
But since thou perforce demandest,<BR>
I accept thy boastful challenge.<BR>
Tell me now, my golden youngster,<BR>
What thou knowest more than others,<BR>
Open now thy store of wisdom."</P>
<P>Thus made answer Youkahainen,<BR>
Lapland's young and fiery minstrel:<BR>
"Know I many bits of learning<BR>
This I know in perfect clearness:<BR>
Every roof must have a chimney,<BR>
Every fire-place have a hearth-stone;<BR>
Lives of seal are free and merry,<BR>
Merry is the life of walrus,<BR>
Feeding on incautious salmon,<BR>
Daily eating perch and whiting;<BR>
Whitings live in quiet shallows,<BR>
Salmon love the level bottoms;<BR>
Spawns the pike in coldest weather,<BR>
And defies the storms of winter.</P>
<P>Slowly perches swim in Autumn,<BR>
Wry-backed, hunting deeper water,<BR>
Spawn in shallows in the summer,<BR>
Bounding on the shore of ocean.<BR>
Should this wisdom seem too little,<BR>
I can tell thee other matters,<BR>
Sing thee other wizard sayings:<BR>
All the Northmen plow with reindeer,<BR>
Mother-horses plow the Southland,<BR>
Inner Lapland plows with oxen;<BR>
All the trees on Pisa-mountain,<BR>
Know I well in all their grandeur;<BR>
On the Horna-rock are fir-trees,<BR>
Fir-trees growing tall and slender;<BR>
Slender grow the trees on mountains.<BR>
Three, the water-falls in number,<BR>
Three in number, inland oceans,<BR>
Three in number, lofty mountains,<BR>
Shooting to the vault of heaven.<BR>
Hallapyora's near to Yaemen,<BR>
Katrakoski in Karyala;<BR>
Imatra, the falling water,<BR>
Tumbles, roaring, into Wuoksi."</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainimoinen:<BR>
"Women's tales and children's wisdom<BR>
Do not please a bearded hero,<BR>
Hero, old enough for wedlock;<BR>
Tell the story of creation,<BR>
Tell me of the world's beginning,<BR>
Tell me of the creatures in it,<BR>
And philosophize a little."</P>
<P>Then the youthful Youkahainen<BR>
Thus replied to Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Know I well the titmouse-fountains,<BR>
Pretty birdling is the titmouse;<BR>
And the viper, green, a serpent;<BR>
Whitings live in brackish waters;<BR>
Perches swim in every river;<BR>
Iron rusts, and rusting weakens;<BR>
Bitter is the taste of umber;<BR>
Boiling water is malicious;<BR>
Fire is ever full of danger;<BR>
First physician, the Creator;<BR>
Remedy the oldest, water;<BR>
Magic is the child of sea-foam;<BR>
God the first and best adviser;<BR>
Waters gush from every mountain;<BR>
Fire descended first from heaven;<BR>
Iron from the rust was fashioned;<BR>
Copper from the rocks created;<BR>
Marshes are of lands the oldest;<BR>
First of all the trees, the willow;<BR>
Fir-trees were the first of houses;<BR>
Hollowed stones the first of kettles."</P>
<P>Now the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Thus addresses Youkahainen:<BR>
"Canst thou give me now some wisdom,<BR>
Is this nonsense all thou knowest?"<BR>
Youkahainen thus made answer:<BR>
"I can tell thee still a trifle,<BR>
Tell thee of the times primeval,<BR>
When I plowed the salt-sea's bosom,<BR>
When I raked the sea-girt islands,<BR>
When I dug the salmon-grottoes,<BR>
Hollowed out the deepest caverns,<BR>
When I all the lakes created,<BR>
When I heaped the mountains round them,<BR>
When I piled the rocks about them.<BR>
I was present as a hero,<BR>
Sixth of wise and ancient heroes,<BR>
Seventh of all primeval heroes,<BR>
When the heavens were created,<BR>
When were formed the ether-spaces,<BR>
When the sky was crystal-pillared,<BR>
When was arched the beauteous rainbow,<BR>
When the Moon was placed in orbit,<BR>
When the silver Sun was planted,<BR>
When the Bear was firmly stationed,<BR>
And with stars the heavens were sprinkled."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Thou art surely prince of liars,<BR>
Lord of all the host of liars;<BR>
Never wert thou in existence,<BR>
Surely wert thou never present,<BR>
When was plowed the salt-sea's bosom,<BR>
When were raked the sea-girt islands,<BR>
When were dug the salmon-grottoes,<BR>
When were hollowed out the caverns,<BR>
When the lakes were all created,<BR>
When were heaped the mountains round them,<BR>
When the rocks were piled about them.<BR>
Thou wert never seen or heard of<BR>
When the earth was first created,<BR>
When were made the ether-spaces,<BR>
When the air was crystal-pillared,<BR>
When the Moon was placed in orbit,<BR>
When the silver Sun was planted,<BR>
When the Bear was firmly stationed,<BR>
When the skies with stars were sprinkled."</P>
<P>Then in anger Youkahainen<BR>
Answered ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Then, sir, since I fail in wisdom,<BR>
With the sword I offer battle;<BR>
Come thou, famous bard and minstrel,<BR>
Thou the ancient wonder-singer,<BR>
Let us try our strength with broadswords,<BR>
let our blades be fully tested."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Not thy sword and not thy wisdom,<BR>
Not thy prudence, nor thy cunning,<BR>
Do I fear a single moment.<BR>
Let who may accept thy challenge,<BR>
Not with thee, a puny braggart,<BR>
Not with one so vain and paltry,<BR>
Will I ever measure broadswords."</P>
<P>Then the youthful Youkahainen,<BR>
Mouth awry and visage sneering,<BR>
Shook his golden locks and answered:<BR>
"Whoso fears his blade to measure,<BR>
Fears to test his strength at broadswords,<BR>
Into wild-boar of the forest,<BR>
Swine at heart and swine in visage,<BR>
Singing I will thus transform him;<BR>
I will hurl such hero-cowards,<BR>
This one hither, that one thither,<BR>
Stamp him in the mire and bedding,<BR>
In the rubbish of the stable."</P>
<P>Angry then grew Wainamoinen,<BR>
Wrathful waxed, and fiercely frowning,<BR>
Self-composed he broke his silence,<BR>
And began his wondrous singing.<BR>
Sang he not the tales of childhood,<BR>
Children's nonsense, wit of women,<BR>
Sang he rather bearded heroes,<BR>
That the children never heard of,<BR>
That the boys and maidens knew not<BR>
Known but half by bride and bridegroom,<BR>
Known in part by many heroes,<BR>
In these mournful days of evil,<BR>
Evil times our race befallen.<BR>
Grandly sang wise Wainamoinen,<BR>
Till the copper-bearing mountains,<BR>
And the flinty rocks and ledges<BR>
Heard his magic tones and trembled;<BR>
Mountain cliffs were torn to pieces,<BR>
All the ocean heaved and tumbled;<BR>
And the distant hills re-echoed.<BR>
Lo! the boastful Youkahainen<BR>
Is transfixed in silent wonder,<BR>
And his sledge with golden trimmings<BR>
Floats like brushwood on the billows;<BR>
Sings his braces into reed-grass,<BR>
Sings his reins to twigs of willow,<BR>
And to shrubs his golden cross-bench.<BR>
Lo! his birch-whip, pearl-enameled,<BR>
Floats a reed upon the border;<BR>
Lo! his steed with golden forehead,<BR>
Stands a statue on the waters;<BR>
Hames and traces are as fir-boughs,<BR>
And his collar, straw and sea-grass.<BR>
Still the minstrel sings enchantment,<BR>
Sings his sword with golden handle,<BR>
Sings it into gleam of lightning,<BR>
Hangs it in the sky above him;<BR>
Sings his cross-bow, gaily painted,<BR>
To a rainbow o'er the ocean;<BR>
Sings his quick and feathered arrows<BR>
Into hawks and screaming eagles;<BR>
Sings his dog with bended muzzle,<BR>
Into block of stone beside him;<BR>
Sings his cap from off his forehead,<BR>
Sings it into wreaths of vapor;<BR>
From his hands he sings his gauntlets<BR>
Into rushes on the waters;<BR>
Sings his vesture, purple-colored,<BR>
Into white clouds in the heavens;<BR>
Sings his girdle, set with jewels,<BR>
Into twinkling stars around him;<BR>
And alas! for Youkahainen,<BR>
Sings him into deeps of quick-sand;<BR>
Ever deeper, deeper, deeper,<BR>
In his torture, sinks the wizard,<BR>
To his belt in mud and water.<BR>
Now it was that Youkahainen<BR>
Comprehended but too clearly<BR>
What his folly, what the end was,<BR>
Of the journey he had ventured,<BR>
Vainly he had undertaken<BR>
For the glory of a contest<BR>
With the grand, old Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>When at last young Youkahainen,<BR>
Pohyola's old and sorry stripling,<BR>
Strives his best to move his right foot,<BR>
But alas! the foot obeys not;<BR>
When he strives to move his left foot,<BR>
Lo! he finds it turned to flint-stone.</P>
<P>Thereupon sad Youkahainen,<BR>
In the deeps of desperation,<BR>
And in earnest supplication,<BR>
Thus addresses Wainamoinen:<BR>
"O thou wise and worthy minstrel,<BR>
Thou the only true, magician,<BR>
Cease I pray thee thine enchantment,.<BR>
Only turn away thy magic,<BR>
Let me leave this slough of horror,<BR>
Loose me from this stony prison,<BR>
Free me from this killing torment,<BR>
I will pay a golden ransom."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"What the ransom thou wilt give me<BR>
If I cease from mine enchantment,<BR>
If I turn away my magic,<BR>
Lift thee from thy slough of horror,<BR>
Loose thee from thy stony prison,<BR>
Free thee from thy killing torment?"<BR>
Answered youthful Youkahainen:<BR>
"Have at home two magic cross-bows,<BR>
Pair of bows of wondrous power,<BR>
One so light a child can bend it,<BR>
Only strength can bend the other,<BR>
Take of these the one that pleases."<BR>
Then the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Do not wish thy magic cross-bows,<BR>
Have a few of such already,<BR>
Thine to me are worse than useless<BR>
I have bows in great abundance,<BR>
Bows on every nail and rafter,<BR>
Bows that laugh at all the hunters,<BR>
Bows that go themselves a-hunting."</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Sang alas! poor Youkahainen<BR>
Deeper into mud and water,<BR>
Deeper in the slough of torment.<BR>
Youkahainen thus made answer:<BR>
"Have at home two magic shallops,<BR>
Beautiful the boats and wondrous;<BR>
One rides light upon the ocean,<BR>
One is made for heavy burdens;<BR>
Take of these the one that pleases."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Do not wish thy magic shallops,<BR>
Have enough of such already;<BR>
All my bays are full of shallops,<BR>
All my shores are lined with shallops,<BR>
Some before the winds are sailors,<BR>
Some were built to sail against them."</P>
<P>Still the Wainola bard and minstrel<BR>
Sings again poor Youkahainen<BR>
Deeper, deeper into torment,<BR>
Into quicksand to his girdle,<BR>
Till the Lapland bard in anguish<BR>
Speaks again to Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Have at home two magic stallions,<BR>
One a racer, fleet as lightning,<BR>
One was born for heavy burdens;<BR>
Take of these the one that pleases."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Neither do I wish thy stallions,<BR>
Do not need thy hawk-limbed stallions,<BR>
Have enough of these already;<BR>
Magic stallions swarm my stables,<BR>
Eating corn at every manger,<BR>
Broad of back to hold the water,<BR>
Water on each croup in lakelets."</P>
<P>Still the bard of Kalevala<BR>
Sings the hapless Lapland minstrel<BR>
Deeper, deeper into torment,<BR>
To his shoulders into water.<BR>
Spake again young Youkahainen:<BR>
"O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Thou the only true magician,<BR>
Cease I pray thee thine enchantment,<BR>
Only turn away thy magic,<BR>
I will give thee gold abundant,<BR>
Countless stores of shining silver;<BR>
From the wars my father brought it,<BR>
Brought it from the hard-fought battles."<BR>
Spake the wise, old Wainamoinen:<BR>
"For thy gold I have no longing,<BR>
Neither do I wish thy silver,<BR>
Have enough of each already;<BR>
Gold abundant fills my chambers,<BR>
On each nail hang bags of silver,<BR>
Gold that glitters in the sunshine,<BR>
Silver shining in the moonlight."</P>
<P>Sank the braggart, Youkahainen,<BR>
Deeper in his slough of torment,<BR>
To his chin in mud and water,<BR>
Ever praying, thus beseeching:<BR>
"O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Greatest of the old magicians,<BR>
Lift me from this pit of horror,<BR>
From this prison-house of torture;<BR>
I will give thee all my corn-fields,<BR>
Give thee all my corn in garners,<BR>
Thus my hapless life to ransom,<BR>
Thus to gain eternal freedom."<BR>
Wainamoinen thus made answer:<BR>
"Take thy corn to other markets,<BR>
Give thy garners to the needy;<BR>
I have corn in great abundance,<BR>
Fields have I in every quarter,<BR>
Corn in all my fields is growing;<BR>
One's own fields are always richer,<BR>
One's own grain is much the sweeter."</P>
<P>Lapland's young and reckless minstrel,<BR>
Sorrow-laden, thus enchanted,<BR>
Deeper sinks in mud and water,<BR>
Fear-enchained and full of anguish,<BR>
In the mire, his beard bedrabbled,<BR>
Mouth once boastful filled with sea-weed,<BR>
In the grass his teeth entangled,<BR>
Youkahainen thus beseeches:<BR>
"O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Wisest of the wisdom-singers,<BR>
Cease at last thine incantations,<BR>
Only turn away thy magic,<BR>
And my former life restore me,<BR>
Lift me from this stifling torment,<BR>
Free mine eyes from sand and water,<BR>
I will give thee sister, Aino,<BR>
Fairest daughter of my mother,<BR>
Bride of thine to be forever,<BR>
Bride of thine to do thy pleasure,<BR>
Sweep the rooms within thy cottage,<BR>
Keep thy dwelling-place in order,<BR>
Rinse for thee the golden platters,<BR>
Spread thy couch with finest linens,<BR>
For thy bed, weave golden covers,<BR>
Bake for thee the honey-biscuit."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Finds at last the wished-for ransom,<BR>
Lapland's young and fairest daughter,<BR>
Sister dear of Youkahainen;<BR>
Happy he, that he has won him,<BR>
In his age a beauteous maiden,<BR>
Bride of his to be forever,<BR>
Pride and joy of Kalevala.<BR>
Now the happy Wainamoinen,<BR>
Sits upon the rock of gladness,<BR>
Joyful on the rock of music,<BR>
Sings a little, sings and ceases,<BR>
Sings again, and sings a third time,<BR>
Thus to break the spell of magic,<BR>
Thus to lessen the enchantment,<BR>
Thus the potent charm to banish.<BR>
As the magic spell is broken,<BR>
Youkahainen, sad, but wiser,<BR>
Drags his feet from out the quicksand,<BR>
Lifts his beard from out the water,<BR>
From the rocks leads forth his courser,<BR>
Brings his sledge back from the rushes,<BR>
Calls his whip back from the ocean,<BR>
Sets his golden sledge in order,<BR>
Throws himself upon the cross-bench,<BR>
Snaps his whip and hies him homeward,<BR>
Hastens homeward, heavy-hearted,<BR>
Sad indeed to meet his mother,<BR>
Aino's mother, gray and aged.<BR>
Careless thus be hastens homeward,<BR>
Nears his home with noise and bustle,<BR>
Reckless drives against the pent-house,<BR>
Breaks the shafts against the portals,<BR>
Breaks his handsome sledge in pieces.</P>
<P>Then his mother, quickly guessing,<BR>
Would have chided him for rashness,<BR>
But the father interrupted:<BR>
"Wherefore dost thou break thy snow-sledge,<BR>
Wherefore dash thy thills in fragments,<BR>
Wherefore comest home so strangely,<BR>
Why this rude and wild behavior?"</P>
<P>Now alas! poor Youkahainen,<BR>
Cap awry upon his forehead,<BR>
Falls to weeping, broken-hearted,<BR>
Head depressed and mind dejected,<BR>
Eyes and lips expressing sadness,<BR>
Answers not his anxious father.</P>
<P>Then the mother quickly asked him,<BR>
Sought to find his cause for sorrow:<BR>
"Tell me, first-born, why thou weepest,<BR>
Why thou weepest, heavy-hearted,<BR>
Why thy mind is so dejected,<BR>
Why thine eyes express such sadness."<BR>
Youkahainen then made answer:<BR>
"Golden mother, ever faithful,<BR>
Cause there is to me sufficient,<BR>
Cause enough in what has happened,<BR>
Bitter cause for this my sorrow,<BR>
Cause for bitter tears and murmurs:<BR>
All my days will pass unhappy,<BR>
Since, O mother of my being,<BR>
I have promised beauteous Aino,<BR>
Aino, thy beloved daughter,<BR>
Aino, my devoted sister,<BR>
To decrepit Wainamoinen,<BR>
Bride to be to him forever,<BR>
Roof above him, prop beneath him,<BR>
Fair companion at his fire-side."</P>
<P>Joyful then arose the mother,<BR>
Clapped her hands in glee together,<BR>
Thus addressing Youkahainen:<BR>
"Weep no more, my son beloved,<BR>
Thou hast naught to cause thy weeping,<BR>
Hast no reason for thy sorrow,<BR>
Often I this hope have cherished;<BR>
Many years have I been praying<BR>
That this mighty bard and hero,<BR>
Wise and valiant Wainamoinen,<BR>
Spouse should be to beauteous Aino,<BR>
Son-in-law to me, her mother."</P>
<P>But the fair and lovely maiden,<BR>
Sister dear of Youkahainen,<BR>
Straightway fell to bitter weeping,<BR>
On the threshold wept and lingered,<BR>
Wept all day and all the night long,<BR>
Wept a second, then a third day,<BR>
Wept because a bitter sorrow<BR>
On her youthful heart had fallen.<BR>
Then the gray-haired mother asked her:<BR>
"Why this weeping, lovely Aino?<BR>
Thou hast found a noble suitor,<BR>
Thou wilt rule his spacious dwelling,<BR>
At his window sit and rest thee,<BR>
Rinse betimes his golden platters,<BR>
Walk a queen within his dwelling."<BR>
Thus replied the tearful Aino:<BR>
"Mother dear, and all-forgiving,<BR>
Cause enough for this my sorrow,<BR>
Cause enough for bitter weeping:<BR>
I must loose my sunny tresses,<BR>
Tresses beautiful and golden,<BR>
Cannot deck my hair with jewels,<BR>
Cannot bind my head with ribbons,<BR>
All to be hereafter hidden<BR>
Underneath the linen bonnet<BR>
That the wife. must wear forever;<BR>
Weep at morning, weep at evening,<BR>
Weep alas! for waning beauty,<BR>
Childhood vanished, youth departed,<BR>
Silver sunshine, golden moonlight,<BR>
Hope and pleasure of my childhood,<BR>
Taken from me now forever,<BR>
And so soon to be forgotten<BR>
At the tool-bench of my brother,<BR>
At the window of my sister,<BR>
In the cottage of my father."</P>
<P>Spake again the gray-haired mother<BR>
To her wailing daughter Aino:<BR>
"Cease thy sorrow, foolish maiden,<BR>
By thy tears thou art ungrateful,<BR>
Reason none for thy repining,<BR>
Not the slightest cause for weeping;<BR>
Everywhere the silver sunshine<BR>
Falls as bright on other households;<BR>
Not alone the moonlight glimmers<BR>
Through thy father's open windows,<BR>
On the work-bench of thy brother;<BR>
Flowers bloom in every meadow,<BR>
Berries grow on every mountain;<BR>
Thou canst go thyself and find them,<BR>
All the day long go and find them;<BR>
Not alone thy brother's meadows<BR>
Grow the beauteous vines and flowers;<BR>
Not alone thy father's mountains<BR>
Yield the ripe, nutritious berries;<BR>
Flowers bloom in other meadows,<BR>
Berries grow on other mountains,<BR>
There as here, my lovely Aino."</P>
