<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SAMPO LOST IN THE SEA.</H1>
<P>LOUHI, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Called her many tribes together,<BR>
Gave the archers bows and arrows,<BR>
Gave her brave men spears and broadswords;<BR>
Fitted out her mightiest war-ship,<BR>
In the vessel placed her army,<BR>
With their swords a hundred heroes,<BR>
With their bows a thousand archers;<BR>
Quick erected masts and sail-yards,<BR>
On the masts her sails of linen<BR>
Hanging like the clouds of heaven,<BR>
Like the white-clouds in the ether,<BR>
Sailed across the seas of Pohya,<BR>
To re-take the wondrous Sampo<BR>
From the heroes of Wainola.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<BR>
Sailed across the deep, blue waters,<BR>
Spake these words to Lemminkainen:<BR>
"O thou daring son of Lempo,<BR>
Best of all my friends and heroes,<BR>
Mount the highest of the topmasts,<BR>
Look before you into ether,<BR>
Look behind you at the heavens,<BR>
Well examine the horizon,<BR>
Whether clear or filled with trouble."</P>
<P>Climbed the daring Lemminkainen,<BR>
Ever ready for a venture,<BR>
To the highest of the mastheads;<BR>
Looked he eastward, also westward,<BR>
Looked he northward, also southward,<BR>
Then addressed wise Wainamoinen.<BR>
"Clear the sky appears before me,<BR>
But behind a dark horizon;<BR>
In the north a cloud is rising,<BR>
And a longer cloud at north-west."<BR>
Wainamoinen thus made answer:<BR>
Art thou speaking truth or fiction?<BR>
I am fearful that the war-ships<BR>
Of Pohyola are pursuing;<BR>
Look again with keener vision."</P>
<P>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Looked again and spake as follows:<BR>
"In the distance seems a forest,<BR>
In the south appears an island,<BR>
Aspen-groves with falcons laden,<BR>
Alders laden with the wood-grouse."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Surely thou art speaking falsehood;<BR>
'Tis no forest in the distance,<BR>
Neither aspen, birch, nor alders,<BR>
Laden with the grouse, or falcon;<BR>
I am fearful that Pohyola<BR>
Follows with her magic armies;<BR>
Look again with keener vision."</P>
<P>Then the daring Lemminkainen<BR>
Looked the third time from the topmast,<BR>
Spake and these the words be uttered:<BR>
"From the north a boat pursues us,<BR>
Driven by a hundred rowers,<BR>
Carrying a thousand heroes!"</P>
<P>Knew at last old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Knew the truth of his inquiry,<BR>
Thus addressed his fleeing people:<BR>
"Row, O blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Row, O mighty Lemminkainen,<BR>
Row, all ye my noble oarsmen,<BR>
That our boat may skim the waters,<BR>
May escape from our pursuers!"</P>
<P>Rowed the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Rowed the mighty Lemminkainen,<BR>
With them rowed the other heroes;<BR>
Heavily groaned the helm of birch-wood,<BR>
Loudly rattled all the row-locks;<BR>
All the vessel shook and trembled,<BR>
Like a cataract it thundered<BR>
As it plowed the waste of waters,<BR>
Tossing sea-foam to the heavens.<BR>
Strongly rowed Wainola's forces,<BR>
Strongly were their arms united;<BR>
But the distance did not widen<BR>
Twixt the boat and their pursuers.</P>
<P>Quick the hero, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Saw misfortune hanging over,<BR>
Saw destruction in the distance<BR>
Heavy-hearted, long reflecting,<BR>
Trouble-laden, spake as follows:<BR>
"Only is there one salvation,<BR>
Know one miracle for safety!"</P>
<P>Then he grasped his box of tinder,<BR>
From the box he took a flint-stone,<BR>
Of the tinder took some fragments,<BR>
Cast the fragments on the waters,<BR>
Spake these words of master-magic.<BR>
"Let from these arise a mountain<BR>
From the bottom of the deep-sea,<BR>
Let a rock arise in water,<BR>
That the war-ship of Pohyola,<BR>
With her thousand men and heroes,<BR>
May be wrecked upon the summit,<BR>
By the aid of surging billows."</P>
<P>Instantly a reef arises,<BR>
In the sea springs up a mountain,<BR>
Eastward, westward, through the waters.<BR>
Came the war-ship of the Northland,<BR>
Through the floods the boat came steering,<BR>
Sailed against the mountain-ledges,<BR>
Fastened on the rocks in water,<BR>
Wrecked upon the Mount of Magic.<BR>
In the deep-sea fell the topmasts,<BR>
Fell the sails upon the billows,<BR>
Carried by the winds and waters<BR>
O'er the waves of toil and trouble.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Tries to free her sinking vessel,<BR>
Tries to rescue from destruction;<BR>
But she cannot raise the war-ship,<BR>
Firmly fixed upon the mountain;<BR>
Shattered are the ribs and rudder,<BR>
Ruined is the ship of Pohya.</P>
<P>Then the hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Much disheartened, spake as follows:<BR>
"Where the force, in earth or heaven,<BR>
That will help a soul in trouble?"</P>
<P>Quick she changes form and feature,<BR>
Makes herself another body;<BR>
Takes five sharpened scythes of iron,<BR>
Also takes five goodly sickles,<BR>
Shapes them into eagle-talons;<BR>
Takes the body of the vessel,<BR>
Makes the frame-work of an eagle;<BR>
Takes the vessel's ribs and flooring<BR>
Makes them into wings and breastplate;<BR>
For the tail she shapes the rudder;<BR>
In the wings she plants a thousand<BR>
Seniors with their bows and arrows;<BR>
Sets a thousand magic heroes<BR>
In the body, armed with broadswords<BR>
In the tail a hundred archers,<BR>
With their deadly spears and cross-bows,<BR>
Thus the bird is hero-feathered.<BR>
Quick she spreads her mighty pinions,<BR>
Rises as a monster-eagle,<BR>
Flies on high, and soars, and circles<BR>
With one wing she sweeps the heavens,<BR>
While the other sweeps the waters.<BR>
Spake the hero's ocean-mother:<BR>
"O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Turn thy vision to the north-east,<BR>
Cast thine eyes upon the sunrise,<BR>
Look behind thy fleeing vessel,<BR>
See the eagle of misfortune!"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen turned as bidden,<BR>
Turned his vision to the north-east,<BR>
Cast his eyes upon the sunrise,<BR>
There beheld the Northland-hostess,<BR>
Wicked witch of Sariola,<BR>
Flying as a monster-eagle,<BR>
Swooping on his mighty war-ship;<BR>
Flies and perches on the topmast,<BR>
On the sail-yards firmly settles;<BR>
Nearly overturns the vessel<BR>
Of the heroes of Wainola,<BR>
Underneath the weight of envy.</P>
<P>Then the hero, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Turned to Ukko as his refuge,<BR>
Thus entreated his Creator:<BR>
"Ukko, thou O God in heaven,<BR>
Thou Creator full of mercy,<BR>
Guard us from impending danger,<BR>
That thy children may not perish,<BR>
May not meet with fell destruction.<BR>
Hither bring thy magic fire-cloak,<BR>
That thy people, thus protected,<BR>
May resist Pohyola's forces,<BR>
Well may fight against the hostess<BR>
Of the dismal Sariola,<BR>
May not fall before her weapons,<BR>
May not in the deep-sea perish!"</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:<BR>
"O thou hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Wilt thou now divide the Sampo,<BR>
On the fog-point in the water,<BR>
On the island forest-covered?<BR>
Thus the Northland hostess answered:<BR>
"I will not divide the Sampo,<BR>
Not with thee, thou evil wizard,<BR>
Not with wicked Wainamoinen!"</P>
<P>Quick the mighty eagle, Louhi,<BR>
Swoops upon the lid in colors,<BR>
Grasps the Sampo in her talons;<BR>
But the daring Lemminkainen<BR>
Straightway draws his blade of battle,<BR>
Draws his broadsword from his girdle,<BR>
Cleaves the talons of the eagle,<BR>
One toe only is uninjured,<BR>
Speaks these magic words of conquest:<BR>
"Down, ye spears, and down, ye broadswords,<BR>
Down, ye thousand witless heroes,<BR>
Down, ye feathered hosts of Louhi!"</P>
<P>Spake the hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Calling, screeching, from the sail-yards:<BR>
"O thou faithless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Wicked wizard, Kaukomieli,<BR>
To deceive thy trusting mother!<BR>
Thou didst give to her thy promise,<BR>
Not to go to war for ages,<BR>
Not to war for sixty summers,<BR>
Though desire for gold impels thee,<BR>
Though thou wishest gold and silver!</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient hero,<BR>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<BR>
Thinking he had met destruction,<BR>
Snatched the rudder from the waters,<BR>
With it smote the monster-eagle,<BR>
Smote the, eagle's iron talons,<BR>
Smote her countless feathered heroes.<BR>
From her breast her hosts descended,<BR>
Spearmen fell upon the billows,<BR>
From the wings descend a thousand,<BR>
From the tail, a hundred archers.<BR>
Swoops again the bird of Pohya<BR>
To the bottom of the vessel,<BR>
Like the hawk from birch or aspen,<BR>
Like the falcon from the linden;<BR>
Grasps the Sampo with one talon,<BR>
Drags the treasure to the waters,<BR>
Drops the magic lid in colors<BR>
From the red rim of the war-ship<BR>
To the bottom of the deep-sea,<BR>
Where the Sampo breaks in pieces,<BR>
Scatters through the Alue-waters,<BR>
In the mighty deeps for ages,<BR>
To increase the ocean's treasures,<BR>
Treasures for the hosts of Ahto.<BR>
Nevermore will there be wanting<BR>
Richness for the Ahto-nation,<BR>
Never while the moonlight brightens<BR>
On the waters of the Northland.</P>
<P>Many fragments of the Sampo<BR>
Floated on the purple waters,<BR>
On the waters deep and boundless,<BR>
Rocked by winds and waves of Suomi,<BR>
Carried by the rolling billows<BR>
To the sea-sides of Wainola.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Saw the fragments of the treasure<BR>
Floating on the billows landward,<BR>
Fragments of the lid in colors,<BR>
Much rejoicing, spake as follows:<BR>
"Thence will come the sprouting seed-grain,<BR>
The beginning of good fortune,<BR>
The unending of resources,<BR>
From the plowing and the sowing,<BR>
From the glimmer of the moonlight,<BR>
From the splendor of the sunshine,<BR>
On the fertile plains of Suomi,<BR>
On the meads of Kalevala."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Thus addressed old Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Know I other mighty measures,<BR>
Know I means that are efficient,<BR>
And against thy golden moonlight,<BR>
And the splendor of thy sunshine,<BR>
And thy plowing, and thy reaping;<BR>
In the rocks I'll sink the moonbeams,<BR>
Hide the sun within the mountain,<BR>
Let the frost destroy thy sowings,<BR>
Freeze the crops on all thy corn-fields;<BR>
Iron-hail I'll send from heaven,<BR>
On the richness of thine acres,<BR>
On the barley of thy planting;<BR>
I will drive the bear from forests,<BR>
Send thee Otso from the thickets,<BR>
That he may destroy thy cattle,<BR>
May annihilate thy sheep-folds,<BR>
May destroy thy steeds at pasture.<BR>
I will send thee nine diseases,<BR>
Each more fatal than the other,<BR>
That will sicken all thy people,<BR>
Make thy children sink and perish,<BR>
Nevermore to visit Northland,<BR>
Never while the moonlight glimmers<BR>
On the plains of Kalevala!"<BR>
Thus the ancient bard made answer:<BR>
"Not a Laplander can banish<BR>
Wainamoinen and his people;<BR>
Never can a Turyalander<BR>
Drive my tribes from Kalevala;<BR>
God alone has power to banish,<BR>
God controls the fate of nations,<BR>
Never trusts the arms of evil,<BR>
Never gives His strength to others.<BR>
As I trust in my Creator,<BR>
Call upon benignant Ukko,<BR>
He will guard my crops from danger<BR>
Drive the Frost-fiend from my corn-fields,<BR>
Drive great Otso to his caverns.</P>
<P>"Wicked Louhi of Pohyola,<BR>
Thou canst banish evil-doers,<BR>
In the rocks canst hide the wicked,<BR>
In thy mountains lock the guilty;<BR>
Thou canst never hide the moonlight,<BR>
Never bide the silver sunshine,<BR>
In the caverns of thy kingdom.<BR>
Freeze the crops of thine own planting,<BR>
Freeze the barley of thy sowing,<BR>
Send thine iron-hail from heaven<BR>
To destroy the Lapland corn-fields,<BR>
To annihilate thy people,<BR>
To destroy the hosts of Pohya;<BR>
Send great Otso from the heather,<BR>
Send the sharp-tooth from the forest,<BR>
To the fields of Sariola,<BR>
On the herds and flocks of Louhi!"</P>
<P>Thus the wicked hostess answered:<BR>
"All my power has departed,<BR>
All my strength has gone to others,<BR>
All my hope is in the deep-sea;<BR>
In the waters lies my Sampo!"</P>
<P>Then the hostess of Pohyola<BR>
Home departed, weeping, wailing,<BR>
To the land of cold and darkness;<BR>
Only took some worthless fragments<BR>
Of the Sampo to her people;<BR>
Carried she the lid to Pohya,<BR>
In the blue-sea left the handle;<BR>
Hence the poverty of Northland,<BR>
And the famines of Pohyola.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Hastened to the broad-sea's margin,<BR>
Stepped upon the shore in joyance;<BR>
Found there fragments of the Sampo,<BR>
Fragments of the lid in colors,<BR>
On the borders of the waters,<BR>
On the curving sands and sea-sides;<BR>
Gathered well the Sampo-relics<BR>
From the waters near the fog-point,<BR>
On the island forest-covered.</P>
<P>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Spake these words in supplication:<BR>
"Grant, O Ukko, our Creator,<BR>
Grant to us, thy needful children,<BR>
Peace, and happiness, and plenty,<BR>
That our lives may be successful,<BR>
That our days may end in honor,<BR>
On the vales and hills of Suomi,<BR>
On the prairies of Wainola,<BR>
In the homes of Kalevala!</P>
<P>"Ukko, wise and good Creator,<BR>
Ukko, God of love and mercy,<BR>
Shelter and protect thy people<BR>
From the evil-minded heroes,<BR>
From the wiles of wicked women,<BR>
That our country's plagues may leave us,<BR>
That thy faithful tribes may prosper.<BR>
Be our friend and strong protector,<BR>
Be the helper of thy children,<BR>
In the night a roof above them,<BR>
In the day a shield around them,<BR>
That the sunshine may not vanish,<BR>
That the moonlight may not lessen,<BR>
That the killing frosts may leave them,<BR>
And destructive hail pass over.<BR>
Build a metal wall around us,<BR>
From the valleys to the heavens;<BR>
Build of stone a mighty fortress<BR>
On the borders of Wainola,<BR>
Where thy people live and labor,<BR>
As their dwelling-place forever,<BR>
Sure protection to thy people,<BR>
Where the wicked may not enter,<BR>
Nor the thieves break through and pilfer,<BR>
Never while the moonlight glistens,<BR>
And the Sun brings golden blessings<BR>
To the plains of Kalevala."</P>
