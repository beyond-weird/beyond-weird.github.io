<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">EPILOGUE.</H1>
<P>Now I end my measured singing,<BR>
Bid my weary tongue keep silence,<BR>
Leave my songs to other singers.<BR>
Horses have their times of resting<BR>
After many hours of labor;<BR>
Even sickles will grow weary<BR>
When they have been long at reaping;<BR>
Waters seek a quiet haven<BR>
After running long in rivers;<BR>
Fire subsides and sinks in slumber<BR>
At the dawning of the morning<BR>
Therefore I should end my singing,<BR>
As my song is growing weary,<BR>
For the pleasure of the evening,<BR>
For the joy of morn arising.</P>
<P>Often I have heard it chanted,<BR>
Often heard the words repeated:<BR>
"Worthy cataracts and rivers<BR>
Never empty all their waters."<BR>
Thus the wise and worthy singer<BR>
Sings not all his garnered wisdom;<BR>
Better leave unsung some sayings<BR>
Than to sing them out of season.</P>
<P>Thus beginning, and thus ending,<BR>
Do I roll up all my legends,<BR>
Roll them in a ball for safety,<BR>
In my memory arrange them,<BR>
In their narrow place of resting,<BR>
Lest the songs escape unheeded,<BR>
While the lock is still unopened,<BR>
While the teeth remain unparted,<BR>
And the weary tongue is silent.<BR>
Why should I sing other legends,<BR>
Chant them in the glen and forest,<BR>
Sing them on the hill and heather?<BR>
Cold and still my golden mother<BR>
Lies beneath the meadow, sleeping,<BR>
Hears my ancient songs no longer,<BR>
Cannot listen to my singing;<BR>
Only will the forest listen,<BR>
Sacred birches, sighing pine-trees,<BR>
Junipers endowed with kindness,<BR>
Alder-trees that love to bear me,<BR>
With the aspens and the willows.</P>
<P>When my loving mother left me,<BR>
Young was I, and low of stature;<BR>
Like the cuckoo of the forest,<BR>
Like the thrush upon the heather,<BR>
Like the lark I learned to twitter,<BR>
Learned to sing my simple measures,<BR>
Guided by a second mother,<BR>
Stern and cold, without affection;<BR>
Drove me helpless from my chamber<BR>
To the wind-side of her dwelling,<BR>
To the north-side of her cottage,<BR>
Where the chilling winds in mercy<BR>
Carried off the unprotected.<BR>
As a lark I learned to wander,<BR>
Wander as a lonely song-bird,<BR>
Through the forests and the fenlands<BR>
Quietly o'er hill and heather;<BR>
Walked in pain about the marshes,<BR>
Learned the songs of winds and waters,<BR>
Learned the music of the ocean,<BR>
And the echoes of the woodlands.</P>
<P>Many men that live to murmur,<BR>
Many women live to censure,<BR>
Many speak with evil motives;<BR>
Many they with wretched voices<BR>
Curse me for my wretched singing,<BR>
Blame my tongue for speaking wisdom,<BR>
Call my ancient songs unworthy,<BR>
Blame the songs and curse the singer.<BR>
Be not thus, my worthy people,<BR>
Blame me not for singing badly,<BR>
Unpretending as a minstrel.<BR>
I have never had the teaching,<BR>
Never lived with ancient heroes,<BR>
Never learned the tongues of strangers,<BR>
Never claimed to know much wisdom.<BR>
Others have had language-masters,<BR>
Nature was my only teacher,<BR>
Woods and waters my instructors.<BR>
Homeless, friendless, lone, and needy,<BR>
Save in childhood with my mother,<BR>
When beneath her painted rafters,<BR>
Where she twirled the flying spindle,<BR>
By the work-bench of my brother,<BR>
By the window of my sister,<BR>
In. the cabin of my father,<BR>
In my early days of childhood.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, my people,<BR>
This may point the way to others,<BR>
To the singers better gifted,<BR>
For the good of future ages,<BR>
For the coming generations,<BR>
For the rising folk of Suomi.</P>
