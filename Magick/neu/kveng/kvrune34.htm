<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">RUNE XXXIV.</H1>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">KULLERVO FINDS HIS TRIBE-FOLK.</H1>
<P>KULLERWOINEN, young magician,<BR>
In his beauteous, golden ringlets,<BR>
In his magic shoes of deer-skin,<BR>
Left the home of Ilmarinen<BR>
Wandered forth upon his journey,<BR>
Ere the blacksmith heard the tidings<BR>
Of the cruel death and torture<BR>
Of his wife and joy-companion,<BR>
Lest a bloody fight should follow.</P>
<P>Kullerwoinen left the smithy,<BR>
Blowing on his magic bugle,<BR>
Joyful left the lands of Ilma,<BR>
Blowing blithely on the heather,<BR>
Made the distant hills re-echo,<BR>
Made the swamps and mountains tremble,<BR>
Made the heather-blossoms answer<BR>
To the music of his cow-horn,<BR>
In its wild reverberations,<BR>
To the magic of his playing.<BR>
Songs were heard within the smithy,<BR>
And the blacksmith stopped and listened,<BR>
Hastened to the door and window,<BR>
Hastened to the open court-yard,<BR>
If perchance he might discover<BR>
What was playing on the heather,<BR>
What was sounding through the forest.<BR>
Quick he learned the cruel story,<BR>
Learned the cause of the rejoicing,<BR>
Saw the hostess dead before him,<BR>
Knew his beauteous wife had perished,<BR>
Saw the lifeless form extended,<BR>
In the court-yard of his dwelling.<BR>
Thereupon the metal-artist<BR>
Fell to bitter tears and wailings,<BR>
Wept through all the dreary night-time,<BR>
Deep the grief that settled o'er him,<BR>
Black as night his darkened future,<BR>
Could not stay his tears of sorrow.</P>
<P>Kullerwoinen hastened onward,<BR>
Straying, roaming, hither, thither,<BR>
Wandered on through field and forest,<BR>
O'er the Hisi-plains and woodlands.<BR>
When the darkness settled o'er him,<BR>
When the bird of night was flitting,<BR>
Sat the fatherless at evening,<BR>
The forsaken sat and rested<BR>
On a hillock of the forest.<BR>
Thus he murmured, heavy-hearted:<BR>
"Why was I, alas! created,<BR>
Why was I so ill-begotten,<BR>
Since for months and years I wander,<BR>
Lost among the ether-spaces?<BR>
Others have their homes to dwell in,<BR>
Others hasten to their firesides<BR>
As the evening gathers round them:<BR>
But my home is in the forest,<BR>
And my bed upon the heather,<BR>
And my bath-room is the rain-cloud.</P>
<P>"Never didst thou, God of mercy,<BR>
Never in the course of ages,<BR>
Give an infant birth unwisely;<BR>
Wherefore then was I created,<BR>
Fatherless to roam in ether,<BR>
Motherless and lone to wander?<BR>
Thou, O Ukko, art my father,<BR>
Thou hast given me form and feature;<BR>
As the sea-gull on the ocean,<BR>
As the duck upon the waters,<BR>
Shines the Sun upon the swallow,<BR>
Shines as bright upon the sparrow,<BR>
Gives the joy-birds song and gladness,<BR>
Does not shine on me unhappy;<BR>
Nevermore will shine the sunlight,<BR>
Never will the moonlight glimmer<BR>
On this hapless son and orphan;<BR>
Do not know my hero-father,<BR>
Cannot tell who was my mother;<BR>
On the shore, perhaps the gray-duck<BR>
Left me in the sand to perish.<BR>
Young was I and small of stature,<BR>
When my mother left me orphaned;<BR>
Dead, my father and my mother,<BR>
Dead, my honored tribe of heroes;<BR>
Shoes they left me that are icy,<BR>
Stockings filled with frosts of ages,<BR>
Let me on the freezing ice-plains<BR>
Fall to perish in the rushes;<BR>
From the giddy heights of mountains<BR>
Let me tumble to destruction.</P>
<P>"O, thou wise and good Creator,<BR>
Why my birth and what my service?<BR>
I shall never fall and perish<BR>
On the ice-plains, in the marshes,<BR>
Never be a bridge in swamp-land,<BR>
Not while I have arms of virtue<BR>
That can serve my honored kindred!"</P>
<P>Then Kullervo thought to journey<BR>
To the village of Untamo,<BR>
To avenge his father's murder,<BR>
To avenge his mother's tortures,<BR>
And the troubles of his tribe-folk.<BR>
These the words of Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"Wait, yea wait, thou Untamoinen,<BR>
Thou destroyer of my people;<BR>
When I meet thee in the combat,<BR>
I will slay thee and thy kindred,<BR>
I will burn thy homes to ashes!"</P>
<P>Came a woman on the highway,<BR>
Dressed in blue, the aged mother,<BR>
To Kullervo spake as follows:<BR>
"Whither goest, Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Whither hastes the wayward hero?<BR>
Kullerwoinen gave this answer:<BR>
"I have thought that I would journey<BR>
To the far-off land of strangers,<BR>
To the village of Untamo,<BR>
To avenge my father's murder,<BR>
To avenge my mother's tortures,<BR>
And the troubles of my tribe-folk."<BR>
Thus the gray-haired woman answered:<BR>
"Surely thou dost rest in error,<BR>
For thy tribe has never perished,<BR>
And thy mother still is living<BR>
With thy father in the Northland,<BR>
Living with the old Kalervo."</P>
<P>"O, thou ancient dame beloved,<BR>
Worthy mother of the woodlands,<BR>
Tell me where my father liveth,<BR>
Where my loving mother lingers!"</P>
<P>"Yonder lives thine aged father,<BR>
And thy loving mother with him,<BR>
On the farthest shore of Northland,<BR>
On the long-point of the fish-lake!"</P>
<P>"Tell me, O thou woodland-mother,<BR>
How to journey to my people,<BR>
How to find mine honored tribe-folk."</P>
<P>"Easy is the way for strangers:<BR>
Thou must journey through the forest,<BR>
Hasten to the river-border,<BR>
Travel one day, then a second,<BR>
And the third from morn till even,<BR>
To the north-west, thou must journey.<BR>
If a mountain comes to meet thee,<BR>
Go around the nearing mountain,<BR>
Westward bold thy weary journey,<BR>
Till thou comest to a river,<BR>
On thy right hand flowing eastward;<BR>
Travel to the river border,<BR>
Where three water-falls will greet thee;<BR>
When thou comest to a headland,<BR>
On the point thou'lt see a cottage<BR>
Where the fishermen assemble;<BR>
In this cottage is thy father,<BR>
With thy mother and her daughters,<BR>
Beautiful thy maiden sisters."</P>
<P>Kullerwoinen, the magician,<BR>
Hastens northward on his journey,<BR>
Walks one day, and then a second,<BR>
Walks the third from morn till evening;<BR>
To the north-west walks Kullervo,<BR>
Till a mountain comes to meet him,<BR>
Walks around the nearing mountain;<BR>
Westward, westward, holds his journey,<BR>
Till he sees a river coming;<BR>
Hastens to the river border,<BR>
Walks along the streams and rapids<BR>
Till three waterfalls accost him;<BR>
Travels till he meets a headland,<BR>
On the point he spies a cottage,<BR>
Where the fishermen assemble.</P>
<P>Quick he journeys to the cabin,<BR>
Quick he passes through the portals<BR>
Of the cottage on the headland,<BR>
Where he finds his long-lost kindred;<BR>
No one knows the youth, Kullervo,<BR>
No one knows whence comes the stranger,<BR>
Where his home, nor where he goeth.<BR>
These the words of young Kullervo:<BR>
"Dost thou know me not, my mother,<BR>
Dost thou know me not, my father?<BR>
I am hapless Kullerwoinen<BR>
Whom the heroes of Untamo<BR>
Carried to their distant country,<BR>
When my height was but a hand-breadth."<BR>
Quick the hopeful mother answers:<BR>
"O my worthy son, beloved,<BR>
O my precious silver-buckle,<BR>
Hast thou with thy mind of magic,<BR>
Wandered through the fields of Northland<BR>
Searching for thy home and kindred?<BR>
As one dead I long have mourned thee,<BR>
Had supposed thee, in Manala.<BR>
Once I had two sons and heroes,<BR>
Had two good and beauteous daughters,<BR>
Two of these have long been absent,<BR>
Elder son and elder daughter;<BR>
For the wars my son departed,<BR>
While my daughter strayed and perished<BR>
If my son is home returning,<BR>
Yet my daughter still is absent,<BR>
Kullerwoinen asked his mother:<BR>
"Whither did my sister wander,<BR>
What direction did she journey ?<BR>
This the answer of the mother:<BR>
"This the story of thy sister:<BR>
Went for berries to the woodlands,<BR>
To the mountains went my daughter,<BR>
Where the lovely maiden vanished,<BR>
Where my pretty berry perished,<BR>
Died some death beyond my knowledge,<BR>
Nameless is the death she suffered.<BR>
Who is mourning for the daughter?<BR>
No one mourns her as her mother,<BR>
Walks and wanders, Mourns and searches,<BR>
For her fairest child and daughter;<BR>
Therefore did the mother wander,<BR>
Searching for thy lovely sister,<BR>
Like the bear she roamed the forest,<BR>
Ran the glenways like the adder,<BR>
Searched one day and then a second,<BR>
Searched the third from morn till even,<BR>
Till she reached the mountain-summit,<BR>
There she called and called her daughter,<BR>
Till the distant mountains answered,<BR>
Called to her who had departed:<BR>
I Where art thou, my lovely maiden,<BR>
Come my daughter to thy mother!'</P>
<P>"Thus I called, and sought thy sister,<BR>
This the answer of the mountains,<BR>
Thus the hills and valleys echoed:<BR>
'Call no more, thou weeping mother,<BR>
Weep no more for the departed;<BR>
Nevermore in all thy lifetime,<BR>
Never in the course of ages,<BR>
Will she join again her kindred,<BR>
At her brother's landing-places,<BR>
In her father's humble dwelling.'"</P>
