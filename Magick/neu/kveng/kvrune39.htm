<P>WAINAMOINEN, old and faithful,<BR>
Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<BR>
"O thou wonder-working brother,<BR>
Let us go to Sariola,<BR>
There to gain the magic Sampo,<BR>
There to see the lid in colors."<BR>
Ilmarinen gave this answer:<BR>
"Hard indeed to seize the Sampo,<BR>
Neither can the lid be captured<BR>
From the never-pleasant Northland,<BR>
From the dismal Sariola.<BR>
Louhi took away the Sampo,<BR>
Carried off the lid in colors<BR>
To the stone-mount of Pohyola;<BR>
Hid it in the copper mountain,<BR>
Where nine locks secure the treasure.<BR>
Many young roots sprout around it,<BR>
Grow nine fathoms deep in sand-earth,<BR>
One great root beneath the mountain,<BR>
In the cataract a second,<BR>
And a third beneath the castle<BR>
Built upon the mount of ages."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Brother mine, and wonder-worker,<BR>
Let us go to Sariola,<BR>
That we may secure the Sampo;<BR>
Let us build a goodly vessel,<BR>
Bring the Sampo to Wainola,<BR>
Bring away the lid in colors,<BR>
From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<BR>
From the copper-bearing mountain.<BR>
Where the miracle lies anchored."<BR>
Ilmarinen thus made answer:<BR>
"By the land the way is safer,<BR>
Lempo travels on the ocean,<BR>
Ghastly Death upon his shoulder;<BR>
On the sea the waves will drift us,<BR>
And the storm-winds wreck our vessel;<BR>
Then our bands must do the rowing,<BR>
And our feet must steer us homeward."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Safe indeed by land to journey,<BR>
But the way is rough and trying,<BR>
Long the road and full of turnings;<BR>
Lovely is the ship on ocean,<BR>
Beautiful to ride the billows,<BR>
Journey easy o'er the waters,<BR>
Sailing in a trusty vessel;<BR>
Should the West-wind cross our pathway,<BR>
Will the South-wind drive us northward.<BR>
Be that as it may, my brother,<BR>
Since thou dost not love the water,<BR>
By the land then let us journey.<BR>
Forge me now the sword of battle,<BR>
Forge for me the mighty fire-sword,<BR>
That I may destroy the wild-beasts,<BR>
Frighten all the Northland people,<BR>
As we journey for the Sampo<BR>
To the cold and dismal village,<BR>
To the never-pleasant Northland,<BR>
To the dismal Sariola."</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
The eternal forger-artist,<BR>
Laid the metals in the furnace,<BR>
In the fire laid steel and iron,<BR>
In the hot-coals, gold and silver,<BR>
Rightful measure of the metals;<BR>
Set the workmen at the furnace,<BR>
Lustily they plied the bellows.<BR>
Like the wax the iron melted,<BR>
Like the dough the hard steel softened,<BR>
Like the water ran the silver,<BR>
And the liquid gold flowed after.</P>
<P>Then the minstrel, Ilmarinen,<BR>
The eternal wonder-forger,<BR>
Looks within his magic furnace,<BR>
On the border of his oven,<BR>
There beholds the fire-sword forming,<BR>
Sees the blade with golden handle;<BR>
Takes the weapon from the furnace,<BR>
Lays it on his heavy anvil<BR>
For the falling of the hammer;<BR>
Forges well the blade of magic,<BR>
Well the heavy sword be tempers,<BR>
Ornaments the hero-weapon<BR>
With the finest gold and silver.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
Comes to view the blade of conquest,<BR>
Lifts admiringly the fire-sword,<BR>
Then these words the hero utters:<BR>
"Does the weapon match the soldier,<BR>
Does the handle suit the bearer?<BR>
Yea, the blade and hilt are molded<BR>
To the wishes of the minstrel."</P>
<P>On the sword-point gleams the moonlight,<BR>
On the blade the sun is shining,<BR>
On the hilt the bright stars twinkle,<BR>
On the edge a horse is neighing,<BR>
On the handle plays a kitten,<BR>
On the sheath a dog is barking.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen wields his fire-sword,<BR>
Tests it on the iron-mountain,<BR>
And these words the hero utters:<BR>
"With this broadsword I could quickly<BR>
Cleave in twain the mount of Pohya,<BR>
Cut the flinty rocks asunder."<BR>
Spake the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Wherewith shall I guard from danger,<BR>
How protect myself from evil,<BR>
From the ills by land and water?<BR>
Shall I wear an iron armor,<BR>
Belt of steel around my body?<BR>
Stronger is a man in armor,<BR>
Safer in a mail of copper."</P>
<P>Now the time has come to journey<BR>
To the never-pleasant Northland;<BR>
Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
And his brother, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Hasten to the field and forest,<BR>
Searching for their fiery coursers,<BR>
In each shining belt a bridle,<BR>
With a harness on their shoulders.<BR>
In the woods they find a race;<BR>
In the glen a steed of battle,<BR>
Ready for his master's service.<BR>
Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
And the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Throw the harness on the courser,<BR>
Hitch him to the sledge of conquest,<BR>
Hasten on their journey Northward;<BR>
Drive along the broad-sea's margin<BR>
Till they bear some one lamenting<BR>
On the strand hear something wailing<BR>
Near the landing-place of vessels.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Speaks these words in wonder, guessing,<BR>
"This must be some maiden weeping,<BR>
Some fair daughter thus lamenting;<BR>
Let us journey somewhat nearer,<BR>
To discover whence this wailing."</P>
<P>Drew they nearer, nearer, nearer,<BR>
Hoping thus to find a maiden<BR>
Weeping on the sandy sea-shore.<BR>
It was not a maiden weeping,<BR>
But a vessel, sad, and lonely,<BR>
Waiting on the shore and wailing.<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Why art weeping, goodly vessel,<BR>
What the cause of thy lamenting?<BR>
Art thou mourning for thy row-locks,<BR>
Is thy rigging ill-adjusted?<BR>
Dost thou weep since thou art anchored<BR>
On the shore in times of trouble?"<BR>
Thus the war-ship spake in answer:<BR>
"To the waters would this vessel<BR>
Haste upon the well-tarred rollers,<BR>
As a happy maiden journeys<BR>
To the cottage of her husband.<BR>
I, alas! a goodly vessel,<BR>
Weep because I lie at anchor,<BR>
Weep and wail because no hero<BR>
Sets me free upon the waters,<BR>
Free to ride the rolling billows.<BR>
It was said when I was fashioned,<BR>
Often sung when I was building,<BR>
That this bark should be for battle,<BR>
Should become a mighty war-ship,<BR>
Carry in my hull great treasures,<BR>
Priceless goods across the ocean.<BR>
Never have I sailed to conquest,<BR>
Never have I carried booty;<BR>
Other vessels not as worthy<BR>
To the wars are ever sailing,<BR>
Sailing to the songs of battle.<BR>
Three times in the summer season<BR>
Come they home with treasures laden,<BR>
In their hulls bring gold and silver;<BR>
I, alas! a worthy vessel,<BR>
Many months have lain at anchor,<BR>
I, a war-ship well constructed,<BR>
Am decaying in the harbor,<BR>
Never having sailed to conquest;<BR>
Worms are gnawing at my vitals,<BR>
In my hull their dwelling-places,<BR>
And ill-omened birds of heaven<BR>
Build their nests within my rigging;<BR>
Frogs and lizards of the forest<BR>
Play about my oars and rudder;<BR>
Three times better for this vessel<BR>
Were he but a valley birch-tree,<BR>
Or an aspen on the heather,<BR>
With the squirrels in his branches,<BR>
And the dogs beneath them barking!"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and faithfull<BR>
Thus addressed the ship at anchor:<BR>
"Weep no more, thou goodly vessel,<BR>
Man-of-war, no longer murmur;<BR>
Thou shalt sail to Sariola,<BR>
Sing the war-songs of the Northland,<BR>
Sail with us to deadly combat.<BR>
Wert thou built by the Creator,<BR>
Thou canst sail the roughest waters,<BR>
Sidewise journey o'er the ocean;<BR>
Dost not need the hand to touch thee,<BR>
Dost not need the foot to turn thee,<BR>
Needing nothing to propel thee."<BR>
Thus the weeping boat made answer:<BR>
"Cannot sail without assistance,<BR>
Neither can my brother-vessels<BR>
Sail unaided o'er the waters,<BR>
Sail across the waves undriven."<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Should I lead thee to the broad-sea,<BR>
Wilt thou journey north unaided,<BR>
Sail without the help of rowers,<BR>
Sail without the aid of south-winds,<BR>
Sail without the b elm to guide thee?<BR>
Thus the wailing ship replying:<BR>
Cannot sail without assistance,<BR>
Neither can my brother-vessels<BR>
Sail without the aid of rowers,<BR>
Sail without the help of south-winds,<BR>
Nor without the helm to guide them."<BR>
These the words of Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Wilt thou run with aid of oarsmen<BR>
When the south-winds give assistance,<BR>
Guided by a skillful pilot?"<BR>
This the answer of the war-ship:<BR>
"Quickly can I course these waters,<BR>
When my oars are manned by rowers,<BR>
When my sails are filled with south-winds,<BR>
All my goodly brother-vessels<BR>
Sail the ocean with assistance,<BR>
When the master holds the rudder."</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Left the racer on the sea-side,<BR>
Tied him to the sacred birch-tree,<BR>
Hung the harness on a willow,<BR>
Rolled the vessel to the waters,<BR>
Sang the ship upon the broad-sea,<BR>
Asked the boat this simple question:<BR>
"O thou vessel, well-appearing<BR>
From the mighty oak constructed,<BR>
Art thou strong to carry treasures<BR>
As in view thou art commanding?<BR>
Thus the goodly ship made answer:<BR>
"Strong am I to carry treasures,<BR>
In my hull a golden cargo;<BR>
I can bear a hundred oarsmen,<BR>
And of warriors a thousand."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
Then began his wondrous singing.<BR>
On one side the magic vessel,<BR>
Sang he youth with golden virtues,<BR>
Bearded youth with strength of heroes,<BR>
Sang them into mail of copper.<BR>
On the other side the vessel,<BR>
Sang he silver-tinselled maidens,<BR>
Girded them with belts of copper,<BR>
Golden rings upon their fingers.<BR>
Sings again the great magician,<BR>
Fills the magic ship with heroes,<BR>
Ancient heroes, brave and mighty;<BR>
Sings them into narrow limits,<BR>
Since the young men came before them.</P>
<P>At the helm himself be seated,<BR>
Near the last beam of the vessel,<BR>
Steered his goodly boat in joyance,<BR>
Thus addressed the willing war-ship:<BR>
"Glide upon the trackless waters,<BR>
Sail away, my ship of magic,<BR>
Sail across the waves before thee,<BR>
Speed thou like a dancing bubble,<BR>
Like a flower upon the billows!"</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Set the young men to the rowing,<BR>
Let the maidens sit in waiting.<BR>
Eagerly the youthful heroes<BR>
Bend the oars and try the row-locks,<BR>
But the distance is not lessened.<BR>
Then the minstrel, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Set the maidens to the rowing,<BR>
Let the young men rest in waiting.<BR>
Eagerly the merry maidens<BR>
Bend the aspen-oars in rowing,<BR>
But the distance is not lessened.<BR>
Then the master, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Set the old men to the rowing,<BR>
Let the youth remain in waiting.<BR>
Lustily the aged heroes<BR>
Bend and try the oars of aspen,<BR>
But the distance is not lessened.</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Grasped the oars with master-magic,<BR>
And the boat leaped o'er the surges,<BR>
Swiftly sped across the billows;<BR>
Far and wide the oars resounded,<BR>
Quickly was the distance lessened.<BR>
With a rush and roar of waters<BR>
Ilmarinen sped his vessel,<BR>
Benches, ribs, and row-locks creaking,<BR>
Oars of aspen far resounding;<BR>
Flap the sails like wings of moor-cocks,<BR>
And the prow dips like a white-swan;<BR>
In the rear it croaks like ravens,<BR>
Loud the oars and rigging rattle.</P>
<P>Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Sitting by the bending rudder,<BR>
Turns his magic vessel landward,<BR>
To a jutting promontory,<BR>
Where appears a Northland-village.<BR>
On the point stands Lemminkainen,<BR>
Kaukomieli, black magician,<BR>
Ahti, wizard of Wainola,<BR>
Wishing for the fish of Pohya,<BR>
Weeping for his fated dwelling,<BR>
For his perilous adventures,<BR>
Hard at work upon a vessel,<BR>
On the sail-yards of a fish-boat,<BR>
Near the hunger-point and island,<BR>
Near the village-home deserted.<BR>
Good the ears of the magician,<BR>
Good the wizard's eyes for seeing;<BR>
Casts his vision to the South-east,<BR>
Turns his eyes upon the sunset,<BR>
Sees afar a wondrous rainbow,<BR>
Farther on, a cloudlet hanging;<BR>
But the bow was a deception,<BR>
And the cloudlet a delusion;<BR>
'Tis a vessel swiftly sailing,<BR>
'Tis a war-ship flying northward,<BR>
O'er the blue-back of the broad-sea,<BR>
On the far-extending waters,<BR>
At the helm the master standing,<BR>
At the oars a mighty hero.<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Do not know this wondrous vessel,<BR>
Not this well-constructed war-ship,<BR>
Coming from the distant Suomi,<BR>
Rowing for the hostile Pohya."</P>
<P>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Called aloud in tones of thunder<BR>
O'er the waters to the vessel;<BR>
Made the distant hills re-echo<BR>
With the music of his calling:<BR>
"Whence this vessel on the waters,<BR>
Whose the war-ship sailing hither?"</P>
<P>Spake the master of the vessel<BR>
To the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Who art thou from fen or forest,<BR>
Senseless wizard from the woodlands,<BR>
That thou dost not know this vessel,<BR>
Magic war-ship of Wainola?<BR>
Dost not know him at the rudder,<BR>
Nor the hero at the row-locks?"<BR>
Spake the wizard, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Well I know the helm-director,<BR>
And I recognize the rower;<BR>
Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
At the helm directs the vessel;<BR>
Ilmarinen does the rowing.<BR>
Whither is the vessel sailing,<BR>
Whither wandering, my heroes?<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"We are sailing to the Northland,<BR>
There to gain the magic Sampo,<BR>
There to get the lid in colors,<BR>
From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<BR>
From the copper-bearing mountain."<BR>
Spake the evil Lemminkainen:<BR>
"O, thou good, old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Take me with thee to Pohyola,<BR>
Make me third of magic heroes,<BR>
Since thou goest for the Sampo,<BR>
Goest for the lid in colors;<BR>
I shall prove a valiant soldier,<BR>
When thy wisdom calls for fighting;<BR>
I am skilled in arts of warfare!"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Gave assent to Ahti's wishes;<BR>
Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Hastened to Wainola's war-ship,<BR>
Bringing floats of aspen-timber,<BR>
To the ships of Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>Thus the hero of the Northland<BR>
Speaks to reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"There is aspen on my vessel,<BR>
Aspen-floats in great abundance,<BR>
And the boat is heavy-laden.<BR>
Wherefore dost thou bring the aspen<BR>
To the vessel of Wainola?"<BR>
Lemminkainen gave this answer:<BR>
"Not through caution sinks a vessel,<BR>
Nor a hay-stack by its proppings;<BR>
Seas abound in hidden dangers,<BR>
Heavy storms arise and threaten<BR>
Fell destruction to the sailor<BR>
That would brave the angry billows."<BR>
Spake the good, old Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Therefore is this warlike vessel<BR>
Built of trusty steel and copper,<BR>
Trimmed and bound in toughest iron,<BR>
That the winds may, not destroy it,<BR>
May not harm my ship of magic."</P>
