<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">KULLERVO AS A SHEPERD.</H1>
<P>KULLERWOINEN, wizard-servant<BR>
Of the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Purchased slave from Untamoinen,<BR>
Magic son with sky-blue stockings.,<BR>
With a head of golden ringlets,<BR>
In his shoes of marten-leather,<BR>
Waiting little, asked the blacksmith,<BR>
Asked the host for work at morning,<BR>
In the evening asked the hostess,<BR>
These the words of Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"Give me work at early morning,<BR>
In the evening, occupation,<BR>
Labor worthy of thy servant."</P>
<P>Then the wife of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Once the Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Thinking long, and long debating,<BR>
How to give the youth employment,<BR>
How the purchased slave could labor;<BR>
Finally a shepherd made him,<BR>
Made him keeper of her pastures;<BR>
But the over-scornful hostess,<BR>
Baked a biscuit for the herdsman,<BR>
Baked a loaf of wondrous thickness,<BR>
Baked the lower-half of oat-meal,<BR>
And the upper-half of barley,<BR>
Baked a flint-stone in the centre,<BR>
Poured around it liquid butter,<BR>
Then she gave it to the shepherd,<BR>
Food to still the herdsman's hunger;<BR>
Thus she gave the youth instructions:<BR>
"Do not eat the bread in hunger,<BR>
Till the herd is in the woodlands!"</P>
<P>Then the wife of Ilmarinen<BR>
Sent her cattle to the pasture,<BR>
Thus addressing Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"Drive the cows to yonder bowers,<BR>
To the birch-trees and the aspens,<BR>
That they there may feed and fatten,<BR>
Fill themselves with milk and butter,<BR>
In the open forest-pastures,<BR>
On the distant hills and mountains,<BR>
In the glens among the birch-trees,<BR>
In the lowlands with the aspens,<BR>
In the golden pine-tree forests,<BR>
In the thickets silver-laden.</P>
<P>"Guard them, thou O kind Creator,<BR>
Shield them, omnipresent Ukko,<BR>
Shelter them from every danger,<BR>
And protect them from all evil,<BR>
That they may not want, nor wander<BR>
From the paths of peace and plenty.<BR>
As at home Thou didst protect them<BR>
In the shelters and the hurdles,<BR>
Guard them now beneath the heavens,<BR>
Shelter them in woodland pastures,<BR>
That the herds may live and prosper<BR>
To 'the joy of Northland's hostess,<BR>
And against the will of Lempo.</P>
<P>"If my herdsman prove unworthy,<BR>
If the shepherd-maids seem evil,<BR>
Let the pastures be their shepherds,<BR>
Let the alders guard the cattle,<BR>
Make the birch-tree their protector,<BR>
Let the willow drive them homeward,<BR>
Ere the hostess go to seek them,<BR>
Ere the milkmaids wait and worry.<BR>
Should the birch-tree not protect them,<BR>
Nor the aspen lend assistance,<BR>
Nor the linden be their keeper,<BR>
Nor the willow drive them homeward,<BR>
Wilt thou give them better herdsmen,<BR>
Let Creation's beauteous daughters<BR>
Be their kindly shepherdesses.<BR>
Thou hast many lovely maidens,<BR>
Many hundreds that obey thee,<BR>
In the Ether's spacious circles,<BR>
Beauteous daughters of creation.</P>
<P>"Summer-daughter, magic maiden,<BR>
Southern mother of the woodlands,<BR>
Pine-tree daughter, Kateyatar,<BR>
Pihlayatar, of the aspen,<BR>
Alder-maiden, Tapio's daughter,<BR>
Daughter of the glen, Millikki,<BR>
And the mountain-maid, Tellervo,<BR>
Of my herds be ye protectors,<BR>
Keep them from the evil-minded,<BR>
Keep them safe in days of summer,<BR>
In the times of fragrant flowers,<BR>
While the tender leaves are whispering,<BR>
While the Earth is verdure-laden.</P>
<P>"Summer-daughter, charming maiden,<BR>
Southern mother of the woodlands,<BR>
Spread abroad thy robes of safety,<BR>
Spread thine apron o'er the forest,<BR>
Let it cover all my cattle,<BR>
And protect the unprotected,<BR>
That no evil winds may harm them,<BR>
May not suffer from the storm-clouds.<BR>
Guard my flocks from every danger,<BR>
Keep them from the hands of wild-beasts,<BR>
From the swamps with sinking pathways,<BR>
From the springs that bubble trouble,<BR>
From the swiftly running waters,<BR>
From the bottom of the whirlpool,<BR>
That they may not find misfortune,<BR>
May not wander to destruction,<BR>
In the marshes sink and perish,<BR>
Though against God's best intentions,<BR>
Though against the will of Ukko.</P>
<P>"From a distance bring a bugle,<BR>
Bring a shepherd's horn from heaven,<BR>
Bring the honey-flute of Ukko,<BR>
Play the music of creation,<BR>
Blow the pipes of the magician,<BR>
Play the flowers on the highlands,<BR>
Charm the hills, and dales, and mount<BR>
Charm the borders of the forest,<BR>
Fill the forest-trees with honey,<BR>
Fill with spice the fountain-borders.</P>
<P>"For my herds give food and shelter,<BR>
Feed them all on honeyed pastures,<BR>
Give them drink at honeyed fountains<BR>
Feed them on thy golden grasses,<BR>
On the leaves of silver saplings,<BR>
From the springs of life and beauty,<BR>
From the crystal-waters flowing,<BR>
From the waterfalls of Rutya,<BR>
From the uplands green and golden,<BR>
From the glens enriched in silver.<BR>
Dig thou also golden fountains<BR>
On the four sides of the willow,<BR>
That the cows may drink in sweetness,<BR>
And their udders swell with honey,<BR>
That their milk may flow in streamlets;<BR>
Let the milk be caught in vessels,<BR>
Let the cow's gift be not wasted,<BR>
Be not given to Manala.</P>
<P>"Many are the sons of evil,<BR>
That to Mana take their milkings,<BR>
Give their milk to evil-doers,<BR>
Waste it in Tuoni's empire;<BR>
Few there are, and they the worthy,<BR>
That can get the milk from Mana;<BR>
Never did my ancient mother<BR>
Ask for counsel in the village,<BR>
Never in the courts for wisdom;<BR>
She obtained her milk from Mana,<BR>
Took the sour-milk from the dealers,<BR>
Sweet-milk from the greater distance,<BR>
From the kingdom of Manala,<BR>
From Tuoni's fields and pastures;<BR>
Brought it in the dusk of evening,<BR>
Through the by-ways in the darkness,<BR>
That the wicked should not know it,<BR>
That it should not find destruction.</P>
<P>"This the language of my mother,<BR>
And these words I also echo:<BR>
Whither does the cow's gift wander,<BR>
Whither has the milk departed?<BR>
Has it gone to feed the strangers,<BR>
Banished to the distant village,<BR>
Gone to feed the hamlet-lover,<BR>
Or perchance to feed the forest,<BR>
Disappeared within the woodlands,<BR>
Scattered o'er the hills and mountains,<BR>
Mingled with the lakes and rivers?<BR>
It shall never go to Mana,<BR>
Never go to feed the stranger,<BR>
Never to the village-lover;<BR>
Neither shall it feed the forest,<BR>
Nor be lost upon the mountains,<BR>
Neither sprinkled in the woodlands,<BR>
Nor be mingled with the waters;<BR>
It is needed for our tables,<BR>
Worthy food for all our children.'</P>
<P>Summer-daughter, maid of beauty,<BR>
Southern daughter of Creation,<BR>
Give Suotikki tender fodder,<BR>
To Watikki, give pure water,<BR>
To Hermikki milk abundant,<BR>
Fresh provisions to Tuorikki,<BR>
From Mairikki let the milk flow,<BR>
Fresh milk from my cows in plenty,<BR>
Coming from the tips of grasses,<BR>
From the tender herbs and leaflets,<BR>
From the meadows rich in honey,<BR>
From the mother of the forest,<BR>
From the meadows sweetly dripping,<BR>
From the berry-laden branches,<BR>
From the heath of flower-maidens,<BR>
From the verdure. maiden bowers,<BR>
From the clouds of milk-providers,<BR>
From the virgin of the heavens,<BR>
That the milk may flow abundant<BR>
From the cows that I have given<BR>
To the keeping of Kullervo.</P>
<P>"Rise thou virgin of the valley,<BR>
From the springs arise in beauty,<BR>
Rise thou maiden of the fountain,<BR>
Beautiful, arise in ether,<BR>
Take the waters from the cloudlets,<BR>
And my roaming herds besprinkle,<BR>
That my cows may drink and flourish,<BR>
May be ready for the coming<BR>
Of the shepherdess of evening.</P>
<P>"O Millikki, forest-hostess,<BR>
Mother of the herds at pasture,<BR>
Send the tallest of thy servants,<BR>
Send the best of thine assistants,<BR>
That my herds may well be guarded,<BR>
Through the pleasant days of summer,<BR>
Given us by our Creator.</P>
<P>"Beauteous virgin of the woodlands,<BR>
Tapio's most charming daughter,<BR>
Fair Tellervo, forest-maiden,<BR>
Softly clad in silken raiment,<BR>
Beautiful in golden ringlets,<BR>
Do thou give my herds protection,<BR>
In the Metsola dominions,<BR>
On the hills of Tapiola;<BR>
Shield them with thy hands of beauty,<BR>
Stroke them gently with thy fingers,<BR>
Give to them a golden lustre,<BR>
Make them shine like fins of salmon,<BR>
Grow them robes as soft as ermine.</P>
<P>"When the evening star brings darkness,<BR>
When appears the hour of twilight,<BR>
Send my lowing cattle homeward,<BR>
Milk within their vessels coursing,<BR>
Water on their backs in lakelets.<BR>
When the Sun has set in ocean,<BR>
When the evening-bird is singing,<BR>
Thus address my herds of cattle:</P>
<P>"Ye that carry horns, now hasten<BR>
To the sheds of Ilmarinen;<BR>
Ye enriched in milk go homeward,<BR>
To the hostess now in waiting,<BR>
Home, the better place for sleeping,<BR>
Forest-beds are full of danger;<BR>
When the evening comes in darkness,<BR>
Straightway journey to the milkmaids<BR>
Building fires to light the pathway<BR>
On the turf enriched in honey,<BR>
In the pastures berry-laden!</P>
<P>"Thou, O Tapio's son, Nyrikki,<BR>
Forest-son, enrobed in purple,<BR>
Cut the fir-trees on the mountains,<BR>
Cut the pines with cones of beauty,<BR>
Lay them o'er the streams for bridges,<BR>
Cover well the sloughs of quicksand,<BR>
In the swamps and in the lowlands,<BR>
That my herd may pass in safety,<BR>
On their long and dismal journey,<BR>
To the clouds of smoke may hasten,<BR>
Where the milkmaids wait their coming.<BR>
If the cows heed not this order,<BR>
Do not hasten home at evening,<BR>
Then, O service-berry maiden,<BR>
Cut a birch-rod from the glenwood,<BR>
From the juniper, a whip-stick,<BR>
Near to Tapio's spacious mansion,<BR>
Standing on the ash-tree mountain,<BR>
Drive my wayward, ]owing cattle,<BR>
Into Metsola's wide milk-yards,<BR>
When the evening-star is rising.</P>
<P>"Thou, O Otso, forest-apple,<BR>
Woodland bear, with honeyed fingers,<BR>
Let us make a lasting treaty,<BR>
Make a vow for future ages,<BR>
That thou wilt not kill my cattle,<BR>
Wilt not eat my milk-providers;<BR>
That I will not send my hunters<BR>
To destroy thee and thy kindred,<BR>
Never in the days of summer,<BR>
The Creator's warmest season.</P>
<P>"Dost thou hear the tones of cow-bells,<BR>
Hear the calling of the bugles,<BR>
Ride thyself within the meadow,<BR>
Sink upon the turf in slumber,<BR>
Bury both thine ears in clover,<BR>
Crouch within some alder-thicket<BR>
Climb between the mossy ledges,<BR>
Visit thou some rocky cavern,<BR>
Flee away to other mountains,<BR>
Till thou canst not hear the cow-bells,<BR>
Nor the calling of the herdsmen.</P>
<P>"Listen, Otso of the woodlands,<BR>
Sacred bear with honeyed fingers,<BR>
To approach the herd of cattle<BR>
Thou thyself art not forbidden,<BR>
But thy tongue, and teeth, and fingers,<BR>
Must not touch my herd in summer,<BR>
Must not harm my harmless creatures.<BR>
Go around the scented meadows,<BR>
Amble through the milky pastures,<BR>
From the tones of bells and shepherds.<BR>
should the herd be on the mountain,<BR>
Go thou quickly to the marshes;<BR>
Should my cattle browse the lowlands,<BR>
Sleep thou then within the thicket;<BR>
Should they feed upon the uplands,<BR>
Thou must hasten to the valley;<BR>
Should the herd graze at the bottom,<BR>
Thou must feed upon the summit.</P>
<P>"Wander like the golden cuckoo,<BR>
Like the dove of silver brightness,<BR>
Like a little fish in ocean;<BR>
Ride thy claws within thy hair-foot,<BR>
Shut thy wicked teeth in darkness,<BR>
That my herd may not be frightened,<BR>
May not think themselves in danger.<BR>
Leave my cows in peace and plenty,<BR>
Let them journey home in order,<BR>
Through the vales and mountain by-ways,<BR>
Over plains and through the forest,<BR>
Harming not my harmless creatures.</P>
<P>"Call to mind our former pledges,<BR>
At the river of Tuoni,<BR>
Near the waterfall and whirlpool,<BR>
In the ears of our Creator.<BR>
Thrice to Otso was it granted,<BR>
In the circuit of the summer,<BR>
To approach the land of cow-bells,<BR>
Where the herdsmen's voices echo;<BR>
But to thee it was not granted,<BR>
Otso never had permission<BR>
To attempt a wicked action,<BR>
To begin a work of evil.<BR>
Should the blinding thing of malice<BR>
Come upon thee in thy roamings,<BR>
Should thy bloody teeth feel hunger,<BR>
Throw thy malice to the mountains,<BR>
And thy hunger to the pine-trees,<BR>
Sink thy teeth within the aspens,<BR>
In the dead limbs of the birches,<BR>
Prune the dry stalks from the willows.<BR>
Should thy hunger still impel thee,<BR>
Go thou to the berry-mountain,<BR>
Eat the fungus of the forest,<BR>
Feed thy hunger on the ant-hills,<BR>
Eat the red roots of the bear-tree,<BR>
Metsola's rich cakes of honey,<BR>
Not the grass my herd would feed on.<BR>
Or if Metsola's rich honey<BR>
Should ferment before the eating,<BR>
On the hills of golden color,<BR>
On the mountains filled with silver,<BR>
There is other food for hunger,<BR>
Other drink for thirsting Otso,<BR>
Everlasting will the food be,<BR>
And the drink be never wanting.</P>
<P>"Let us now agree in honor,<BR>
And conclude a lasting treaty<BR>
That our lives may end in pleasure,<BR>
May be, merry in the summer,<BR>
Both enjoy the woods in common,<BR>
Though our food must be distinctive<BR>
Shouldst thou still desire to fight me,<BR>
Let our contests be in winter,<BR>
Let our wars be, on the snow-fields.<BR>
Swamps will thaw in days of summer,<BR>
Warm, the water in the rivers.<BR>
Therefore shouldst thou break this treaty,<BR>
Shouldst thou come where golden cattle<BR>
Roam these woodland hills and valleys,<BR>
We will slay thee with our cross-bows;<BR>
Should our arrow-men be absent,<BR>
We have here some archer-women,<BR>
And among them is the hostess,<BR>
That can use the fatal weapon,<BR>
That can bring thee to destruction,<BR>
Thus will end the days of trouble<BR>
That thou bringest to our people,<BR>
And against the will of Ukko.</P>
<P>"Ukko, ruler in the heavens,<BR>
Lend an ear to my entreaty,<BR>
Metamorphose all my cattle,<BR>
Through the mighty force of magic,<BR>
Into stumps and stones convert them,<BR>
If the enemy should wander,<BR>
Near my herd in days of summer.</P>
<P>"If I had been born an Otso,<BR>
I would never stride and amble<BR>
At the feet of aged women;<BR>
Elsewhere there are hills and valleys,<BR>
Farther on are honey-pastures,<BR>
Where the lazy bear may wander,<BR>
Where the indolent may linger;<BR>
Sneak away to yonder mountain,<BR>
That thy tender flesh may lessen,<BR>
In the blue-glen's deep recesses,<BR>
In the bear-dens of the forest,<BR>
Thou canst move through fields of acorns,<BR>
Through the sand and ocean-pebbles,<BR>
There for thee is tracked a pathway,<BR>
Through the woodlands on the sea-coast,<BR>
To the Northland's farthest limits,<BR>
To the dismal plains of Lapland,<BR>
There 'tis well for thee to lumber,<BR>
There to live will be a pleasure.<BR>
Shoeless there to walk in summer,<BR>
Stockingless in days of autumn,<BR>
On the blue-back of the mountain,<BR>
Through the swamps and fertile lowlands.</P>
<P>"If thou canst not journey thither,<BR>
Canst not find the Lapland-highway,<BR>
Hasten on a little distance,<BR>
In the bear-path leading northward.<BR>
To the grove of Tuonela,<BR>
To the honey-plains of Kalma,<BR>
Swamps there are in which to wander,<BR>
Heaths in which to roam at pleasure,<BR>
There are Kiryos, there are Karyos,<BR>
And of beasts a countless number,<BR>
With their fetters strong as iron,<BR>
Fattening within the forest.<BR>
Be ye gracious, groves and mountains,<BR>
Full of grace, ye darksome thickets,<BR>
Peace and, plenty to my cattle,<BR>
Through the pleasant days of summer,<BR>
The Creator's warmest season.</P>
<P>"Knippana, O King of forests,<BR>
Thou the gray-beard of the woodlands,<BR>
Watch thy dogs in fen and fallow,<BR>
Lay a sponge within one nostril,<BR>
And an acorn in the other,<BR>
That they may not scent my cattle;<BR>
Tie their eyes with silken fillets,<BR>
That they may not see my herdlings,<BR>
May not see my cattle grazing.</P>
<P>"Should all this seem inefficient,<BR>
Drive away thy barking children,<BR>
Let them run to other forests,<BR>
Let them hunt in other marshes,<BR>
From these verdant strips of meadow,<BR>
From these far outstretching borders,<BR>
Hide thy dogs within thy caverns,<BR>
Firmly tie thy yelping children,<BR>
Tie them with thy golden fetters,<BR>
With thy chains adorned with silver,<BR>
That they may not do me damage,'<BR>
May not do a deed of mischief.<BR>
Should all this prove inefficient,<BR>
Thou, O Ukko, King of heaven.<BR>
Wise director, full of mercy,<BR>
Hear the golden words I utter,<BR>
Hear a voice that breathes affection,<BR>
From the alder make a muzzle,<BR>
For each dog, within the kennel;<BR>
Should the alder prove too feeble,<BR>
Cast a band of purest copper;<BR>
Should the copper prove a failure,<BR>
Forge a band of ductile iron;<BR>
Should the iron snap asunder,<BR>
In each nose a small-ring fasten,<BR>
Made of molten gold and silver,<BR>
Chain thy dogs in forest-caverns,<BR>
That my herd may not be injured.</P>
<P>Then the wife of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Life-companion of the blacksmith,<BR>
Opened all her yards and stables,<BR>
Led her herd across the meadow,<BR>
Placed them in the herdman's keeping,<BR>
In the care of Kullerwoinen.</P>
