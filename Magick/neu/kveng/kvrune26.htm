<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">ORIGIN OF THE SERPENT.</H1>
<P>AHTI, living on the island, <BR>
Near the Kauko-point and harbor,<BR>
Plowed his fields for rye and barley,<BR>
Furrowed his extensive pastures,<BR>
Heard with quickened ears an uproar,<BR>
Heard the village in commotion,<BR>
Heard a noise along the sea-shore,<BR>
Heard the foot-steps on the ice-plain,<BR>
Heard the rattle of the sledges;<BR>
Quick his mind divined the reason,<BR>
Knew it was Pohyola's wedding,<BR>
Wedding of the Rainbow-virgin.<BR>
Quick he stopped in disappointment,<BR>
Shook his sable locks in envy,<BR>
Turned his hero-head in anger,<BR>
While the scarlet blood ceased flowing<BR>
Through his pallid face and temples;<BR>
Ceased his plowing and his sowing,<BR>
On the field he left the furrows,<BR>
On his steed he lightly mounted,<BR>
Straightway galloped fleetly homeward<BR>
To his well-beloved mother,<BR>
To his mother old and golden,<BR>
Gave his mother these directions,<BR>
These the words of Lemminkainen:<BR>
"My beloved, faithful mother,<BR>
Quickly bring me beer and viands,<BR>
Bring me food for I am hungry,<BR>
Food and drink for me abundant,<BR>
Have my bath-room quickly heated,<BR>
Quickly set the room in order,<BR>
That I may refresh my body,<BR>
Dress myself in hero-raiment."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen's aged mother<BR>
Brings her hero food in plenty,<BR>
Beer and viands for the hungry,<BR>
For her thirsting son and hero;<BR>
Quick she heats the ancient bath-room,<BR>
Quickly sets his bath in order.</P>
<P>Then the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
Ate his meat with beer inspiring,<BR>
Hastened to his bath awaiting;<BR>
Only was the bullfinch bathing,<BR>
With the many-colored bunting;<BR>
Quick the hero laved his temples,<BR>
Laved himself to flaxen whiteness,<BR>
Quick returning to his mother,<BR>
Spake in haste the words that follow:<BR>
"My beloved, helpful mother,<BR>
Go at once to yonder mountain,<BR>
To the store-house on the hill-top,<BR>
Bring my vest of finest texture,<BR>
Bring my hero-coat of purple,<BR>
Bring my suit of magic colors,<BR>
Thus to make me look attractive,<BR>
Thus to robe myself in beauty."</P>
<P>First the ancient mother asked him,<BR>
Asked her son this simple question:<BR>
"Whither dost thou go, my hero?<BR>
Dost thou go to hunt the roebuck,<BR>
Chase the lynx upon the mountains,<BR>
Shoot the squirrel in the woodlands?"</P>
<P>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Also known as Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Worthy mother of my being,<BR>
Go I not to hunt the roebuck,<BR>
Chase the lynx upon the mountains,<BR>
Shoot the squirrel on the tree-tops;<BR>
I am going to Pohyola,<BR>
To the feasting of her people.<BR>
Bring at once my purple vestments,<BR>
Straightway bring my nuptial outfit,<BR>
Let me don it for the marriage<BR>
Of the maiden of the Northland."</P>
<P>But the ancient dame dissented,<BR>
And the wife forebade the husband;<BR>
Two of all the best of heroes,<BR>
Three of nature's fairest daughters,<BR>
Strongly urged wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Not to go to Sariola,<BR>
To Pohyola's great carousal,<BR>
To the marriage-feast of Northland,<BR>
"Since thou hast not been invited,<BR>
Since they do not wish thy presence."</P>
<P>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen.<BR>
These the words of Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Where the wicked are invited,<BR>
There the good are always welcome,<BR>
Herein lies my invitation;<BR>
I am constantly reminded<BR>
By this sword of sharpened edges,<BR>
By this magic blade and scabbard,<BR>
That Pohyola needs my presence."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen's aged mother<BR>
Sought again to stay her hero:<BR>
"Do not go, my son beloved,<BR>
To the feasting in Pohyola;<BR>
Full of horrors are the highways,<BR>
On the road are many wonders,<BR>
Three times Death appears to frighten,<BR>
Thrice destruction hovers over!"</P>
<P>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
These the words of Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Death is seen by aged people,<BR>
Everywhere they see perdition,<BR>
Death can never frighten heroes,<BR>
Heroes do not fear the spectre;<BR>
Be that as it may, dear mother,<BR>
Tell that I may understand thee,<BR>
Name the first of all destructions,<BR>
Name the first and last destroyers!"<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"I will tell thee, son and hero,<BR>
Not because I wish to speak it,<BR>
But because the truth is worthy;<BR>
I will name the chief destruction,<BR>
Name the first of the destroyers.<BR>
When thou hast a distance journeyed,<BR>
Only one day hast thou travelled,<BR>
Comes a stream along the highway,<BR>
Stream of fire of wondrous beauty,<BR>
In the stream a mighty fire-spout,<BR>
In the spout a rock uprising,<BR>
On the rock a fiery hillock,<BR>
On the top a flaming eagle,<BR>
And his crooked beak he sharpens,<BR>
Sharpens too his bloody talons,<BR>
For the coming of the stranger,<BR>
For the people that approach him."</P>
<P>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Women die beneath the eagle,<BR>
Such is not the death of heroes;<BR>
Know I well a magic lotion,<BR>
That will heal the wounds of eagles;<BR>
Make myself a steed of alders,<BR>
That will walk as my companion,<BR>
That will stride ahead majestic;<BR>
As a duck I'll drive behind him,<BR>
Drive him o'er the fatal waters,<BR>
Underneath the flaming eagle,<BR>
With his bloody beak and talons.<BR>
Worthy mother of my being,<BR>
Name the second of destroyers."<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"This the second of destroyers:<BR>
When thou hast a distance wandered,<BR>
Only two clays hast thou travelled,<BR>
Comes a pit of fire to meet thee,<BR>
In the centre of the highway,<BR>
Eastward far the pit extending,<BR>
Stretches endless to the westward,<BR>
Filled with burning coals and pebbles,<BR>
Glowing with the heat of ages;<BR>
Hundreds has this monster swallowed,<BR>
In his jaws have thousands perished,<BR>
Hundreds with their trusty broadswords,<BR>
Thousands on their fiery chargers."</P>
<P>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Never will the hero perish<BR>
In the jaws of such a monster;<BR>
Know I well the means of safety,<BR>
Know a remedy efficient:<BR>
I will make of snow a master,<BR>
On the snow-clad fields, a hero,<BR>
Drive the snow-man on before me,<BR>
Drive him through the flaming vortex,<BR>
Drive him through the fiery furnace,<BR>
With my magic broom of copper;<BR>
I will follow in his shadow,<BR>
Follow close the magic image,<BR>
Thus escape the frightful monster,<BR>
With my golden locks uninjured,<BR>
With my flowing beard untangled.<BR>
Ancient mother of my being,<BR>
Name the last of the destructions,<BR>
Name the third of the destroyers."<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"This the third of fatal dangers:<BR>
Hast thou gone a greater distance,<BR>
Hast thou travelled one day longer,<BR>
To the portals of Pohyola,<BR>
To the narrowest of gate-ways,<BR>
There a wolf will rise to meet thee,<BR>
There the black-bear sneak upon thee-,<BR>
In Pohyola's darksome portals,<BR>
Hundreds in their jaws have perished,<BR>
Have devoured a thousand heroes;<BR>
Wherefore will they not destroy thee,<BR>
Since thy form is unprotected?"</P>
<P>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Let them eat the gentle lambkins,<BR>
Feed upon their tender tissues,<BR>
They cannot devour this hero;<BR>
I am girded with my buckler,<BR>
Girded with my belt of copper,<BR>
Armlets wear I of the master,<BR>
From the wolf and bear protected,<BR>
Will not hasten to Untamo.<BR>
I can meet the wolf of Lempo,<BR>
For the bear I have a balsam,<BR>
For his mouth I conjure bridles,<BR>
For the wolf, forge chains of iron;<BR>
I will smite them as the willow,<BR>
Chop them into little fragments,<BR>
Thus I'll gain the open court-yard,<BR>
Thus triumphant end my journey."<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"Then thy journey is not ended,<BR>
Greater dangers still await thee,<BR>
Great the wonders yet before thee,<BR>
Horrors three within thy pathway;<BR>
Three great dangers of the hero<BR>
Still await thy reckless footsteps,<BR>
These the worst of all thy dangers:<BR>
When thou hast still farther wandered,<BR>
Thou wilt reach the Court of Pohya,<BR>
Where the walls are forged from iron,<BR>
And from steel the outer bulwark;<BR>
Rises from the earth to heaven,<BR>
Back again to earth returning;<BR>
Double spears are used for railings,<BR>
On each spear are serpents winding,<BR>
On each rail are stinging adders;<BR>
Lizards too adorn the bulwarks,<BR>
Play their long tails in the sunlight,<BR>
Hissing lizards, venomed serpents,<BR>
Jump and writhe upon the rampart,<BR>
Turn their horrid heads to meet thee;<BR>
On the greensward lie the monsters,<BR>
On the ground the things of evil,<BR>
With their pliant tongues of venom,<BR>
Hissing, striking, crawling, writhing;<BR>
One more horrid than the others,<BR>
Lies before the fatal gate-way,<BR>
Longer than the longest rafters,<BR>
Larger than the largest portals;<BR>
Hisses with the tongue of anger,<BR>
Lifts his head in awful menace,<BR>
Raises it to strike none other<BR>
Than the hero of the islands."</P>
<P>Spake the warlike Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<BR>
"By such things the children perish,<BR>
Such is not the death of heroes;<BR>
Know I well the fire to manage,<BR>
I can quench the flames of passion,<BR>
I can meet the prowling wild-beasts,<BR>
Can appease the wrath of serpents,<BR>
I can heal the sting of adders,<BR>
I have plowed the serpent-pastures,<BR>
Plowed the adder-fields of Northland;<BR>
While my hands were unprotected,<BR>
Held the serpents in my fingers,<BR>
Drove the adders to Manala,<BR>
On my hands the blood of serpents,<BR>
On my feet the fat of adders.<BR>
Never will thy hero stumble<BR>
On the serpents of the Northland;<BR>
With my heel I'll crush the monsters,<BR>
Stamp the horrid things to atoms;<BR>
I will banish them from Pohya,<BR>
Drive them to Manala's kingdom,<BR>
Step within Pohyola's mansion,<BR>
Walk the halls of Sariola!"<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"Do not go, my son beloved,<BR>
To the firesides of Pohyola,<BR>
Through the Northland fields and fallows;<BR>
There are warriors with broadswords,<BR>
Heroes clad in mail of copper,<BR>
Are on beer intoxicated,<BR>
By the beer are much embittered;<BR>
They will charm thee, hapless creature,<BR>
On the tips of swords of magic;<BR>
Greater heroes have been conjured,<BR>
Stronger ones have been outwitted."<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Formerly thy son resided<BR>
In the hamlets of Pohyola;<BR>
Laplanders cannot enchant me,<BR>
Nor the Turyalanders harm me<BR>
I the, Laplander will conjure,<BR>
Charm him with my magic powers,<BR>
Sing his shoulders wide asunder,<BR>
In his chin I'll sing a fissure,<BR>
Sing his collar-bone to pieces,<BR>
Sing his breast to thousand fragments."<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"Foolish son, ungrateful wizard,<BR>
Boasting of thy former visit,<BR>
Boasting of thy fatal journey!<BR>
Once in Northland thou wert living,<BR>
In the homesteads of Pohyola;<BR>
There thou tried to swim the whirlpool,<BR>
Tasted there the dog-tongue waters,<BR>
Floated down the fatal current,<BR>
Sank beneath its angry billows;<BR>
Thou hast seen Tuoni's river,<BR>
Thou hast measured Mana's waters,<BR>
There to-day thou wouldst be sleeping,<BR>
Had it not been for thy mother!<BR>
What I tell thee well remember,<BR>
Shouldst thou gain Pohyola's chambers,<BR>
Filled with stakes thou'lt find the court-yard,<BR>
These to hold the heads of heroes;<BR>
There thy head will rest forever,<BR>
Shouldst thou go to Sariola."<BR>
Spake the warlike Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Fools indeed may heed thy counsel,<BR>
Cowards too may give attention;<BR>
Those of seven conquest-summers<BR>
Cannot heed such weak advising.<BR>
Bring to me my battle-armor.<BR>
Bring my magic mail of copper,<BR>
Bring me too my father's broadsword,<BR>
Keep the old man's blade from rusting;<BR>
Long it has been cold and idle,<BR>
Long has lain in secret places,<BR>
Long and constantly been weeping,<BR>
Long been asking for a bearer."</P>
<P>Then he took his mail of copper,<BR>
Took his ancient battle-armor,<BR>
Took his father's sword of magic,<BR>
Tried its point against the oak-wood,<BR>
Tried its edge upon the sorb-tree;<BR>
In his hand the blade was bended,<BR>
Like the limber boughs of willow,<BR>
Like the juniper in summer.<BR>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"There is none in Pohya's hamlets,<BR>
In the courts of Sariola,<BR>
That with me can measure broadswords,<BR>
That can meet this blade ancestral."</P>
<P>From the nail he took a cross-bow,<BR>
Took the strongest from the rafters,<BR>
Spake these words in meditation:<BR>
"I shall recognize as worthy,<BR>
Recognize that one a hero<BR>
That can bend this mighty cross-bow,<BR>
That can break its magic sinews,<BR>
In the hamlets of Pohyola."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, filled with courage,<BR>
Girds himself in suit of battle,<BR>
Dons his mighty mail of copper,<BR>
To his servant speaks as follows:<BR>
"Trusty slave, and whom I purchased,<BR>
Whom I bought with gold and silver,<BR>
Quick prepare my fiery charger,<BR>
Harness well my steed of battle;<BR>
I am going to the feasting,<BR>
To the banquet-fields of Lempo."</P>
<P>Quick obeys the faithful servant,<BR>
Hitches well the noble war-horse,<BR>
Quick prepares the fire-red stallion,<BR>
Speaks these words when all is I ready:<BR>
"I have done what thou hast hidden,<BR>
Ready harnessed is the charger,<BR>
Waiting to obey his master."<BR>
Comes the hour of the departing<BR>
Of the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Right hand ready, left unwilling,<BR>
All his anxious fingers pain him,<BR>
Till at last in full obedience,<BR>
All his members give permission;<BR>
Starts the hero on his journey,<BR>
While the mother gives him counsel,<BR>
At the threshold of the dwelling,<BR>
At the highway of the court-yard:<BR>
"Child of courage, my beloved,<BR>
Son of strength, my wisdom-hero,<BR>
If thou goest to the feasting,<BR>
Shouldst thou reach the great carousal,<BR>
Drink thou only a half a cupful,<BR>
Drink the goblet to the middle,<BR>
Always give the half remaining,<BR>
Give the worse half to another,<BR>
To another more unworthy;<BR>
In the lower half are serpents,<BR>
Worms, and frogs, and hissing lizards,<BR>
Feeding on the slimy bottom."</P>
<P>Furthermore she tells her hero,<BR>
Gives her son these sage directions,<BR>
On the border of the court-yard,<BR>
At the portals farthest distant:<BR>
"If thou goest to the banquet,<BR>
Shouldst thou reach the great carousal,<BR>
Occupy but half the settle,<BR>
Take but half a stride in walking,<BR>
Give the second half to others,<BR>
To another less deserving;<BR>
Only thus thou'lt be a hero,<BR>
Thus become a son immortal;<BR>
In the guest-rooms look courageous,<BR>
Bravely move about the chambers,<BR>
In the gatherings of heroes,<BR>
With the hosts of magic valor."</P>
<P>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Quickly leaped upon the cross-bench<BR>
Of his battle-sledge of wonder,<BR>
Raised his pearl-enamelled birch-rod,<BR>
Snapped his whip above his charger,<BR>
And the steed flew onward fleetly,<BR>
Galloped on his distant journey.</P>
<P>He had travelled little distance,<BR>
When a flight of hazel-chickens<BR>
Quick arose before his coming,<BR>
Flew before the foaming racer.<BR>
There were left some feathers lying,<BR>
Feathers of the hazel-chickens,<BR>
Lying in the hero's pathway.<BR>
These the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
Gathered for their magic virtues,<BR>
Put them in his pouch of leather,<BR>
Did not know what things might happen<BR>
On his journey to Pohyola;<BR>
All things have some little value,<BR>
In a strait all things are useful.</P>
<P>Then he drove a little distance,<BR>
Galloped farther on the highway,<BR>
When his courser neighed in danger,<BR>
And the fleet-foot ceased his running.<BR>
Then the stout-heart, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Rose upon his seat in wonder,<BR>
Craned his neck and looked about him<BR>
Found it as his mother told him,<BR>
Found a stream of fire opposing;<BR>
Ran the fire-stream like a river,<BR>
Ran across the hero's pathway.<BR>
In the river was a fire-fall,<BR>
In the cataract a fire-rock,<BR>
On the rock a fiery hillock,<BR>
On its summit perched an eagle,<BR>
From his throat the fire was streaming<BR>
To the crater far below him,<BR>
Fire out-shooting from his feathers,<BR>
Glowing with a fiery splendor;<BR>
Long he looked upon the hero,<BR>
Long he gazed on Lemminkainen,<BR>
Then the eagle thus addressed him:<BR>
"Whither art thou driving, Ahti,<BR>
Whither going, Lemminkainen?"<BR>
Kaukomieli spake in answer:<BR>
"To the feastings of Pohyola,<BR>
To the drinking-halls of Louhi,<BR>
To the banquet of her people;<BR>
Move aside and let me journey,<BR>
Move a little from my pathway,<BR>
Let this wanderer pass by thee,<BR>
I am warlike Lemminkainen."</P>
<P>This the answer of the eagle,<BR>
Screaming from his throat of splendor:<BR>
"Though thou art wild Lemminkainen,<BR>
I shall let thee wander onward,<BR>
Through my fire-throat let thee journey,<BR>
Through these flames shall be thy passage<BR>
To the banquet-halls of Louhi,<BR>
To Pohyola's great carousal!"</P>
<P>Little heeding, Kaukomieli<BR>
Thinks himself in little trouble,<BR>
Thrusts his fingers in his pockets,<BR>
Searches in his pouch of leather,<BR>
Quickly takes the magic feathers,<BR>
Feathers from the hazel-chickens,<BR>
Rubs them into finest powder,<BR>
Rubs them with his magic fingers<BR>
Whence a flight of birds arises,<BR>
Hazel-chickens from the feathers,<BR>
Large the bevy of the young birds.<BR>
Quick the wizard, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Drives them to the eagle's fire-mouth,<BR>
Thus to satisfy his hunger,<BR>
Thus to quench the fire out-streaming.<BR>
Thus escapes the reckless hero,<BR>
Thus escapes the first of dangers,<BR>
Passes thus the first destroyer,<BR>
On his journey to Pohyola.</P>
<P>With his whip he strikes his courser,<BR>
With his birch-whip, pearl-enamelled;<BR>
Straightway speeds the fiery charger,<BR>
Noiselessly upon his journey,<BR>
Gallops fast and gallops faster,<BR>
Till the flying steed in terror<BR>
Neighs again and ceases running.<BR>
Lemminkainen, quickly rising,<BR>
Cranes his neck and looks about him,<BR>
Sees his mother's words were truthful,<BR>
Sees her augury well-taken.<BR>
Lo! before him yawned a fire-gulf,<BR>
Stretching crosswise through his pathway;<BR>
Far to east the gulf extending,<BR>
To the west an endless distance,<BR>
Filled with stones and burning pebbles,<BR>
Running streams of burning matter.</P>
<P>Little heeding, Lemminkainen<BR>
Cries aloud in prayer to Ukko:<BR>
"Ukko, thou O God above me,<BR>
Dear Creator, omnipresent,<BR>
From the north-west send a storm-cloud,<BR>
From the east, dispatch a second,<BR>
From the south send forth a third one;<BR>
Let them gather from the south-west,<BR>
Sew their edges well together,<BR>
Fill thou well the interspaces,<BR>
Send a snow-fall high as heaven,<BR>
Let it fall from upper ether,<BR>
Fall upon the flaming fire-pit,<BR>
On the cataract and whirlpool!"</P>
<P>Mighty Ukko, the Creator,<BR>
Ukko, father omnipresent,<BR>
Dwelling in the courts of heaven,<BR>
Sent a storm-cloud from the north-west,<BR>
From the east he sent a second,<BR>
From the south despatched a third one,<BR>
Let them gather from the south-west,<BR>
Sewed their edges well together,<BR>
Filled their many interspaces,<BR>
Sent a snow-fall high as heaven,<BR>
From the giddy heights of ether,<BR>
Sent it seething to the fire-pit,<BR>
On the streams of burning matter;<BR>
From the snow-fall in the fire-pond,<BR>
Grows a lake with rolling billows.<BR>
Quick the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Conjures there of ice a passage<BR>
From one border to the other,<BR>
Thus escapes his second danger,<BR>
Thus his second trouble passes.</P>
<P>Then the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
Raised his pearl-enamelled birch-rod,<BR>
Snapped his whip above his racer,<BR>
And the steed flew onward swiftly,<BR>
Galloped on his distant journey<BR>
O'er the highway to Pohyola;<BR>
Galloped fast and galloped faster,<BR>
Galloped on a greater distance,<BR>
When the stallion loudly neighing,<BR>
Stopped and trembled on the highway,<BR>
Then the lively Lemminkainen<BR>
Raised himself upon the cross-bench,<BR>
Looked to see what else had happened;<BR>
Lo I a wolf stands at the portals,<BR>
in the passage-way a black-bear,<BR>
At the high-gate of Pohyola,<BR>
At the ending of the journey.</P>
<P>Thereupon young Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Thrusts his fingers in his pockets,<BR>
Seeks his magic pouch of leather,<BR>
Pulls therefrom a lock of ewe-wool,<BR>
Rubs it firmly in his fingers,<BR>
In his hands it falls to powder;<BR>
Breathes the breath of life upon it,<BR>
When a flock of sheep arises,<BR>
Goats and sheep of sable color;<BR>
On the flock the black-wolf pounces,<BR>
And the wild-bear aids the slaughter,<BR>
While the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
Rushes by them on his journey;<BR>
Gallops on a little distance,<BR>
To the court of Sariola,<BR>
Finds the fence of molten iron,<BR>
And of steel the rods and pickets,<BR>
In the earth a hundred fathoms,<BR>
To the azure sky, a thousand,<BR>
Double-pointed spears projecting;<BR>
On each spear were serpents twisted,<BR>
Adders coiled in countless numbers,<BR>
Lizards mingled with the serpents,<BR>
Tails entangled pointing earthward,<BR>
While their heads were skyward whirling,<BR>
Writhing, hissing mass of evil.</P>
<P>Then the stout-heart, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Deeply thought and long considered:<BR>
"It is as my mother told me,<BR>
This the wall that she predicted,<BR>
Stretching from the earth to heaven;<BR>
Downward deep are serpents creeping,<BR>
Deeper still the rails extending;<BR>
High as highest flight of eagles,<BR>
Higher still the wall shoots upward."</P>
<P>But the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Little cares, nor feels disheartened,<BR>
Draws his broadsword from its scabbard,<BR>
Draws his mighty blade ancestral,<BR>
Hews the wall with might of magic,<BR>
Breaks the palisade in pieces,<BR>
Hews to atoms seven pickets,<BR>
Chops the serpent-wall to fragments;<BR>
Through the breach he quickly passes<BR>
To the portals of Pohyola.</P>
<P>In the way, a serpent lying,<BR>
Lying crosswise in the entry,<BR>
Longer than the longest rafters,<BR>
Larger than the posts of oak-wood;<BR>
Hundred-eyed, the heinous serpent,<BR>
And a thousand tongues, the monster,<BR>
Eyes as large as sifting vessels,<BR>
Tongues as long as shafts of javelins,<BR>
Teeth as large as hatchet-handles,<BR>
Back as broad as skiffs of ocean.<BR>
Lemminkainen does not venture<BR>
Straightway through this host opposing,<BR>
Through the hundred heads of adders,<BR>
Through the thousand tongues of serpents.<BR>
Spake the magic Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Venomed viper, thing of evil,<BR>
Ancient adder of Tuoni,<BR>
Thou that crawlest in the stubble,<BR>
Through the flower-roots of Lempo,<BR>
Who has sent thee from thy kingdom,<BR>
Sent thee from thine evil coverts,<BR>
Sent thee hither, crawling, writhing,<BR>
In the pathway I would travel?<BR>
Who bestowed thy mouth of venom,<BR>
Who insisted, who commanded,<BR>
Thou shouldst raise thy head toward heaven,<BR>
Who thy tail has given action?<BR>
Was this given by the father,<BR>
Did the mother give this power,<BR>
Or the eldest of the brothers,<BR>
Or the youngest of the sisters,<BR>
Or some other of thy kindred?</P>
<P>"Close thy mouth, thou thing of evil,<BR>
Hide thy pliant tongue of venom,<BR>
In a circle wrap thy body,<BR>
Coil thou like a shield in silence,<BR>
Give to me one-half the pathway,<BR>
Let this wanderer pass by thee,<BR>
Or remove thyself entirely;<BR>
Get thee hence to yonder heather,<BR>
Quick retreat to bog and stubble,<BR>
Hide thyself in reeds and rushes,<BR>
In the brambles of the lowlands.<BR>
Like a ball of flax enfolding,<BR>
Like a sphere of aspen-branches,<BR>
With thy head and tail together,<BR>
Roll thyself to yonder mountain;<BR>
In the heather is thy dwelling,<BR>
Underneath the sod thy caverns.<BR>
Shouldst thou raise thy head in anger,<BR>
Mighty Ukko will destroy it,<BR>
Pierce it with his steel-tipped arrows,<BR>
With his death-balls made of iron!"</P>
<P>Hardly had the hero ended,<BR>
When the monster, little heeding,<BR>
Hissing with his tongue in anger,<BR>
Plying like the forked lightning,<BR>
Pounces with his mouth of venom<BR>
At the head of Lemminkainen;<BR>
But the hero, quick recalling,<BR>
Speaks the master-words of knowledge,<BR>
Words that came from distant ages,<BR>
Words his ancestors had taught him,<BR>
Words his mother learned in childhood,<BR>
These the words of Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Since thou wilt not heed mine order,<BR>
Since thou wilt not leave the highway,<BR>
Puffed with pride of thine own greatness,<BR>
Thou shall burst in triple pieces.<BR>
Leave thy station for the borders,<BR>
I will hunt thine ancient mother,<BR>
Sing thine origin of evil,<BR>
How arose thy head of horror;<BR>
Suoyatar, thine ancient mother,<BR>
Thing of evil, thy creator!"</P>
<P>"Suoyatar once let her spittle<BR>
Fall upon the waves of ocean;<BR>
This was rocked by winds and waters,<BR>
Shaken by the ocean-currents,<BR>
Six years rocked upon the billows,<BR>
Rocked in water seven summers,<BR>
On the blue-back of the ocean,<BR>
On the billows high as heaven;<BR>
Lengthwise did the billows draw it,<BR>
And the sunshine gave it softness,<BR>
To the shore the billows washed it,<BR>
On the coast the waters left it.</P>
<P>"Then appeared Creation's daughters,<BR>
Three the daughters thus appearing,<BR>
On the roaring shore of ocean,<BR>
There beheld the spittle lying,<BR>
And the daughters spake as follows:<BR>
'What would happen from this spittle,<BR>
Should the breath of the Creator<BR>
Fall upon the writhing matter,<BR>
Breathe the breath of life upon it,<BR>
Give the thing the sense of vision?</P>
<P>"The Creator heard these measures,<BR>
Spake himself the words that follow:<BR>
'Evil only comes from evil,<BR>
This is the expectoration<BR>
Of fell Suoyatar, its mother;<BR>
Therefore would the thing be evil,<BR>
Should I breathe a soul within it,<BR>
Should I give it sense of vision.'</P>
<P>"Hisi heard this conversation,<BR>
Ever ready with his mischief,<BR>
Made himself to be creator,<BR>
Breathed a soul into the spittle,<BR>
To fell Suoyatar's fierce anger.<BR>
Thus arose the poison-monster,<BR>
Thus was born the evil serpent,<BR>
This the origin of evil.</P>
<P>"Whence the life that gave her action'?<BR>
From the carbon-pile of Hisi.<BR>
Whence then was her heart created?<BR>
From the heart-throbs of her mother<BR>
Whence arose her brain of evil?<BR>
From the foam of rolling waters.<BR>
Whence was consciousness awakened?<BR>
From the waterfall's commotion.<BR>
Whence arose her head of venom?<BR>
From the seed-germs of the ivy.<BR>
Whence then came her eyes of fury?<BR>
From the flaxen seeds of Lempo.<BR>
Whence the evil ears for hearing?<BR>
From the foliage of Hisi.<BR>
Whence then was her mouth created?<BR>
This from Suoyatar's foam-currents<BR>
Whence arose thy tongue of anger r<BR>
From the spear of Keitolainen.<BR>
Whence arose thy fangs of poison?<BR>
From the teeth of Mana's daughter.<BR>
Whence then was thy back created?<BR>
From the carbon-posts of Piru.<BR>
How then was thy tail created?<BR>
From the brain of the hobgoblin.<BR>
Whence arose thy writhing entrails?<BR>
From the death-belt of Tuoni.</P>
<P>"This thine origin, O Serpent,<BR>
This thy charm of evil import,<BR>
Vilest thing of God's creation,<BR>
Writhing, hissing thing of evil,<BR>
With the color of Tuoni,<BR>
With the shade of earth and heaven,<BR>
With the darkness of the storm-cloud.<BR>
Get thee hence, thou loathsome monster,<BR>
Clear the pathway of this hero.<BR>
I am mighty Lemminkainen,<BR>
On my journey to Pohyola,<BR>
To the feastings and carousals,<BR>
In the halls of darksome Northland."</P>
<P>Thereupon the snake uncoiling,<BR>
Hundred-eyed and heinous monster,<BR>
Crawled away to other portals,<BR>
That the hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Might proceed upon his errand,<BR>
To the dismal Sariola,<BR>
To the feastings and carousals<BR>
In the banquet-halls of Pohya.</P>
