<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">KULLERVO'S EVIL DEEDS.</H1>
<P>KULLERWOINEN, youthful wizard,<BR>
In his blue and scarlet stockings,<BR>
Henceforth lingered with his parents;<BR>
But he could not change his nature,<BR>
Could not gain a higher wisdom,<BR>
Could not win a better judgment;<BR>
As a child he was ill-nurtured,<BR>
Early rocked in stupid cradles,<BR>
By a nurse of many follies,<BR>
By a minister of evil.</P>
<P>To his work went Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Strove to make his labors worthy;<BR>
First, Kullervo went a-fishing,<BR>
Set his fishing-nets in ocean;<BR>
With his hands upon the row-locks,<BR>
Kullerwoinen spake as follows:<BR>
"Shall I pull with all my forces,<BR>
Pull with strength of youthful heroes,<BR>
Or with weakness of the aged?"</P>
<P>From the stern arose a gray-beard,<BR>
And he answered thus Kullervo:<BR>
"Pull with all thy youthful vigor;<BR>
Shouldst thou row with magic power,<BR>
Thou couldst not destroy this vessel,<BR>
Couldst not row this boat to fragments."</P>
<P>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,<BR>
Rowed with all his youthful vigor,<BR>
With the mighty force of magic,<BR>
Rowed the bindings from the vessel,<BR>
Ribs of juniper he shattered,<BR>
Rowed the aspen-oars to pieces.</P>
<P>When the aged sire, Kalervo,<BR>
Saw the work of Kullerwoinen,<BR>
He addressed his son as follows:<BR>
"Dost not understand the rowing;<BR>
Thou hast burst the bands asunder,<BR>
Bands of juniper and willow,<BR>
Rowed my aspen-boat to pieces;<BR>
To the fish-nets drive the salmon,<BR>
This, perchance, will suit thee better."</P>
<P>Thereupon the son, Kullervo,<BR>
Hastened to his work as bidden,<BR>
Drove the salmon to the fish-nets,<BR>
Spake in innocence as follows:<BR>
"Shall I with my youthful vigor<BR>
Scare the salmon to the fish-nets,<BR>
Or with little magic vigor<BR>
Shall I drive them to their capture?<BR>
Spake the master of the fish-nets:<BR>
"That would be but work of women,<BR>
Shouldst thou use but little power<BR>
In the frighting of the salmon!"</P>
<P>Kullerwoinen does as bidden,<BR>
Scares the salmon with the forces<BR>
Of his mighty arms and shoulders,<BR>
With the strength of youth and magic,<BR>
Stirs the water thick with black-earth,<BR>
Beats the scare-net into pieces,<BR>
Into pulp he beats the salmon.</P>
<P>When the aged sire, Kalervo,<BR>
Saw the work of Kullerwoinen,<BR>
To his son these words he uttered:<BR>
"Dost not understand this labor,<BR>
For this work thou art not suited,<BR>
Canst not scare the perch and salmon<BR>
To the fish-nets of thy father;<BR>
Thou hast ruined all my fish-nets,<BR>
Torn my scare-net into tatters,<BR>
Beaten into pulp the whiting,<BR>
Torn my net-props into fragments,<BR>
Beaten into bits my wedges.<BR>
Leave the fishing to another;<BR>
See if thou canst pay the tribute,<BR>
Pay my yearly contribution;<BR>
See if thou canst better travel,<BR>
On the way show better judgment!"</P>
<P>Thereupon the son, Kullervo,<BR>
Hapless youth in purple vestments,<BR>
In his magic shoes of deer-skin,<BR>
In his locks of golden color,<BR>
Sallied forth to pay the taxes,<BR>
Pay the tribute for his people.<BR>
When the youth had paid the tribute,<BR>
Paid the yearly contribution,<BR>
He returned to join the snow-sledge,<BR>
Took his place upon the cross-bench,<BR>
Snapped his whip above the courser,<BR>
And began his journey homeward;<BR>
Rattled on along the highway,<BR>
Measured as he galloped onward<BR>
Wainamoinen's hills and valleys,<BR>
And his fields in cultivation.</P>
<P>Came a golden maid to meet him,<BR>
On her snow-shoes came a virgin,<BR>
O'er the hills of Wainamoinen,<BR>
O'er his cultivated lowlands.</P>
<P>Quick the wizard-son, Kullervo,<BR>
Checked the motion of his racer,<BR>
Thus addressed the charming maiden<BR>
"Come, sweet maiden, to my snow-sledge,<BR>
In my fur-robes rest and linger!"<BR>
As she ran, the maiden answered:<BR>
"Let the Death-maid sit beside thee,<BR>
Rest and linger in thy fur-robes!"</P>
<P>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,<BR>
Snapped his whip above the courser;<BR>
Fleet as wind he gallops homeward,<BR>
Dashes down along the highway;<BR>
With the roar of falling waters,<BR>
Gallops onward, onward, onward,<BR>
O'er the broad-back of the ocean,<BR>
O'er the icy plains of Lapland.</P>
<P>Comes a winsome maid to meet him,<BR>
Golden-haired, and wearing snow-shoes,<BR>
On the far outstretching ice-plains;<BR>
Quick the wizard checks his racer,<BR>
Charmingly accosts the maiden,<BR>
Chanting carefully these measures:<BR>
"Come, thou beauty, to my snow-sledge,<BR>
Hither come, and rest, and linger!<BR>
Tauntingly the maiden answered:<BR>
"Take Tuoni to thy snow-sledge,<BR>
At thy side let Manalainen<BR>
Sit with thee, and rest, and linger!"</P>
<P>Quick the wizard, Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Struck his fiery, prancing racer,<BR>
With the birch-whip of his father.<BR>
Like the lightning flew the fleet-foot,<BR>
Galloped on the highway homeward;<BR>
O'er the hills the snow-sledge bounded,<BR>
And the coming mountains trembled.<BR>
Kullerwoinen, wild magician,<BR>
Measures, on his journey homeward,<BR>
Northland's far-extending borders,<BR>
And the fertile plains of Pohya.<BR>
Comes a beauteous maid to meet him,<BR>
With a tin-pin on her bosom,<BR>
On the heather of Pohyola,<BR>
O'er the Pohya-hills and moorlands.</P>
<P>Quick the wizard son, Kullervo,<BR>
Holds the bridle of his courser,<BR>
Charmingly intones these measures:<BR>
"Come, fair maiden, to my snow-sledge,<BR>
In these fur-robes rest, and linger;<BR>
Eat with me the golden apples,<BR>
Eat the hazel-nut in joyance,<BR>
Drink with me the beer delicious,<BR>
Eat the dainties that I give thee."</P>
<P>This the answer of the maiden<BR>
With the tin-pin on her bosom:<BR>
"I have scorn to give thy snow-sledge,<BR>
Scorn for thee, thou wicked wizard;<BR>
Cold is it beneath thy fur-robes,<BR>
And thy sledge is chill and cheerless.</P>
<P>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,<BR>
Wicked wizard of the Northland,<BR>
Drew the maiden to his snow-sledge,<BR>
Drew her to a seat beside him,<BR>
Quickly in his furs enwrapped her;<BR>
And the tin-adorned made answer,<BR>
These the accents of the maiden:<BR>
"Loose me from thy magic power,<BR>
Let me leave at once thy presence,<BR>
Lest I speak in wicked accents,<BR>
Lest I say the prayer of evil;<BR>
Free me now as I command thee,<BR>
Or I'll tear thy sledge to pieces,<BR>
Throw these fur-robes to the north-winds."</P>
<P>Straightway wicked Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Evil wizard and magician,<BR>
Opens all his treasure-boxes,<BR>
Shows the maiden gold and silver,<BR>
Shows her silken wraps of beauty,<BR>
Silken hose with golden borders,<BR>
Golden belts with silver buckles,<BR>
Jewelry that dims the vision,<BR>
Blunts the conscience of the virgin.<BR>
Silver leads one to destruction,<BR>
Gold entices from uprightness.<BR>
Kullerwoinen, wicked wizard,<BR>
Flatters lovingly the maiden,<BR>
One hand on the reins of leather,<BR>
One upon the maiden's shoulder;<BR>
Thus they journey through the evening,<BR>
Pass the night in merry-making.</P>
<P>When the day-star led the morning,<BR>
When the second day was dawning,<BR>
Then the maid addressed Kullervo,<BR>
Questioned thus the wicked wizard:<BR>
"Of what tribe art thou descended,<BR>
Of what race thy hero-father?<BR>
Tell thy lineage and kindred.`<BR>
This, Kullervo's truthful answer:<BR>
"Am not from a mighty nation,<BR>
Not the greatest, nor the smallest,<BR>
But my lineage is worthy:<BR>
Am Kalervo's son of folly,<BR>
Am a child of contradictions,<BR>
Hapless son of cold misfortune.<BR>
Tell me of thy race of heroes,<BR>
Tell thine origin and kindred."<BR>
This the answer of the maiden:<BR>
"Came not from a race primeval,<BR>
Not the largest, nor the smallest,<BR>
But my lineage is worthy;<BR>
Am Kalervo's wretched daughter,<BR>
Am his long-lost child of error,<BR>
Am a maid of contradictions,<BR>
Hapless daughter of misfortune.</P>
<P>"When a child I lived in plenty<BR>
In the dwellings of my mother;<BR>
To the woods I went for berries,<BR>
Went for raspberries to uplands,<BR>
Gathered strawberries on mountains,<BR>
Gathered one day then a second;<BR>
But, alas! upon the third day,<BR>
Could not find the pathway homeward,<BR>
Forestward the highways led me,<BR>
All the footpaths, to the woodlands.<BR>
Long I sat in bitter weeping,<BR>
Wept one day and then a second,<BR>
Wept the third from morn till even.<BR>
Then I climbed a. lofty mountain,<BR>
There I called in wailing accents,<BR>
And the woodlands gave this answer,<BR>
Thus the distant hills re-echoed:<BR>
'Call no longer, foolish virgin,<BR>
All thy calls and tears are useless;<BR>
There is none to give thee answer,<BR>
Far away, thy home and people.'</P>
<P>"On the third and on the fourth days,<BR>
On the fifth, and sixth, and seventh,<BR>
Constantly I sought to perish;<BR>
But in vain were all my efforts,<BR>
Could not die upon the mountains.<BR>
If this wretched maid had perished,<BR>
In the summer of the third year,<BR>
She had fed earth's vegetation,<BR>
She had blossomed as a flower,<BR>
Knowing neither pain nor sorrow."</P>
<P>Scarcely had the maiden spoken,<BR>
When she bounded from the snow-sledge,<BR>
Rushed upon the rolling river,<BR>
To the cataract's commotion,<BR>
To the fiery stream and whirlpool.<BR>
Thus Kullervo's lovely sister<BR>
Hastened to her own destruction,<BR>
To her death by fire and water,<BR>
Found her peace in Tuonela,<BR>
In the sacred stream of Mana.</P>
<P>Then the wicked Kullerwoinen<BR>
Fell to weeping, sorely troubled,<BR>
Wailed, and wept, and heavy-hearted,<BR>
Spake these words in bitter sorrow:<BR>
"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<BR>
I have slain my virgin-sister,<BR>
Shamed the daughter of my mother;<BR>
Woe to thee, my ancient father!<BR>
Woe to thee, my gray-haired mother!<BR>
Wherefore was I born and nurtured,<BR>
Why this hapless child's existence?<BR>
Better fate to Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Had he never seen the daylight,<BR>
Or, if born, had never thriven<BR>
In these mournful days of evil!<BR>
Death has failed to do his duty,<BR>
Sickness sinned in passing by me,<BR>
Should have slain me in the cradle,<BR>
When the seventh day had ended!"</P>
<P>Thereupon he slips the collar<BR>
Of his prancing royal racer,<BR>
Mounts the silver-headed fleet-foot,<BR>
Gallops like the lightning homeward;<BR>
Gallops only for a moment,<BR>
When he halts his foaming courser<BR>
At the cabin of his father.<BR>
In the court-yard stood the mother,<BR>
Thus the wicked son addressed her:<BR>
"Faithful mother, fond and tender,<BR>
Hadst thou slain me when an infant,<BR>
Smoked my life out in the chamber,<BR>
In a winding-sheet hadst thrown me<BR>
To the cataract and whirlpool,<BR>
In the fire hadst set my cradle,<BR>
After seven nights had ended,<BR>
Worthy would have been thy service.<BR>
Had the village-maidens asked thee:<BR>
'Where is now the little cradle,<BR>
Wherefore is the bath-room empty?'<BR>
This had been a worthy answer:<BR>
'I have burned the wizard's cradle,<BR>
Cast the infant to the fire-dogs;<BR>
In the bath-room corn is sprouting,<BR>
From the barley malt is brewing.'"</P>
<P>Thereupon the aged mother<BR>
Asks her wizard-son these questions:<BR>
"What has happened to my hero,<BR>
What new fate has overcome thee?<BR>
Comest thou as from Tuoni,<BR>
From the castles of Manala?"<BR>
This, Kullervo's frank confession:<BR>
"Infamous the tale I bring thee,<BR>
My confession is dishonor:<BR>
On the way I met a maiden,<BR>
Met thy long-lost, wayward daughter,<BR>
Did not recognize my sister,<BR>
Fatal was the sin committed!<BR>
When the taxes had been settled,<BR>
When the tribute had been gathered,<BR>
Came a matchless maid to meet me,<BR>
Whom I witless led to sorrow,<BR>
This my mother's long-lost daughter.<BR>
When she saw in me her brother,<BR>
Quick she bounded from the snow-sledge,<BR>
Hastened to the roaring waters,<BR>
To the cataract's commotion,<BR>
To the fiery stream and whirlpool,<BR>
Hastened to her full destruction.</P>
<P>"Now, alas! must I determine,<BR>
Now must find a spot befitting,<BR>
Where thy sinful son may perish;<BR>
Tell me, all-forgiving mother,<BR>
Where to end my life of trouble;<BR>
Let me stop the black-wolf's howling,<BR>
Let me satisfy the hunger<BR>
Of the vicious bear of Northland;<BR>
Let the shark or hungry sea-dog<BR>
Be my dwelling-place hereafter!"<BR>
This the answer of the mother:<BR>
"Do not go to stop the howling<BR>
Of the hungry wolf of Northland;<BR>
Do not haste to still the black-bear<BR>
Growling in his forest-cavern;<BR>
Let not shark, nor vicious sea-dog<BR>
Be thy dwelling-place hereafter.<BR>
Spacious are the rooms of Suomi,<BR>
Limitless the Sawa-borders,<BR>
Large enough to hide transgression,<BR>
Man's misdeeds to hide for ages,<BR>
With his sins and evil actions.<BR>
Six long years man's sins lie hidden<BR>
In the border-land of Kalma,<BR>
Even nine for magic heroes,<BR>
Till the years bring consolation,<BR>
Till they quiet all his mourning."</P>
<P>Kullerwoinen, wicked wizard,<BR>
Answers thus his grieving mother:<BR>
"I can never hide from sorrow,<BR>
Cannot flee from my misconduct;<BR>
To the jaws of death I hasten,<BR>
To the open courts of Kalma,<BR>
To the hunting-grounds of Pohya,<BR>
To the battle-fields of heroes.<BR>
Untamoinen still is living,<BR>
Unmolested roams the wicked,<BR>
Unavenged my father's grievance,<BR>
Unavenged my mother's tortures,<BR>
Unavenged the wrongs I suffer!"</P>
