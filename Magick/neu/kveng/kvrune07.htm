<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WAINIOINEN'S RESCUE.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, old and truthful,<BR>
Swam through all the deep-sea waters,<BR>
Floating like a branch of aspen,<BR>
Like a withered twig of willow;<BR>
Swam six days in summer weather,<BR>
Swam six nights in golden moonlight;<BR>
Still before him rose the billows,<BR>
And behind him sky and ocean.<BR>
Two days more he swam undaunted,<BR>
Two long nights be struggled onward.<BR>
On the evening of the eighth day,<BR>
Wainamoinen grew disheartened,<BR>
Felt a very great discomfort,<BR>
For his feet had lost their toe-nails,<BR>
And his fingers dead and dying.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Sad and weary, spake as follows:<BR>
"Woe is me, my old life fated!<BR>
Woe is me, misfortune's offspring!<BR>
Fool was I when fortune, favored,<BR>
To forsake my home and kindred,<BR>
For a maiden fair and lovely,<BR>
Here beneath the starry heavens,<BR>
In this cruel waste of waters,<BR>
Days and nights to swim and wander,<BR>
Here to struggle with the storm-winds,<BR>
To be tossed by heaving billows,<BR>
In this broad sea's great expanses,<BR>
In this ocean vast and boundless.</P>
<P>"Cold my life and sad and dreary,<BR>
Painful too for me to linger<BR>
Evermore within these waters,<BR>
Thus to struggle for existence!<BR>
Cannot know how I can prosper,<BR>
How to find me food and shelter,<BR>
In these cold and lifeless waters,<BR>
In these days of dire misfortune.<BR>
Build I in the winds my dwelling?<BR>
It will find no sure foundation.<BR>
Build my home upon the billows?<BR>
Surely would the waves destroy it."</P>
<P>Comes a bird from far Pohyola,<BR>
From the occident, an eagle,<BR>
Is not classed among the largest,<BR>
Nor belongs he to the smallest;<BR>
One wing touches on the waters,<BR>
While the other sweeps the heavens;<BR>
O'er the waves he wings his body,<BR>
Strikes his beak upon the sea-cliffs,<BR>
Flies about, then safely perches,<BR>
Looks before him, looks behind him,<BR>
There beholds brave Wainamoinen,<BR>
On the blue-back of the ocean,<BR>
And the eagle thus accosts him:<BR>
"Wherefore art thou, ancient hero,<BR>
Swimming in the deep-sea billows?<BR>
Thus the water-minstrel answered:<BR>
"I am ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Friend and fellow of the waters<BR>
I, the famous wisdom-singer;<BR>
Went to woo a Northland maiden,<BR>
Maiden from the dismal Darkland,<BR>
Quickly galloped on my journey,<BR>
Riding on the plain of ocean.<BR>
I arrived one morning early,<BR>
At the breaking of the day-dawn.<BR>
At the bay of Luotola,<BR>
Near Youkola's foaming river,<BR>
Where the evil Youkahainen<BR>
Slew my steed with bow and arrow,<BR>
Tried to slay me with his weapons.<BR>
On the waters fell I headlong,<BR>
Plunged beneath the salt-sea's surface,<BR>
From the saddle of the courser,<BR>
From my dappled steed of magic.</P>
<P>"Then arose a mighty storm-wind,<BR>
From the East and West a whirlwind,<BR>
Washed me seaward on the surges,<BR>
Seaward, seaward, further, further,<BR>
Where for many days I wandered,<BR>
Swam and rocked upon the billows,<BR>
Where as many nights I struggled,<BR>
In the dashing waves and sea-foam,<BR>
With the angry winds and waters.</P>
<P>"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<BR>
Cannot solve this heavy problem,<BR>
How to live nor how to perish<BR>
In this cruel salt-sea water.<BR>
Build I in the winds my dwelling?<BR>
It will find no sure foundation.<BR>
Build my home upon the waters?<BR>
Surely will the waves destroy it.<BR>
Must I swim the sea forever,<BR>
Must I live, or must I perish?<BR>
What will happen if I perish,<BR>
If I sink below the billows,<BR>
Perish here from cold and hunger?"<BR>
Thus the bird of Ether answered<BR>
"Be not in the least disheartened,<BR>
Place thyself between my shoulders,<BR>
On my back be firmly seated,<BR>
I will lift thee from the waters,<BR>
Bear thee with my pinions upward,<BR>
Bear thee wheresoe'er thou willest.<BR>
Well do I the day remember<BR>
Where thou didst the eagle service,<BR>
When thou didst the birds a favor.<BR>
Thou didst leave the birch-tree standing,<BR>
When were cleared the Osmo-forests,<BR>
From the lands of Kalevala,<BR>
As a home for weary song-birds,<BR>
As a resting-place for eagles."</P>
<P>Then arises Wainamoinen,<BR>
Lifts his head above the waters,<BR>
Boldly rises from the sea-waves,<BR>
Lifts his body from the billows,<BR>
Seats himself upon the eagle,<BR>
On the eagle's feathered shoulders.<BR>
Quick aloft the huge bird bears him,<BR>
Bears the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Bears him on the path of zephyrs,<BR>
Floating on the vernal breezes,<BR>
To the distant shore of Northland,<BR>
To the dismal Sariola,<BR>
Where the eagle leaves his burden,<BR>
Flies away to join his fellows.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, lone and weary,<BR>
Straightway fell to bitter weeping,<BR>
Wept and moaned in heavy accents,<BR>
On the border of the blue-sea.<BR>
On a cheerless promontory,<BR>
With a hundred wounds tormented,<BR>
Made by cruel winds and waters,<BR>
With his hair and beard dishevelled<BR>
By the surging of the billows.<BR>
Three long days he wept disheartened<BR>
Wept as many nights in anguish,<BR>
Did not know what way to journey,<BR>
Could not find a woodland foot-print,<BR>
That would point him to the highway,<BR>
To his home in Kalevala,<BR>
To his much-loved home and kindred.</P>
<P>Northland's young and slender maiden,<BR>
With complexion fair and lovely,<BR>
With the Sun had laid a wager,<BR>
With the Sun and Moon a wager,<BR>
Which should rise before the other,<BR>
On the morning of the morrow.<BR>
And the maiden rose in beauty,<BR>
Long before the Sun had risen,<BR>
Long before the Moon bad wakened,<BR>
From their beds beneath the ocean.<BR>
Ere the cock had crowed the day-break,<BR>
Ere the Sun had broken slumber<BR>
She had sheared six gentle lambkins,<BR>
Gathered from them six white fleeces,<BR>
Hence to make the rolls for spinning,<BR>
Hence to form the threads for weaving,<BR>
Hence to make the softest raiment,<BR>
Ere the morning dawn had broken,<BR>
Ere the sleeping Sun had risen.</P>
<P>When this task the maid had ended,<BR>
Then she scrubbed the birchen tables,<BR>
Sweeps the ground-floor of the stable,<BR>
With a broom of leaves and branches<BR>
From the birches of the Northland,<BR>
Scrapes the sweepings well together<BR>
On a shovel made of copper,<BR>
Carries them beyond the stable,<BR>
From the doorway to the meadow,<BR>
To the meadow's distant border,<BR>
Near the surges of the great-sea,<BR>
Listens there and looks about her,<BR>
Hears a wailing from the waters,<BR>
Hears a weeping from the sea-shore,<BR>
Hears a hero-voice lamenting.</P>
<P>Thereupon she hastens homeward,<BR>
Hastens to her mother's dwelling,<BR>
These the words the maiden utters:<BR>
"I have heard a wail from ocean,<BR>
Heard a weeping from the sea-coast,<BR>
On the shore some one lamenting."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Ancient, toothless dame of Northland,<BR>
Hastens from her door and court-yard,<BR>
Through the meadow to the sea-shore,<BR>
Listens well for sounds of weeping,<BR>
For the wail of one in sorrow;<BR>
Hears the voice of one in trouble,<BR>
Hears a hero-cry of anguish.<BR>
Thus the ancient Louhi answers:<BR>
"This is not the wail of children,<BR>
These are not the tears of women,<BR>
In this way weep bearded heroes;<BR>
This the hero-cry of anguish."</P>
<P>Quick she pushed her boat to water,<BR>
To the floods her goodly vessel,<BR>
Straightway rows with lightning swiftness,<BR>
To the weeping Wainamoinen;<BR>
Gives the hero consolation,<BR>
Comfort gives she to the minstrel<BR>
Wailing in a grove of willows,<BR>
In his piteous condition,<BR>
Mid the alder-trees and aspens,<BR>
On the border of the salt-sea,<BR>
Visage trembling, locks dishevelled.<BR>
Ears, and eyes, and lips of sadness.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Thus addresses Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Tell me what has been thy folly,<BR>
That thou art in this condition."</P>
<P>Old and truthful Wainamoinen<BR>
Lifts aloft his bead and answers:<BR>
"Well I know that it is folly<BR>
That has brought me all this trouble,<BR>
Brought me to this land of strangers,<BR>
To these regions unbefitting<BR>
Happy was I with my kindred,<BR>
In my distant home and country,<BR>
There my name was named in honor."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Thus replied to Wainamoinen:<BR>
"I would gain the information,<BR>
Should I be allowed to ask thee,<BR>
Who thou art of ancient heroes,<BR>
Who of all the host of heroes?<BR>
This is Wainamoinen's answer:<BR>
"Formerly my name was mentioned,<BR>
Often was I heard and honored,<BR>
As a minstrel and magician,<BR>
In the long and dreary winters,<BR>
Called the 'Singer of the Northland,<BR>
In the valleys of Wainola,<BR>
On the plains of Kalevala;<BR>
No one thought that such misfortune<BR>
Could befall wise Wainamoinen."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Thus replied in cheering accents<BR>
"Rise, O hero, from discomfort,<BR>
From thy bed among the willows;<BR>
Enter now upon the new-way,<BR>
Come with me to yonder dwelling,<BR>
There relate thy strange adventures,<BR>
Tell the tale of thy misfortunes."</P>
<P>Now she takes the hapless hero,<BR>
Lifts him from his bed of sorrow,<BR>
In her boat she safely seats him,<BR>
And begins at once her rowing,<BR>
Rows with steady hand and mighty<BR>
To her home upon the sea-shore,<BR>
To the dwellings of Pohyola.<BR>
There she feeds the starving hero,<BR>
Rests the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Gives him warmth, and food, and shelter,<BR>
And the hero soon recovers.</P>
<P>Then the hostess of Pohyola<BR>
Questioned thus the ancient singer:<BR>
"Wherefore didst thou, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Friend and fellow of the waters,<BR>
Weep in sad and bitter accents,<BR>
On the border of the ocean,<BR>
Mid the aspens and the willows?"</P>
<P>This is Wainamoinen's answer:<BR>
Had good reason for my weeping,<BR>
Cause enough for all my sorrow;<BR>
Long indeed had I been swimming,<BR>
Had been buffeting the billows,<BR>
In the far outstretching waters.<BR>
This the reason for my weeping;<BR>
I have lived in toil and torture,<BR>
Since I left my home and country,<BR>
Left my native land and kindred,<BR>
Came to this the land of strangers,<BR>
To these unfamiliar portals.<BR>
All thy trees have thorns to wound me,<BR>
All thy branches, spines to pierce me,<BR>
Even birches give me trouble,<BR>
And the alders bring discomfort,<BR>
My companions, winds and waters,<BR>
Only does the Sun seem friendly,<BR>
In this cold and cruel country,<BR>
Near these unfamiliar portals."</P>
<P>Louhi thereupon made answer,<BR>
Weep no longer, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Grieve no more, thou friend of waters,<BR>
Good for thee, that thou shouldst linger<BR>
At our friendly homes and firesides;<BR>
Thou shalt live with us and welcome,<BR>
Thou shalt sit at all our tables,<BR>
Eat the salmon from our platters,<BR>
Eat the sweetest of our bacon,<BR>
Eat the whiting from our waters."</P>
<P>Answers thus old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Grateful for the invitation:<BR>
"Never do I court strange tables,<BR>
Though the food be rare and toothsome;<BR>
One's own country is the dearest,<BR>
One's own table is the sweetest,<BR>
One's own home, the most attractive.<BR>
Grant, kind Ukko, God above me,<BR>
Thou Creator, full of mercy,<BR>
Grant that I again may visit<BR>
My beloved home and country.<BR>
Better dwell in one's own country,<BR>
There to drink Its healthful waters<BR>
From the simple cups of birch-wood,<BR>
Than in foreign lands to wander,<BR>
There to drink the rarest liquors<BR>
From the golden bowls of strangers."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Thus replied to the magician:<BR>
"What reward wilt thou award me,<BR>
Should I take thee where thou willest,<BR>
To thy native land and kindred,<BR>
To thy much-loved home and fireside,<BR>
To the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
To the plains of Kalevala?"</P>
<P>These the words of Wainamoinen:<BR>
"What would be reward sufficient,<BR>
Shouldst thou take me to my people,<BR>
To my home and distant country,<BR>
To the borders of the Northland,<BR>
There to hear the cuckoo singing,<BR>
Hear the sacred cuckoo calling?<BR>
Shall I give thee golden treasures,<BR>
Fill thy cups with finest silver?"</P>
<P>This is Louhi's simple answer:<BR>
"O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Only true and wise magician,<BR>
Never will I ask for riches,<BR>
Never ask for gold nor silver;<BR>
Gold is for the children's flowers,<BR>
Silver for the stallion's jewels.<BR>
Canst thou forge for me the Sampo,<BR>
Hammer me the lid in colors,<BR>
From the tips of white-swan feathers<BR>
From the milk of greatest virtue,<BR>
From a single grain of barley,<BR>
From the finest wool of lambkins?</P>
<P>"I will give thee too my daughter,<BR>
Will reward thee through the maiden,<BR>
Take thee to thy much-loved home-land,<BR>
To the borders of Wainola,<BR>
There to hear the cuckoo singing,<BR>
Hear the sacred cuckoo calling."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, much regretting,<BR>
Gave this answer to her question:<BR>
"Cannot forge for thee the Sampo,<BR>
Cannot make the lid in colors.<BR>
Take me to my distant country,<BR>
I will send thee Ilmarinen,<BR>
He will forge for thee the Sampo,<BR>
Hammer thee the lid in colors,<BR>
He may win thy lovely maiden;<BR>
Worthy smith is Ilmarinen,<BR>
In this art is first and master;<BR>
He, the one that forged the heavens.<BR>
Forged the air a hollow cover;<BR>
Nowhere see we hammer-traces,<BR>
Nowhere find a single tongs-mark."</P>
<P>Thus replied the hostess, Louhi:<BR>
"Him alone I'll give my daughter,<BR>
Promise him my child in marriage,<BR>
Who for me will forge the Sampo,<BR>
Hammer me the lid in colors,<BR>
From the tips of white-swan feathers,<BR>
From the milk of greatest virtue,<BR>
From a single grain of barley,<BR>
From the finest wool of lambkins."</P>
<P>Thereupon the hostess Louhi,<BR>
Harnessed quick a dappled courser,<BR>
Hitched him to her sledge of birch-wood,<BR>
Placed within it Wainamoinen,<BR>
Placed the hero on the cross-bench,<BR>
Made him ready for his journey;<BR>
Then addressed the ancient minstrel,<BR>
These the words that Louhi uttered:<BR>
"Do not raise thine eyes to heaven,<BR>
Look not upward on thy journey,<BR>
While thy steed is fresh and frisky,<BR>
While the day-star lights thy pathway,<BR>
Ere the evening star has risen;<BR>
If thine eyes be lifted upward,<BR>
While the day-star lights thy pathway,<BR>
Dire misfortune will befall thee,<BR>
Some sad fate will overtake thee."</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Fleetly drove upon his journey,<BR>
Merrily he hastened homeward,<BR>
Hastened homeward, happy-hearted<BR>
From the ever-darksome Northland<BR>
From the dismal Sariola.</P>
