<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE BRIDE'S FAREWELL.</H1>
<P>WHEN the marriage was completed,<BR>
When the many guests had feasted,<BR>
At the wedding of the Northland,<BR>
At the Dismal-land carousal,<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola<BR>
To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Wherefore, bridegroom, dost thou linger,<BR>
Why art waiting, Northland hero?<BR>
Sittest for the father's pleasure,<BR>
For affection of the mother,<BR>
For the splendor of the maidens,<BR>
For the beauty of the daughter?<BR>
Noble son-in-law and brother,<BR>
Wait thou longer, having waited<BR>
Long already for the virgin,<BR>
Thine affianced is not ready,<BR>
Not prepared, thy life-companion,<BR>
Only are her tresses braided.</P>
<P>"Chosen bridegroom, pride of Pohya,<BR>
Wait thou longer, having waited<BR>
Long already for the virgin,<BR>
Thy beloved is preparing,<BR>
Only is one hand made ready.</P>
<P>"Famous artist, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Wait still longer, having waited<BR>
Long already for the virgin,<BR>
Thy beloved is not ready,<BR>
Only is one foot in fur-shoes,"<BR>
Spake again the ancient Louhi:<BR>
"Chosen suitor of my daughter,<BR>
Thou hast thrice in kindness waited,<BR>
Wait no longer for the virgin,<BR>
Thy beloved now is ready,<BR>
Well prepared thy life-companion,<BR>
Fairy Maiden of the Rainbow.</P>
<P>"Beauteous daughter, join thy suitor,<BR>
Follow him, thy chosen husband,<BR>
Very near is the uniting,<BR>
Near indeed thy separation.<BR>
At thy hand the honored bridegroom,<BR>
Near the door he waits to lead thee,<BR>
Guide thee to his home and kindred;<BR>
At the gate his steed is waiting,<BR>
Restless champs his silver bridle,<BR>
And the sledge awaits thy presence.</P>
<P>"Thou wert anxious for a suitor,<BR>
Ready to accept his offer,<BR>
Wert in haste to take his jewels,<BR>
Place his rings upon thy fingers;<BR>
Now, fair daughter, keep thy promise;<BR>
To his sledge, with happy footsteps,<BR>
Hie in haste to join the bridegroom,<BR>
Gaily journey to the village<BR>
With thy chosen life-companion,<BR>
With thy suitor, Ilmarinen.<BR>
Little hast thou looked about thee,<BR>
Hast not raised thine eyes above thee,<BR>
Beauteous maiden of the Northland,<BR>
Hast thou made a rueful bargain,<BR>
Full of wailing thine engagement,<BR>
And thy marriage full of sorrow,<BR>
That thy father's ancient cottage<BR>
Thou art leaving now forever,<BR>
Leaving also friends and kindred,<BR>
For the, blacksmith, Ilmarinen?</P>
<P>"O how beautiful thy childhood,<BR>
In thy father's dwelling-places,<BR>
Nurtured like a tender flower,<BR>
Like the strawberry in spring-time<BR>
Soft thy couch and sweet thy slumber,<BR>
Warm thy fires and rich thy table;<BR>
From the fields came corn in plenty,<BR>
From the highlands, milk and berries,<BR>
Wheat and barley in abundance,<BR>
Fish, and fowl, and hare, and bacon,<BR>
From thy father's fields and forests.</P>
<P>"Never wert thou, child, in sorrow,<BR>
Never hadst thou grief nor trouble,<BR>
All thy cares were left to fir-trees,<BR>
All thy worry to the copses,<BR>
All thy weeping to the willows,<BR>
All thy sighing to the lindens,<BR>
All thy thinking to the aspens<BR>
And the birches on the mountains,<BR>
Light and airy as the leaflet,<BR>
As a butterfly in summer,<BR>
Ruddy as a mountain-berry,<BR>
Beautiful as vernal flowers.</P>
<P>"Now thou leavest home and kindred,<BR>
Wanderest to other firesides,<BR>
Goest to another mother,<BR>
Other sisters, other brothers,<BR>
Goest to a second father,<BR>
To the servant-folk of strangers,<BR>
From thy native hills and lowlands.<BR>
There and here the homes will differ,<BR>
Happier thy mother's hearth-stone;<BR>
Other horns will there be sounded,<BR>
Other portals there swing open,<BR>
Other hinges there be creaking;<BR>
There the doors thou canst not enter<BR>
Like the daughters of Wainola,<BR>
Canst not tend the fires and ovens<BR>
As will please the minds of strangers.</P>
<P>"Didst thou think, my fairest maiden,<BR>
Thou couldst wed and on the morrow<BR>
Couldst return, if thou shouldst wish it,<BR>
To thy father's court and dwelling?<BR>
Not for one, nor two, nor three days,<BR>
Wilt thou leave thy mother's chambers,<BR>
Leave thy sisters and thy brothers,<BR>
Leave thy father's hills and lowlands.<BR>
Long the time the wife must wander,<BR>
Many months and years must wander,<BR>
Work, and struggle, all her life long,<BR>
Even though the mother liveth.<BR>
Great, indeed, must be the changes<BR>
When thou comest back to Pohya,<BR>
Changed, thy friends and nearest kindred,<BR>
Changed, thy father's ancient dwellings,<BR>
Changed, the valleys and the mountains,<BR>
Other birds will sing thy praises!"</P>
<P>When the mother thus had spoken,<BR>
Then the daughter spake, departing:<BR>
"In my early days of childhood<BR>
Often I intoned these measures:<BR>
'Art a virgin, yet no virgin,<BR>
Guided by an aged mother,<BR>
In a brother's fields and forests,<BR>
In the mansion of a father!<BR>
Only wilt become a virgin,<BR>
Only when thou hast a suitor,<BR>
Only when thou wedst a hero,<BR>
One foot on the father's threshold,<BR>
And the other for the snow-sledge<BR>
That will speed thee and thy husband<BR>
To his native vales and highlands!'</P>
<P>"I have wished thus many summers,<BR>
Sang it often in my childhood,<BR>
Hoped for this as for the flowers,<BR>
Welcome as the birds of spring-time.<BR>
Thus fulfilled are all my wishes,<BR>
Very near is my departure,<BR>
One foot on my father's threshold,<BR>
And the, other for the journey<BR>
With my husband to his people;<BR>
Cannot understand the reason<BR>
That has changed my former feelings,<BR>
Cannot leave thee now with gladness,<BR>
Cannot go with great rejoicing<BR>
From my dear, old home and kindred,<BR>
Where as maiden I have lingered,<BR>
From the courts where I was nurtured,<BR>
From my father's band and guidance,<BR>
From my faithful mother's counsel.<BR>
Now I go, a maid of sorrow,<BR>
Heavy-hearted to the bridegroom,<BR>
Like the bride of Night in winter,<BR>
Like the ice upon the rivers.</P>
<P>"Such is not the mind of others,<BR>
Other brides of Northland heroes;<BR>
Others do not leave unhappy,<BR>
Have no tears, nor cares, nor sorrows,<BR>
I alas! must weep and murmur,<BR>
Carry to my grave great sadness,<BR>
Heart as dark as Death's black river.</P>
<P>"Such the feelings of the happy,<BR>
Such the minds of merry maidens:<BR>
Like the early dawn of spring-time,<BR>
Like the rising Sun in summer<BR>
No such radiance awaits me,<BR>
With my young heart filled with terror;<BR>
Happiness is not my portion,<BR>
Like the flat-shore of the ocean,<BR>
Like the dark rift of the storm-cloud,<BR>
Like the cheerless nights of winter!<BR>
Dreary is the day in autumn,<BR>
Dreary too the autumn evening,<BR>
Still more dreary is my future!"</P>
<P>An industrious old maiden,<BR>
Ever guarding home and kindred,<BR>
Spake these words of doubtful comfort:<BR>
"Dost thou, beauteous bride, remember,<BR>
Canst thou not recall my counsels?<BR>
These the words that I have taught thee:<BR>
'Look not joyfully for suitors,<BR>
Never heed the tongues of wooers,<BR>
Look not in the eyes of charmers,<BR>
At their feet let fall thy vision.<BR>
He that hath a mouth for sweetness,<BR>
He that hath an eye for beauty,<BR>
Offers little that will comfort;<BR>
Lempo sits upon his forehead,<BR>
In his mouth dwells dire Tuoni.'</P>
<P>"Thus, fair bride, did I advise thee,<BR>
Thus advised my sister's daughter:<BR>
Should there come the best of suitors,<BR>
Noblest wooers, proudest lovers,<BR>
Give to all these wisdom-sayings,<BR>
Let thine answer be as follows:<BR>
'Never will I think it wisdom,<BR>
Never will it be my pleasure,<BR>
To become a second daughter,<BR>
Linger with my husband's mother;<BR>
Never shall I leave my father,<BR>
Never wander forth to bondage,<BR>
At the bidding of a bridegroom:<BR>
Never shall I be a servant,<BR>
Wife and slave to any hero,<BR>
Never will I be submissive<BR>
To the orders of a husband.'</P>
<P>"Fairest bride, thou didst not heed me,<BR>
Gav'st no thought to my advices,<BR>
Didst not listen to my counsel;<BR>
Wittingly thy feet have wandered<BR>
Into boiling tar and water,<BR>
Hastened to thy suitor's snow-sledge,<BR>
To the bear-dens of thy husband,<BR>
On his sledge to be ill-treated,<BR>
Carried to his native country,<BR>
To the bondage of his people,<BR>
There, a subject to his mother.<BR>
Thou hast left thy mother's dwelling,<BR>
To the schooling of the master;<BR>
Hard indeed the master's teachings,<BR>
Little else than constant torture;<BR>
Ready for thee are his bridles,<BR>
Ready for thy bands the shackles,<BR>
Were not forged for any other;<BR>
Soon, indeed, thou'lt feel the hardness,<BR>
Feel the weight of thy misfortune,<BR>
Feel thy second father's censure,<BR>
And his wife's inhuman treatment,<BR>
Hear the cold words or thy brother,<BR>
Quail before thy haughty sister.</P>
<P>"Listen, bride, to what I tell thee:<BR>
In thy home thou wert a jewel,<BR>
Wert thy father's pride and pleasure,<BR>
'Moonlight,' did thy father call thee,<BR>
And thy mother called thee 'Sunshine,'<BR>
'Sea-foam' did thy brother call thee,<BR>
And thy sister called thee 'Flower.'<BR>
When thou leavest home and kindred<BR>
Goest to a second mother,<BR>
Often she will give thee censure,<BR>
Never treat thee as her daughter,<BR>
Rarely will she give thee counsel,<BR>
Never will she sound thy praises.<BR>
'Brush-wood,' will the father call thee,<BR>
'Sledge of Rags,' thy husband's mother,<BR>
'Flight of Stairs,' thy stranger brother,<BR>
'Scare-crow,' will the sister call thee,<BR>
Sister of thy blacksmith-husband;<BR>
Then wilt think of my good counsels,<BR>
Then wilt wish in tears and murmurs,<BR>
That as steam thou hadst ascended,<BR>
That as smoke thy soul had risen,<BR>
That as sparks thy life had vanished.<BR>
As a bird thou canst not wander<BR>
From thy nest to circle homeward,<BR>
Canst not fall and die like leaflets,<BR>
As the sparks thou canst not perish,<BR>
Like the smoke thou canst not vanish.</P>
<P>"Youthful bride, and darling sister,<BR>
Thou hast bartered all thy friendships,<BR>
Hast exchanged thy loving father,<BR>
Thou hast left thy faithful mother<BR>
For the mother of thy husband;<BR>
Hast exchanged thy loving brother,<BR>
Hast renounced thy gentle sister,<BR>
For the kindred of thy suitor;<BR>
Hast exchanged thy snow-white covers<BR>
For the rocky couch of sorrow;<BR>
Hast exchanged these crystal waters<BR>
For the waters of Wainola;<BR>
Hast renounced these sandy sea-shores<BR>
For the muddy banks of Kalew;<BR>
Northland glens thou hast forsaken<BR>
For thy husband's barren meadows;<BR>
Thou hast left thy berry-mountains<BR>
For the stubble-fields and deserts.</P>
<P>"Thou, O maiden, hast been thinking<BR>
Thou wouldst happy be in wedlock;<BR>
Neither work, nor care, nor sorrow,<BR>
From this night would be thy portion,<BR>
With thy husband for protection.<BR>
Not to sleep art thou conducted,<BR>
Not to happiness, nor joyance,<BR>
Wakefulness, thy night-companion,<BR>
And thy day-attendant, trouble;<BR>
Often thou wilt drink of sorrow,<BR>
Often long for vanished pleasures.</P>
<P>"When at home thou hadst no head-gear,<BR>
Thou hadst also little sadness;<BR>
When thy couch was not of linen,<BR>
No unhappiness came nigh thee;<BR>
Head-gear brings but pain and sorrow,<BR>
Linen breeds bad dispositions,<BR>
Linen brings but deeps of anguish,<BR>
And the flax untimely mourning.</P>
<P>"Happy in her home, the maiden,<BR>
Happy at her father's fireside,<BR>
Like the master in his mansion,<BR>
Happy with her bows and arrows.<BR>
'Tis not thus with married women;<BR>
Brides of heroes may be likened<BR>
To the prisoners of Moskva,<BR>
Held in bondage by their masters.</P>
<P>"As a wife, must weep and labor,<BR>
Carry trouble on both shoulders;<BR>
When the next hour passes over,<BR>
Thou must tend the fire and oven,<BR>
Must prepare thy husband's dinner,<BR>
Must direct thy master's servants.<BR>
When thine evening meal is ready,<BR>
Thou must search for bidden wisdom<BR>
In the brain of perch and salmon,<BR>
In the mouths of ocean whiting,<BR>
Gather wisdom from the cuckoo,<BR>
Canst not learn it from thy mother,<BR>
Mother dear of seven daughters;<BR>
Cannot find among her treasures<BR>
Where were born the human instincts,<BR>
Where were born the minds of heroes,<BR>
Whence arose the maiden's beauty,<BR>
Whence the beauty of her tresses,<BR>
Why all life revives in spring-time.</P>
<P>"Weep, O weep, my pretty young bride.<BR>
When thou weepest, weep sincerely,<BR>
Weep great rivers from thine eyelids,<BR>
Floods of tears in field and fallow,<BR>
Lakelets in thy father's dwelling;<BR>
Weep thy rooms to overflowing,<BR>
Shed thy tears in great abundance,<BR>
Lest thou weepest on returning<BR>
To thy native hills and valleys,<BR>
When thou visitest thy father<BR>
In the smoke of waning glory,<BR>
On his arm a withered tassel.</P>
<P>"Weep, O weep, my lovely maiden,<BR>
When thou weepest, weep in earnest,<BR>
Weep great rivers from thine eyelids;<BR>
If thou dost not weep sincerely,<BR>
Thou wilt weep on thy returning<BR>
To thy Northland home and kindred,<BR>
When thou visitest thy mother<BR>
Old and breathless near the hurdles,<BR>
In her arms a barley-bundle.</P>
<P>"Weep, O weep, sweet bride of beauty,<BR>
When thou weepest, weep profusely;<BR>
If thou dost not weep in earnest,<BR>
Thou wilt weep on thy returning<BR>
To thy native vales and highlands,<BR>
When thou visitest thy brother<BR>
Lying wounded by the way-side,<BR>
In his hand but empty honors.</P>
<P>"Weep, O weep, my sister's daughter,<BR>
Weep great rivers from thine eyelids;<BR>
If thou dost not weep sufficient,<BR>
Thou wilt weep on thy returning<BR>
To the scenes of happy childhood,<BR>
When thou visitest thy sister<BR>
Lying, prostrate in the meadow,<BR>
In her hand a birch-wood mallet."</P>
<P>When the ancient maid had ended,<BR>
Then the young bride sighed in anguish,<BR>
Straightway fell to bitter weeping,<BR>
Spake these words in deeps of sorrow:<BR>
"O, ye sisters, my beloved,<BR>
Ye companions of my childhood,<BR>
Playmates of my early summers,<BR>
Listen to your sister's counsel:<BR>
Cannot comprehend the reason,<BR>
Why my mind is so dejected,<BR>
Why this weariness and sadness,<BR>
This untold and unseen torture,<BR>
Cannot understand the meaning<BR>
Of this mighty weight of sorrow!<BR>
Differently I had thought it,<BR>
I had hoped for greater pleasures,<BR>
I had hoped to sing as cuckoos,<BR>
On the hill-tops call and echo,<BR>
When I had attained this station,<BR>
Reached at last the goal expectant;<BR>
But I am not like the cuckoo,<BR>
Singing, merry on the hill-tops;<BR>
I am like the songless blue-duck,<BR>
As she swims upon the waters,<BR>
Swims upon the cold, cold ocean,<BR>
Icicles upon her pinions.</P>
<P>"Ancient father, gray-haired mother,<BR>
Whither do ye wish to lead me,<BR>
Whither take this bride, thy daughter,<BR>
That this sorrow may pass over,<BR>
Where this heavy heart may lighten,<BR>
Where this grief may turn to gladness?<BR>
Better it had been, O mother,<BR>
Hadst thou nursed a block of birch-wood,<BR>
Hadst thou clothed the colored sandstone,<BR>
Rather than this hapless maiden,<BR>
For the fulness of these sorrows,<BR>
For this keen and killing trouble.</P>
<P>Many sympathizers tell me:<BR>
'Foolish bride, thou art ungrateful,<BR>
Do not grieve, thou child of sorrow,<BR>
Thou hast little cause for weeping.'</P>
<P>"O, deceive me not, my people,<BR>
Do not argue with me falsely,<BR>
For alas! I have more troubles<BR>
Than the waterfalls have pebbles,<BR>
Than the Ingerland has willows,<BR>
Than the Suomi-hills have berries;<BR>
Never could the Pohya plow-horse<BR>
Pull this mighty weight of sorrow,<BR>
Shaking not his birchen cross-bar,<BR>
Breaking not his heavy collar;<BR>
Never could the Northland reindeer<BR>
Heavy shod and stoutly harnessed,<BR>
Draw this load of care and trouble."</P>
<P>By the stove a babe was playing,<BR>
And the young child spake as follows:<BR>
"Why, O fair bride, art thou weeping,<BR>
Why these tears of pain and sadness?<BR>
Leave thy troubles to the elk-herds,<BR>
And thy grief to sable fillies,<BR>
Let the steeds of iron bridles<BR>
Bear the burden of thine anguish,<BR>
Horses have much larger foreheads,<BR>
Larger shoulders, stronger sinews,<BR>
And their necks are made for labor,<BR>
Stronger are their bones and muscles,<BR>
Let them bear thy heavy burdens.<BR>
There is little good in weeping,<BR>
Useless are thy tears of sorrow;<BR>
Art not led to swamps and lowlands,<BR>
Nor to banks of little rivers;<BR>
Thou art led to fields of flowers,<BR>
Led to fruitful trees and forests,<BR>
Led away from beer of Pohya<BR>
To the sweeter mead of Kalew.<BR>
At thy shoulder waits thy husband,<BR>
On thy right side, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Constant friend and life-protector,<BR>
He will guard thee from all evil;<BR>
Husband ready, steed in waiting,<BR>
Gold-and-silver-mounted harness,<BR>
Hazel-birds that sing and flutter<BR>
On the courser's yoke and cross-bar;<BR>
Thrushes also sing and twitter<BR>
Merrily on hame and collar,<BR>
Seven bluebirds, seven cuckoos,<BR>
Sing thy wedding-march in concord.</P>
<P>"Be no longer full of sorrow,<BR>
Dry thy tears, thou bride of beauty,<BR>
Thou hast found a noble husband,<BR>
Better wilt thou fare than ever,<BR>
By the side of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Artist husband, metal-master,<BR>
Bread-provider of thy table,<BR>
On the arm of the fish-catcher,<BR>
On the breast of the elk-hunter,<BR>
By the side of the bear-killer.<BR>
Thou hast won the best of suitors,<BR>
Hast obtained a mighty hero;<BR>
Never idle is his cross-bow,<BR>
On the nails his quivers hang not,<BR>
Neither are his dogs in kennel,<BR>
Active agents is his bunting.<BR>
Thrice within the budding spring-time<BR>
In the early hours of morning<BR>
He arises from his fare-couch,<BR>
From his slumber in the brush-wood,<BR>
Thrice within the sowing season,<BR>
On his eyes the deer has fallen,<BR>
And the branches brushed his vesture,<BR>
And his locks been combed by fir-boughs.<BR>
Hasten homeward with thy husband,<BR>
Where thy hero's friends await thee,<BR>
Where his forests sing thy welcome.</P>
<P>"Ilmarinen there possesses<BR>
All the birds that fly in mid-air,<BR>
All the beasts that haunt the woodlands,<BR>
All that feed upon the mountains,<BR>
All that graze on hill and valley,<BR>
Sheep and cattle by the thousands;<BR>
Sweet the grass upon his meadows,<BR>
Sweet the barley in his uplands,<BR>
In the lowlands corn abundant,<BR>
Wheat upon the elm-wood fallows,<BR>
Near the streamlets rye is waving,<BR>
Waving grain on many acres,<BR>
On his mountains gold and silver,<BR>
Rich his mines of shining copper,<BR>
Highlands filled with magic metals,<BR>
Chests of jewels in his store-house,<BR>
All the wealth of Kalevala."</P>
