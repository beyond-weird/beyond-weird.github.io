<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE UNWELCOME GUEST.</H1>
<P>I HAVE brought young Kaukomieli,<BR>
Brought the Islander and hero,<BR>
Also known as Lemminkainen,<BR>
Through the jaws of death and ruin,<BR>
Through the darkling deeps of Kalma,<BR>
To the homesteads of Pohyola,<BR>
To the dismal courts of Louhi;<BR>
Now must I relate his doings,<BR>
Must relate to all my bearers,<BR>
How the merry Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Wandered through Pohyola's chambers,<BR>
Through the halls of Sariola,<BR>
How the hero went unbidden<BR>
To the feasting and carousal,<BR>
Uninvited to the banquet.</P>
<P>Lemminkainen full of courage,<BR>
Full of life, and strength, and magic.<BR>
Stepped across the ancient threshold,<BR>
To the centre of the court-room,<BR>
And the floors of linwood trembled,<BR>
Walls and ceilings creaked and murmured.</P>
<P>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
These the words that Ahti uttered:<BR>
"Be ye greeted on my coming,<BR>
Ye that greet, be likewise greeted!<BR>
Listen, all ye hosts of Pohya;<BR>
Is there food about this homestead,<BR>
Barley for my hungry courser,<BR>
Beer to give a thirsty stranger?</P>
<P>Sat the host of Sariola<BR>
At the east end of the table,<BR>
Gave this answer to the questions:<BR>
"Surely is there in this homestead,<BR>
For thy steed an open stable,<BR>
Never will this host refuse thee,<BR>
Shouldst thou act a part becoming,<BR>
Worthy, coming to these portals,<BR>
Waiting near the birchen rafters,<BR>
In the spaces by the kettles,<BR>
By the triple hooks of iron."</P>
<P>Then the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
Shook his sable locks and answered:<BR>
"Lempo may perchance come hither,<BR>
Let him fill this lowly station,<BR>
Let him stand between the kettles,<BR>
That with soot he may be blackened.<BR>
Never has my ancient father,<BR>
Never has the dear old hero,<BR>
Stood upon a spot unworthy,<BR>
At the portals near the rafters;<BR>
For his steed the best of stables,<BR>
Food and shelter gladly furnished,<BR>
And a room for his attendants,<BR>
Corners furnished for his mittens,<BR>
Hooks provided for his snow-shoes,<BR>
Halls in waiting for his helmet.<BR>
Wherefore then should I not find here<BR>
What my father found before me?"</P>
<P>To the centre walked the hero,<BR>
Walked around the dining table,<BR>
Sat upon a bench and waited,<BR>
On a bench of polished fir-wood,<BR>
And the kettle creaked beneath him.<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"As a guest am I unwelcome,<BR>
Since the waiters bring no viands,<BR>
Bring no dishes to the stranger?"</P>
<P>Ilpotar, the Northland hostess,<BR>
Then addressed the words that follow:<BR>
"Lemminkainen, thou art evil,<BR>
Thou art here, but not invited,<BR>
Thou hast not the look of kindness,<BR>
Thou wilt give me throbbing temples,<BR>
Thou art bringing pain and sorrow.<BR>
All our beer is in the barley,<BR>
All the malt is in the kernel,<BR>
All our grain is still ungarnered,<BR>
And our dinner has been eaten;<BR>
Yesterday thou shouldst have been here,<BR>
Come again some future season."</P>
<P>Whereupon wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Pulled his mouth awry in anger,<BR>
Shook his coal-black locks and answered:<BR>
"All the tables here are empty,<BR>
And the feasting-time is over;<BR>
All the beer has left the goblets,<BR>
Empty too are all the pitchers,<BR>
Empty are the larger vessels.<BR>
O thou hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Toothless dame of dismal Northland,<BR>
Badly managed is thy wedding,<BR>
And thy feast is ill-conducted,<BR>
Like the dogs hast thou invited;<BR>
Thou hast baked the honey-biscuit,<BR>
Wheaten loaves of greatest virtue,<BR>
Brewed thy beer from hops and barley,<BR>
Sent abroad thine invitations,<BR>
Six the hamlets thou hast honored,<BR>
Nine the villages invited<BR>
By thy merry wedding-callers.<BR>
Thou hast asked the poor and lowly,<BR>
Asked the hosts of common people,<BR>
Asked the blind, and deaf, and crippled,<BR>
Asked a multitude of beggars,<BR>
Toilers by the day, and hirelings;<BR>
Asked the men of evil habits,<BR>
Asked the maids with braided tresses,<BR>
I alone was not invited.<BR>
How could such a slight be given,<BR>
Since I sent thee kegs of barley?<BR>
Others sent thee grain in cupfuls,<BR>
Brought it sparingly in dippers,<BR>
While I sent thee fullest measure,<BR>
Sent the half of all my garners,<BR>
Of the richest of my harvest,<BR>
Of the grain that I had gathered.<BR>
Even now young Lemminkainen,<BR>
Though a guest of name and station<BR>
Has no beer, no food, no welcome,<BR>
Naught for him art thou preparing,<BR>
Nothing cooking in thy kettles,<BR>
Nothing brewing in thy cellars<BR>
For the hero of the Islands,<BR>
At the closing of his journey."</P>
<P>Ilpotar, the ancient hostess,<BR>
Gave this order to her servants:<BR>
"Come, my pretty maiden-waiter,<BR>
Servant-girl to me belonging,<BR>
Lay some salmon to the broiling,<BR>
Bring some beer to give the stranger!"</P>
<P>Small of stature was the maiden,<BR>
Washer of the banquet-platters,<BR>
Rinser of the dinner-ladles,<BR>
Polisher of spoons of silver,<BR>
And she laid some food in kettles,<BR>
Only bones and beads of whiting,<BR>
Turnip-stalks and withered cabbage,<BR>
Crusts of bread and bits of biscuit.<BR>
Then she brought some beer in pitchers,<BR>
Brought of common drink the vilest,<BR>
That the stranger, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Might have drink, and meat in welcome,<BR>
Thus to still his thirst and hunger.<BR>
Then the maiden spake as follows:<BR>
"Thou art sure a mighty hero,<BR>
Here to drink the beer of Pohya,<BR>
Here to empty all our vessels!"</P>
<P>Then the minstrel, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Closely handled all the pitchers,<BR>
Looking to the very bottoms;<BR>
There beheld he writhing serpents,<BR>
In the centre adders swimming,<BR>
On the borders worms and lizards.<BR>
Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Filled with anger, spake as follows:<BR>
Get ye hence, ye things of evil,<BR>
Get ye hence to Tuonela,<BR>
With the bearer of these pitchers,<BR>
With the maid that brought ye hither,<BR>
Ere the evening moon has risen,<BR>
Ere the day-star seeks the ocean!<BR>
0 thou wretched beer of barley,<BR>
Thou hast met with great dishonor,<BR>
Into disrepute hast fallen,<BR>
But I'll drink thee, notwithstanding,<BR>
And the rubbish cast far from me."</P>
<P>Then the hero to his pockets<BR>
Thrust his first and unnamed finger,<BR>
Searching in his pouch of leather;<BR>
Quick withdraws a hook for fishing,<BR>
Drops it to the pitcher's bottom,<BR>
Through the worthless beer of barley;<BR>
On his fish-book hang the serpents,<BR>
Catches many hissing adders,<BR>
Catches frogs in magic numbers,<BR>
Catches blackened worms in thousands,<BR>
Casts them to the floor before him,<BR>
Quickly draws his heavy broad sword,<BR>
And decapitates the serpents.</P>
<P>Now he drinks the beer remaining,<BR>
When the wizard speaks as follows:<BR>
"As a guest am I unwelcome,<BR>
Since no beer to me is given<BR>
That is worthy of a hero;<BR>
Neither has a ram been butchered,<BR>
Nor a fattened calf been slaughtered,<BR>
Worthy food for Lemminkainen."</P>
<P>Then the landlord of Pohyola<BR>
Answered thus the Island-minstrel:<BR>
"Wherefore hast thou journeyed hither,<BR>
Who has asked thee for thy presence?<BR>
Spake in answer Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Happy is the guest invited,<BR>
Happier when not expected;<BR>
Listen, son of Pohylander,<BR>
Host of Sariola, listen:<BR>
Give me beer for ready payment,<BR>
Give me worthy drink for money!"</P>
<P>Then the landlord of Pohyola,<BR>
In bad humor, full of anger,<BR>
Conjured in the earth a lakelet,<BR>
At the feet of Kaukomieli,<BR>
Thus addressed the Island-hero:<BR>
"Quench thy thirst from yonder lakelet,<BR>
There, the beer that thou deservest!"</P>
<P>Little heeding, Lemminkainen<BR>
To this insolence made answer:<BR>
"I am neither bear nor roebuck,<BR>
That should drink this filthy water,<BR>
Drink the water of this lakelet."</P>
<P>Ahti then began to conjure,<BR>
Conjured he a bull before him,<BR>
Bull with horns of gold and silver,<BR>
And the bull drank from the lakelet,<BR>
Drank he from the pool in pleasure.<BR>
Then the landlord of Pohyola<BR>
There a savage wolf created,<BR>
Set him on the floor before him<BR>
To destroy the bull of magic,<BR>
Lemminkainen, full of courage,<BR>
Conjured up a snow-white rabbit,<BR>
Set him on the floor before him<BR>
To attract the wolf's attention.<BR>
Then the landlord of Pohyola<BR>
Conjured there a dog of Lempo,<BR>
Set him on the floor before him<BR>
To destroy the magic rabbit.<BR>
Lemminkainen, full of mischief,<BR>
Conjured on the roof a squirrel,<BR>
That by jumping on the rafters<BR>
He might catch the dog's attention.<BR>
But the master of the Northland<BR>
Conjured there a golden marten,<BR>
And he drove the magic squirrel<BR>
From his seat upon the rafters.<BR>
Lemminkainen, full of mischief,<BR>
Made a fox of scarlet color,<BR>
And it ate the golden marten.<BR>
Then the master of Pohyola<BR>
Conjured there a hen to flutter<BR>
Near the fox of scarlet color.<BR>
Lemminkainen, full of mischief,<BR>
Thereupon a hawk created,<BR>
That with beak and crooked talons<BR>
He might tear the hen to pieces.</P>
<P>Spake the landlord of Pohyola,<BR>
These the words the tall man uttered:<BR>
"Never will this feast be bettered<BR>
Till the guests are less in number;<BR>
I must do my work as landlord,<BR>
Get thee hence, thou evil stranger,<BR>
Cease thy conjurings of evil,<BR>
Leave this banquet of my people,<BR>
Haste away, thou wicked wizard,<BR>
To thine Island-home and people!<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Thus no hero will be driven,<BR>
Not a son of any courage<BR>
Will be frightened by thy presence,<BR>
Will be driven from thy banquet."</P>
<P>Then the landlord of Pohyola<BR>
Snatched his broadsword from the rafters,<BR>
Drew it rashly from the scabbard,<BR>
Thus addressing Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Ahti, Islander of evil,<BR>
Thou the handsome Kaukomieli,<BR>
Let us measure then our broadswords,<BR>
Let our skill be fully tested;<BR>
Surely is my broadsword better<BR>
Than the blade within thy scabbard."<BR>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen.<BR>
"That my blade is good and trusty,<BR>
Has been proved on heads of heroes,<BR>
Has on many bones been tested;<BR>
Be that as it may, my fellow,<BR>
Since thine order is commanding,<BR>
Let our swords be fully tested,<BR>
Let us see whose blade is better.<BR>
Long ago my hero-father<BR>
Tested well this sword in battle,<BR>
Never failing in a conflict.<BR>
Should his son be found less worthy?"</P>
<P>Then he grasped his mighty broadsword,<BR>
Drew the fire-blade from the scabbard<BR>
Hanging from his belt of copper.<BR>
Standing on their hilts their broadswords,<BR>
Carefully their blades were measured,<BR>
Found the sword of Northland's master<BR>
Longer than the sword of Ahti<BR>
By the half-link of a finger.<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen.<BR>
"Since thou hast the longer broadsword,<BR>
Thou shalt make the first advances,<BR>
I am ready for thy weapon."</P>
<P>Thereupon Pohyola's landlord<BR>
With the wondrous strength of anger,<BR>
Tried in vain to slay the hero,<BR>
Strike the crown of Lemminkainen;<BR>
Chipped the splinters from the rafters,<BR>
Cut the ceiling into fragments,<BR>
Could not touch the Island-hero.</P>
<P>Thereupon brave Kaukomieli,<BR>
Thus addressed Pohyola's master:<BR>
"Have the rafters thee offended?<BR>
What the crimes they have committed,<BR>
Since thou hewest them in pieces?<BR>
Listen now, thou host of Northland,<BR>
Reckless landlord of Pohyola,<BR>
Little room there is for swordsmen<BR>
In these chambers filled with women;<BR>
We shall stain these painted rafters,<BR>
Stain with blood these floors and ceilings;<BR>
Let us go without the mansion,<BR>
In the field is room for combat,<BR>
On the plain is space sufficient;<BR>
Blood looks fairer in the court-yard,<BR>
Better in the open spaces,<BR>
Let it dye the snow-fields scarlet."</P>
<P>To the yard the heroes hasten,<BR>
There they find a monstrous ox-skin,<BR>
Spread it on the field of battle;<BR>
On the ox-skin stand the swordsmen.<BR>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Listen well, thou host of Northland,<BR>
Though thy broadsword is the longer,<BR>
Though thy blade is full of horror,<BR>
Thou shalt have the first advantage;<BR>
Use with skill thy boasted broadsword<BR>
Ere the final bout is given,<BR>
Ere thy head be chopped in pieces;<BR>
Strike with skill, or thou wilt perish,<BR>
Strike, and do thy best for Northland."</P>
<P>Thereupon Pohyola's landlord<BR>
Raised on high his blade of battle,<BR>
Struck a heavy blow in anger,<BR>
Struck a second, then a third time,<BR>
But he could not touch his rival,<BR>
Could Dot draw a single blood-drop<BR>
From the veins of Lemminkainen,<BR>
Skillful Islander and hero.<BR>
Spake the handsome Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Let me try my skill at fencing,<BR>
Let me swing my father's broadsword,<BR>
Let my honored blade be tested!"<BR>
But the landlord of Pohyola,<BR>
Does not heed the words of Ahti,<BR>
Strikes in fury, strikes unceasing,<BR>
Ever aiming, ever missing.<BR>
When the skillful Lemminkainen<BR>
Swings his mighty blade of magic,<BR>
Fire disports along his weapon,<BR>
Flashes from his sword of honor,<BR>
Glistens from the hero's broadsword,<BR>
Balls of fire disporting, dancing,<BR>
On the blade of mighty Ahti,<BR>
Overflow upon the shoulders<BR>
Of the landlord of Pohyola.<BR>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"O thou son of Sariola,<BR>
See! indeed thy neck is glowing<BR>
Like the dawning of the morning,<BR>
Like the rising Sun in ocean!"</P>
<P>Quickly turned Pohyola's landlord,<BR>
Thoughtless host of darksome Northland,<BR>
To behold the fiery splendor<BR>
Playing on his neck and shoulders.<BR>
Quick as lightning, Lemminkainen,<BR>
With his father's blade of battle,<BR>
With a single blow of broadsword,<BR>
With united skill and power,<BR>
Lopped the head of Pohya's master;<BR>
As one cleaves the stalks of turnips,<BR>
As the ear falls from the corn-stalk,<BR>
As one strikes the fins from salmon,<BR>
Thus the head rolled from the shoulders<BR>
Of the landlord of Pohyola,<BR>
Like a ball it rolled and circled.</P>
<P>In the yard were pickets standing,<BR>
Hundreds were the sharpened pillars,<BR>
And a head on every picket,<BR>
Only one was left un-headed.<BR>
Quick the victor, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Took the head of Pohya's landlord,<BR>
Spiked it on the empty picket.</P>
<P>Then the Islander, rejoicing,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Quick returning to the chambers,<BR>
Crave this order to the hostess:<BR>
"Evil maiden, bring me water,<BR>
Wherewithal to cleanse my fingers<BR>
From the blood of Northland's master,<BR>
Wicked host of Sariola."</P>
<P>Ilpotar, the Northland hostess,<BR>
Fired with anger, threatened vengeance,<BR>
Conjured men with heavy broadswords,<BR>
Heroes clad in copper-armor,<BR>
Hundred warriors with their javelins,<BR>
And a thousand bearing cross-bows,<BR>
To destroy the Island-hero,<BR>
For the death of Lemminkainen.<BR>
Kaukomieli soon discovered<BR>
That the time had come for leaving,<BR>
That his presence was unwelcome<BR>
At the feasting of Pohyola,<BR>
At the banquet of her people.</P>
