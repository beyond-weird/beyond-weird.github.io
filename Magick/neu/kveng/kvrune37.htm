<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">RUNE XXXVII.</H1>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">ILMARINEN'S BRIDE OF GOLD.</H1>
<P>ILMARINEN, metal-worker,<BR>
Wept one day, and then a second,<BR>
Wept the third from morn till evening,<BR>
O'er the death of his companion,<BR>
Once the Maiden of the Rainbow;<BR>
Did not swing his heavy hammer,<BR>
Did not touch its copper handle,<BR>
Made no sound within his smithy,<BR>
Made no blow upon his anvil,<BR>
Till three months had circled over;<BR>
Then the blacksmith spake as follows:<BR>
"Woe is me, unhappy hero!<BR>
Do not know how I can prosper;<BR>
Long the days, and cold, and dreary,<BR>
Longer still the nights, and colder;<BR>
I am weary in the evening,<BR>
In the morning still am weary,<BR>
Have no longing for the morning,<BR>
And the evening is unwelcome;<BR>
Have no pleasure in the future,<BR>
All my pleasures gone forever,<BR>
With my faithful life-companion<BR>
Slaughtered by the hand of witchcraft!<BR>
Often will my heart-strings quiver<BR>
When I rest within my chamber,<BR>
When I wake at dreamy midnight,<BR>
Half-unconscious, vainly searching<BR>
For my noble wife departed."</P>
<P>Wifeless lived the mourning blacksmith,<BR>
Altered in his form and features;<BR>
Wept one month and then another,<BR>
Wept three months in full succession.<BR>
Then the magic metal-worker<BR>
Gathered gold from deeps of ocean,<BR>
Gathered silver from the mountains,<BR>
Gathered many heaps of birch-wood.<BR>
Filled with faggots thirty sledges,<BR>
Burned the birch-wood into ashes,<BR>
Put the ashes in the furnace,<BR>
Laid the gold upon the embers,<BR>
Lengthwise laid a piece of silver<BR>
Of the size of lambs in autumn,<BR>
Or the fleet-foot hare in winter;<BR>
Places servants at the bellows,<BR>
Thus to melt the magic metals.<BR>
Eagerly the servants labor,<BR>
Gloveless, hatless, do the workmen<BR>
Fan the flames within the furnace.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, magic blacksmith,<BR>
Works unceasing at his forging,<BR>
Thus to mould a golden image,<BR>
Mould a bride from gold and silver;<BR>
But the workmen fail their master,<BR>
Faithless stand they at the bellows.<BR>
Wow the artist, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Fans the flame with force of magic,<BR>
Blows one day, and then a second,<BR>
Blows the third from morn till even;<BR>
Then he looks within the furnace,<BR>
Looks around the oven-border,<BR>
Hoping there to see an image<BR>
Rising from the molten metals.</P>
<P>Comes a lambkin from the furnace,<BR>
Rising from the fire of magic,<BR>
Wearing hair of gold and copper,<BR>
Laced with many threads of silver;<BR>
All rejoice but Ilmarinen<BR>
At the beauty of the image.<BR>
This the language of the blacksmith:<BR>
"May the wolf admire thy graces;<BR>
I desire a bride of beauty<BR>
Born from molten gold and silver!"</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, the magician,<BR>
To the furnace threw the lambkin;<BR>
Added gold in great abundance,<BR>
And increased the mass of silver,<BR>
Added other magic metals,<BR>
Set the workmen at the bellows;<BR>
Zealously the servants labor,<BR>
Gloveless, hatless, do the workmen<BR>
Fan the flames within the furnace.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, wizard-forgeman,<BR>
Works unceasing with his metals,<BR>
Moulding well a golden image,<BR>
Wife of molten gold and silver;<BR>
But the workmen fail their master,<BR>
Faithless do they ply the bellows.</P>
<P>Now the artist, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Fans the flames by force of magic;<BR>
Blows one day, and then a second,<BR>
Blows a third from morn till evening,<BR>
When he looks within the furnace,<BR>
Looks around the oven-border,<BR>
Hoping there, to see an image<BR>
Rising from the molten metals.<BR>
From the flames a colt arises,<BR>
Golden-maned and silver-headed,<BR>
Hoofs are formed of shining copper.<BR>
All rejoice but Ilmarinen<BR>
At the wonderful creation;<BR>
This the language of the blacksmith;<BR>
"Let the bears admire thy graces;<BR>
I desire a bride of beauty<BR>
Born of many magic metals."</P>
<P>Thereupon the wonder-forger<BR>
Drives the colt back to the furnace,<BR>
Adds a greater mass of silver,<BR>
And of gold the rightful measure,<BR>
Sets the workmen at the bellows.<BR>
Eagerly the servants labor,<BR>
Gloveless, hatless, do the workmen<BR>
Fan the flames within the furnace.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, the magician,<BR>
Works unceasing at his witchcraft,<BR>
Moulding well a golden maiden,<BR>
Bride of molten gold and silver;<BR>
But the workmen fail their master,<BR>
Faithlessly they ply the bellows.</P>
<P>Now the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Fans the flames with magic powers,<BR>
Blows one day, and then a second,<BR>
Blows a third from morn till even;<BR>
Then he looks within his furnace,<BR>
Looks around the oven-border,<BR>
Trusting there to see a maiden<BR>
Coming from the molten metals.<BR>
From the fire a virgin rises,<BR>
Golden-haired and silver-headed,<BR>
Beautiful in form and feature.<BR>
All are filled with awe and wonder,<BR>
But the artist and magician.<BR>
Ilmarinen, metal-worker,<BR>
Forges nights and days unceasing,<BR>
On the bride of his creation;<BR>
Feet he forges for the maiden,<BR>
Hands and arms, of gold and silver;<BR>
But her feet are not for walking,<BR>
Neither can her arms embrace him.<BR>
Ears he forges for the virgin,<BR>
But her ears are not for hearing;<BR>
Forges her a mouth of beauty,<BR>
Eyes he forges bright and sparkling;<BR>
But the magic mouth is speechless,<BR>
And the eyes are not for seeing.<BR>
Spake the artist, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"This, indeed, a priceless maiden,<BR>
Could she only speak in wisdom,<BR>
Could she breathe the breath of Ukko!"</P>
<P>Thereupon he lays the virgin<BR>
On his silken couch of slumber,<BR>
On his downy place of resting.<BR>
Ilmarinen heats his bath-room,<BR>
Makes it ready for his service,<BR>
Binds together silken brushes,<BR>
Brings three cans of crystal water,<BR>
Wherewithal to lave the image,<BR>
Lave the golden maid of beauty.<BR>
When this task had been completed,<BR>
Ilmarinen, hoping, trusting,<BR>
Laid his golden bride to slumber,<BR>
On his downy couch of resting;<BR>
Ordered many silken wrappings,<BR>
Ordered bear-skins, three in number,<BR>
Ordered seven lambs-wool blankets,<BR>
Thus to keep him warm in slumber,<BR>
Sleeping by the golden image<BR>
Re had forged from magic metals.<BR>
Warm the side of Ilmarinen<BR>
That was wrapped in furs and blankets;<BR>
Chill the parts beside the maiden,<BR>
By his bride of gold and silver;<BR>
One side warm, the other lifeless,<BR>
Turning into ice from coldness.<BR>
Spake the artist, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Not for me was born this virgin<BR>
From the magic molten metals;<BR>
I shall take her to Wainola,<BR>
Give her to old Wainamoinen,<BR>
As a bride and life-companion,<BR>
Comfort to him in his dotage."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, much disheartened,<BR>
Takes the virgin to Wainola,<BR>
To the plains of Kalevala,<BR>
To his brother speaks as follows:<BR>
"O, thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Look with favor on this image;<BR>
Make the maiden fair and lovely,<BR>
Beautiful in form and feature,<BR>
Suited to thy years declining!"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Looked in wonder on the virgin,<BR>
On the golden bride of beauty,<BR>
Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Wherefore dost thou bring this maiden,<BR>
Wherefore bring to Wainamoinen<BR>
Bride of molten gold and silver?<BR>
Spake in answer Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Wherefore should I bring this image,<BR>
But for purposes the noblest?<BR>
I have brought her as companion<BR>
To thy life in years declining,<BR>
As a joy and consolation,<BR>
When thy days are full of trouble!"<BR>
Spake the good, old Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Magic brother, wonder-forger,<BR>
Throw the virgin to the furnace,<BR>
To the flames, thy golden image,<BR>
Forge from her a thousand trinkets.<BR>
Take the image into Ehstland,<BR>
Take her to the plains of Pohya,<BR>
That for her the mighty powers<BR>
May engage in deadly contest,<BR>
Worthy trophy for the victor;<BR>
Not for me this bride of wonder,<BR>
Neither for my worthy people.<BR>
I shall never wed an image<BR>
Born from many magic metals,<BR>
Never wed a silver maiden,<BR>
Never wed a golden virgin."<BR>
Then the hero of the waters<BR>
Called together all his people,<BR>
Spake these words of ancient wisdom:<BR>
"Every child of Northland, listen,<BR>
Whether poor, or fortune-favored:<BR>
Never bow before an image<BR>
Born of molten gold and silver:<BR>
Never while the sunlight brightens,<BR>
Never while the moonlight glimmers,<BR>
Choose a maiden of the metals,<BR>
Choose a bride from gold created<BR>
Cold the lips of golden maiden,<BR>
Silver breathes the breath of sorrow."</P>
