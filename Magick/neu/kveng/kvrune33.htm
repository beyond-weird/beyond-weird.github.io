<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">KULLERVO AND THE CHEAT-CAKE.</H1>
<P>THEREUPON the lad, Kullervo,<BR>
Laid his luncheon in his basket,<BR>
Drove the herd to mountain-pastures,<BR>
O'er the hills and through the marshes,<BR>
To their grazings in the woodlands,<BR>
Speaking as he careless wandered:<BR>
"Of the youth am I the poorest,<BR>
Hapless lad and full of trouble,<BR>
Evil luck to me befallen!<BR>
I alas! must idly wander<BR>
O'er the hills and through the valleys,<BR>
As a watch-dog for the cattle!"</P>
<P>Then she sat upon the greensward,<BR>
In a sunny spot selected,<BR>
Singing, chanting words as follow:<BR>
"Shine, O shine, thou Sun of heaven,<BR>
Cast thy rays, thou fire of Ukko,<BR>
On the herdsman of the blacksmith,<BR>
On the head of Kullerwoinen,<BR>
On this poor and luckless shepherd,<BR>
Not in Ilmarinen's smithy,<BR>
Nor the dwellings of his people;<BR>
Good the table of the hostess,<BR>
Cuts the best of wheaten biscuit,<BR>
Honey-cakes she cuts in slices,<BR>
Spreading each with golden butter;<BR>
Only dry bread has the herdsman,<BR>
Eats with pain the oaten bread-crusts,'<BR>
Filled with chaff his and biscuit,<BR>
Feeds upon the worst of straw-bread,<BR>
Pine-tree bark, the broad he feeds on,<BR>
Sipping water from the birch-bark,<BR>
Drinking from the tips of grasses I<BR>
Go, O Sun, and go, O barley,<BR>
Haste away, thou light of Ukko,<BR>
Hide within the mountain pine-trees,<BR>
Go, O wheat, to yonder thickets,<BR>
To the trees of purple berries,<BR>
To the junipers and alders,<BR>
Safely lead the herdsman homeward<BR>
To the biscuit golden-buttered,<BR>
To the honeyed cakes and viands!"</P>
<P>While the shepherd lad was singing<BR>
Kullerwoinen's song and echo,<BR>
Ilmarinen's wife was feasting<BR>
On the sweetest bread of Northland,<BR>
On the toothsome cakes of barley,<BR>
On the richest of provisions;<BR>
Only laid aside some cabbage,<BR>
For the herdsman, Kullerwoinen;<BR>
Set apart some wasted fragments,<BR>
Leavings of the dogs at dinner,<BR>
For the shepherd, home returning.</P>
<P>From the woods a bird came flying,<BR>
Sang this song to Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"'Tis the time for forest-dinners,<BR>
For the fatherless companion<BR>
Of the herds to eat his viands,<BR>
Eat the good things from his basket!"</P>
<P>Kullerwoinen heard the songster,<BR>
Looked upon the Sun's long shadow,<BR>
Straightway spake the words that follow:<BR>
"True, the singing of the song-bird,<BR>
It is time indeed for feasting,<BR>
Time to eat my basket-dinner."</P>
<P>Thereupon young Kullerwoinen<BR>
Called his herd to rest in safety,<BR>
Sat upon a grassy hillock,<BR>
Took his basket from his shoulders,<BR>
Took therefrom the and oat-loaf,<BR>
Turned it over in his fingers,<BR>
Carefully the loaf inspected,<BR>
Spake these words of ancient wisdom:<BR>
"Many loaves are fine to look on,<BR>
On the outside seem delicious,<BR>
On the inside, chaff and tan-bark!"</P>
<P>Then the shepherd, Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Drew his knife to cut his oat-loaf,<BR>
Cut the hard and arid biscuit;<BR>
Cuts against a stone imprisoned,<BR>
Well imbedded in the centre,<BR>
Breaks his ancient knife in pieces;<BR>
When the shepherd youth, Kullervo,<BR>
Saw his magic knife had broken,<BR>
Weeping sore, he spake as follows:<BR>
"This, the blade that I bold sacred,<BR>
This the one thing that I honor,<BR>
Relic of my mother's people!<BR>
On the stone within this oat-loaf,<BR>
On this cheat-cake of the hostess,<BR>
I my precious knife have broken.<BR>
How shall I repay this insult,<BR>
How avenge this woman's malice,<BR>
What the wages for deception?"<BR>
From a tree the raven answered:<BR>
"O thou little silver buckle,<BR>
Only son of old Kalervo,<BR>
Why art thou in evil humor,<BR>
Wherefore sad in thy demeanor?<BR>
Take a young shoot from the thicket,<BR>
Take a birch-rod from the valley,<BR>
Drive thy herd across the lowlands,<BR>
Through the quicksands of the marshes;<BR>
To the wolves let one half wander,<BR>
To the bear-dens, lead the other;<BR>
Sing the forest wolves together,<BR>
Sing the bears down from the mountains,<BR>
Call the wolves thy little children,<BR>
And the bears thy standard-bearers;<BR>
Drive them like a cow-herd homeward,<BR>
Drive them home like spotted cattle,<BR>
Drive them to thy master's milk-yards;<BR>
Thus thou wilt repay the hostess<BR>
For her malice and derision."</P>
<P>Thereupon the wizard answered,<BR>
These the words of Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"Wait, yea wait, thou bride of Hisi!<BR>
Do I mourn my mother's relic,<BR>
Mourn the keep-sake thou hast broken?<BR>
Thou thyself shalt mourn as sorely<BR>
When thy, cows come home at evening!"</P>
<P>From the tree he cuts a birch-wand,<BR>
From the juniper a whip-stick,<BR>
Drives the herd across the lowlands,<BR>
Through the quicksands of the marshes,<BR>
To the wolves lets one half wander,<BR>
To the bear-dens leads the other;<BR>
Calls the wolves his little children,<BR>
Calls the bears his standard-bearers,<BR>
Changes all his herd of cattle<BR>
Into wolves and bears by magic.</P>
<P>In the west the Sun is shining,<BR>
Telling that the night is coming.<BR>
Quick the wizard, Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Wanders o'er the pine-tree mountain,<BR>
Hastens through the forest homeward,<BR>
Drives the wolves and bears before him<BR>
Toward the milk-yards of the hostess;<BR>
To the herd he speaks as follows,<BR>
As they journey on together:<BR>
"Tear and kill the wicked hostess,<BR>
Tear her guilty flesh in pieces,<BR>
When she comes to view her cattle,<BR>
When she stoops to do her milking!"</P>
<P>Then the wizard, Kullerwoinen,<BR>
From an ox-bone makes a bugle,<BR>
Makes it from Tuonikki's cow-horn,<BR>
Makes a flute from Kiryo's shin-bone,<BR>
Plays a song upon his bugle,<BR>
Plays upon his flute of magic,<BR>
Thrice upon the home-land hill-tops,<BR>
Six times near the coming gate-ways.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen's wife and hostess<BR>
Long had waited for the coming<BR>
Of her herd with Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Waited for the milk at evening,<BR>
Waited for the new-made butter,<BR>
Heard the footsteps in the cow-path,<BR>
On the heath she beard the bustle,<BR>
Spake these joyous words of welcome:<BR>
"Be thou praised, O gracious Ukko,<BR>
That my herd is home returning!<BR>
But I hear a bugle sounding,<BR>
'Tis the playing of my herdsman,<BR>
Playing on a magic cow-horn,<BR>
Bursting all our ears with music!"</P>
<P>Kullerwoinen, drawing nearer,<BR>
To the hostess spake as follows:<BR>
"Found the bugle in the woodlands,<BR>
And the flute among the rushes;<BR>
All thy herd are in the passage,<BR>
All thy cows within the hurdles,<BR>
This the time to build the camp-fire,<BR>
This the time to do the milking!"</P>
<P>Ilmarinen's wife, the hostess,<BR>
Thus addressed an aged servant:<BR>
"Go, thou old one, to the milking,<BR>
Have the care of all my cattle,<BR>
Do not ask for mine assistance,<BR>
Since I have to knead the biscuit."<BR>
Kullerwoinen spake as follows:<BR>
"Always does the worthy hostess,<BR>
Ever does the wisdom-mother<BR>
Go herself and do the milking,<BR>
Tend the cows within the hurdles!"</P>
<P>Then the wife of Ilmarinen<BR>
Built a field-fire in the passage,<BR>
Went to milk her cows awaiting,<BR>
Looked upon her herd in wonder,<BR>
Spake these happy words of greeting:<BR>
"Beautiful, my herd of cattle,<BR>
Glistening like the skins of lynxes,<BR>
Hair as soft as fur of ermine,<BR>
Peaceful waiting for the milk-pail!"</P>
<P>On the milk-stool sits the hostess,<BR>
Milks one moment, then a second,<BR>
Then a third time milks and ceases;<BR>
When the bloody wolves disguising,<BR>
Quick attack the hostess milking,<BR>
And the bears lend their assistance,<BR>
Tear and mutilate her body<BR>
With their teeth and sharpened fingers.<BR>
Kullerwoinen, cruel wizard,<BR>
Thus repaid the wicked hostess,<BR>
Thus repaid her evil treatment.</P>
<P>Quick the wife of Ilmarinen<BR>
Cried aloud in bitter anguish,<BR>
Thus addressed the youth, Kullervo:<BR>
"Evil son, thou bloody herdsman,<BR>
Thou hast brought me wolves in malice,<BR>
Driven bears within my hurdles!<BR>
These the words of Kullerwoinen:<BR>
"Have I evil done as shepherd,<BR>
Worse the conduct of the hostess;<BR>
Baked a stone inside my oat-cake,<BR>
On the inside, rock and tan-bark,<BR>
On the stone my knife, was broken,<BR>
Treasure of my mother's household,<BR>
Broken virtue of my people!"<BR>
Ilmarinen's wife made answer:<BR>
"Noble herdsman, Kullerwoinen,<BR>
Change, I pray thee, thine opinion,<BR>
Take away thine incantations,<BR>
From the bears and wolves release me,<BR>
Save me from this spell of torture<BR>
I will give thee better raiment,<BR>
Give the best of milk and butter,<BR>
Set for thee the sweetest table;<BR>
Thou shalt live with me in welcome,<BR>
Need not labor for thy keeping.<BR>
If thou dost not free me quickly,<BR>
Dost not break this spell of magic,<BR>
I shall sink into the Death-land,<BR>
Shall return to Tuonela."<BR>
This is Kullerwoinen's answer:<BR>
"It is best that thou shouldst perish,<BR>
Let destruction overtake thee,<BR>
There is ample room in Mana,<BR>
Room for all the dead in Kalma,<BR>
There the worthiest must slumber,<BR>
There must rest the good and evil."<BR>
Ilmarinen's wife made answer:<BR>
"Ukko, thou O God in heaven,<BR>
Span the strongest of thy cross-bows,<BR>
Test the weapon by thy wisdom,<BR>
Lay an arrow forged from copper,<BR>
On the cross-bow of thy forging;<BR>
Rightly aim thy flaming arrow,<BR>
With thy magic hurl the missile,<BR>
Shoot this wizard through the vitals,<BR>
Pierce the heart of Kullerwoinen<BR>
With the lightning of the heavens,<BR>
With thine arrows tipped with copper."<BR>
Kullerwoinen prays as follows:<BR>
"Ukko, God of truth and justice.<BR>
Do not slay thy magic servant,<BR>
Slay the wife of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Kill in her the worst of women,<BR>
In these hurdles let her perish,<BR>
Lest she wander hence in freedom,<BR>
To perform some other mischief,<BR>
Do some greater deed of malice!"</P>
<P>Quick as lightning fell the hostess,<BR>
Quick the wife of Ilmarinen<BR>
Fell and perished in the hurdles,<BR>
On the ground before her cottage<BR>
Thus the death of Northland's hostess,<BR>
Cherished wife of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Once the Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Wooed and watched for many summers,<BR>
Pride and joy of Kalevala!</P>
