<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WAINAMOINEN FINDS THE LOST-WORD.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, old and truthful,<BR>
Did not learn the words of magic<BR>
In Tuoni's gloomy regions,<BR>
In the kingdom of Manala.<BR>
Thereupon he long debated,<BR>
Well considered, long reflected,<BR>
Where to find the magic sayings;<BR>
When a shepherd came to meet him,<BR>
Speaking thus to Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Thou canst find of words a hundred,<BR>
Find a thousand wisdom-sayings,<BR>
In the mouth of wise Wipunen,<BR>
In the body of the hero;<BR>
To the spot I know the foot-path,<BR>
To his tomb the magic highway,<BR>
Trodden by a host of heroes;<BR>
Long the distance thou must travel,<BR>
On the sharpened points of needles;<BR>
Then a long way thou must journey<BR>
On the edges of the broadswords;<BR>
Thirdly thou must travel farther<BR>
On the edges of the hatchets."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and trustful,<BR>
Well considered all these journeys,<BR>
Travelled to the forge and smithy,<BR>
Thus addressed the metal-worker:<BR>
"Ilmarinen, worthy blacksmith,<BR>
Make a shoe for me of iron,<BR>
Forge me gloves of burnished copper,<BR>
Mold a staff of strongest metal,<BR>
Lay the steel upon the inside,<BR>
Forge within the might of magic;<BR>
I am going on a journey<BR>
To procure the magic sayings,<BR>
Find the lost-words of the Master,<BR>
From the mouth of the magician,<BR>
From the tongue of wise Wipunen."<BR>
Spake the artist, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Long ago died wise Wipunen,<BR>
Disappeared these many ages,<BR>
Lays no more his snares of copper,<BR>
Sets no longer traps of iron,<BR>
Cannot learn from him the wisdom,<BR>
Cannot find in him the lost-words."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and hopeful,<BR>
Little heeding, not discouraged,<BR>
In his metal shoes and armor,<BR>
Hastens forward on his journey,<BR>
Runs the first day fleetly onward,<BR>
On the sharpened points of needles;<BR>
'Wearily he strides the second,<BR>
On the edges of the broadswords<BR>
Swings himself the third day forward,<BR>
On the edges of the hatchets.</P>
<P>Wise Wipunen, wisdom-singer,<BR>
Ancient bard, and great magician,<BR>
With his magic songs lay yonder,<BR>
Stretched beside him, lay his sayings,<BR>
On his shoulder grew the aspen,<BR>
On each temple grew the birch-tree,<BR>
On his mighty chin the alder,<BR>
From his beard grew willow-bushes,<BR>
From his mouth the dark green fir-tree,<BR>
And the oak-tree from his forehead.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, coming closer,<BR>
Draws his sword, lays bare his hatchet<BR>
From his magic leathern scabbard,<BR>
Fells the aspen from his shoulder,<BR>
Fells the birch-tree from his temples,<BR>
From his chin he fells the alder,<BR>
From his beard, the branching willows,<BR>
From his mouth the dark-green fir-tree,<BR>
Fells the oak-tree from his forehead.</P>
<P>Now he thrusts his staff of iron<BR>
Through the mouth of wise Wipunen,<BR>
Pries his mighty jaws asunder,<BR>
Speaks these words of master-magic:<BR>
"Rise, thou master of magicians,<BR>
From the sleep of Tuonela,<BR>
From thine everlasting slumber!"</P>
<P>Wise Wipunen, ancient singer,<BR>
Quickly wakens from his sleeping,<BR>
Keenly feels the pangs of torture,<BR>
From the cruel staff of iron;<BR>
Bites with mighty force the metal,<BR>
Bites in twain the softer iron,<BR>
Cannot bite the steel asunder,<BR>
Opens wide his mouth in anguish.<BR>
Wainamoinen of Wainola,<BR>
In his iron-shoes and armor,<BR>
Careless walking, headlong stumbles<BR>
In the spacious mouth and fauces<BR>
Of the magic bard, Wipunen.<BR>
Wise Wipunen, full of song-charms,<BR>
Opens wide his mouth and swallows<BR>
Wainamoinen and his magic,<BR>
Shoes, and staff, and iron armor.<BR>
Then outspeaks the wise Wipunen:<BR>
"Many things before I've eaten,<BR>
Dined on goat, and sheep, and reindeer,<BR>
Bear, and ox, and wolf, and wild-boar,<BR>
Never in my recollection,<BR>
Have I tasted sweeter morsels!"<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Now I see the evil symbols,<BR>
See misfortune hanging o'er me,<BR>
In the darksome Hisi-hurdles,<BR>
In the catacombs of Kalma."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen long considered<BR>
How to live and how to prosper,<BR>
How to conquer this condition.<BR>
In his belt he wore a poniard,<BR>
With a handle hewn from birch-wood,<BR>
From the handle builds a vessel,<BR>
Builds a boat through magic science;<BR>
In this vessel rows he swiftly<BR>
Through the entrails of the hero,<BR>
Rows through every gland and vessel<BR>
Of the wisest of magicians.<BR>
Old Wipunen, master-singer,<BR>
Barely feels the hero's presence,<BR>
Gives no heed to Wainamoinen.<BR>
Then the artist of Wainola<BR>
Straightway sets himself to forging,<BR>
Sets at work to hammer metals;<BR>
Makes a smithy from his armor,<BR>
Of his sleeves he makes the bellows,<BR>
Makes the air-valve from his fur-coat,<BR>
From his stockings, makes the muzzle,<BR>
Uses knees instead of anvil,<BR>
Makes a hammer of his fore-arm;<BR>
Like the storm-wind roars the bellows,<BR>
Like the thunder rings the anvil;<BR>
Forges one day, then a second,<BR>
Forges till the third day closes,<BR>
In the body of Wipunen,<BR>
In the sorcerer's abdomen.</P>
<P>Old Wipunen, full of magic,<BR>
Speaks these words in wonder, guessing:<BR>
"Who art thou of ancient heroes,<BR>
Who of all the host of heroes?<BR>
Many heroes I have eaten,<BR>
And of men a countless number,<BR>
Have not eaten such as thou art;<BR>
Smoke arises from my nostrils,<BR>
From my mouth the fire is streaming,<BR>
In my throat are iron-clinkers.</P>
<P>"Go, thou monster, hence to wander,<BR>
Flee this place, thou plague of Northland,<BR>
Ere I go to seek thy mother,<BR>
Tell the ancient dame thy mischief;<BR>
She shall bear thine evil conduct,<BR>
Great the burden she shall carry;<BR>
Great a mother's pain and anguish,<BR>
When her child runs wild and lawless;<BR>
Cannot comprehend the meaning,<BR>
Nor this mystery unravel,<BR>
Why thou camest here, O monster,<BR>
Camest here to give me torture.<BR>
Art thou Hisi sent from heaven,<BR>
Some calamity from Ukko?<BR>
Art, perchance, some new creation,<BR>
Ordered here to do me evil?<BR>
If thou art some evil genius,<BR>
Some calamity from Ukko,<BR>
Sent to me by my Creator,<BR>
Then am I resigned to suffer<BR>
God does not forsake the worthy,<BR>
Does not ruin those that trust him,<BR>
Never are the good forsaken.<BR>
If by man thou wert created,<BR>
If some hero sent thee hither,<BR>
I shall learn thy race of evil,<BR>
Shall destroy thy wicked tribe-folk.</P>
<P>"Thence arose the violation,<BR>
Thence arose the first destruction,<BR>
Thence came all the evil-doings:<BR>
From the neighborhood of wizards,<BR>
From the homes of the magicians,<BR>
From the eaves of vicious spirits,<BR>
From the haunts of fortune-tellers,<BR>
From the cabins of the witches,<BR>
From the castles of Tuoni,<BR>
From the bottom of Manala,<BR>
From the ground with envy swollen,<BR>
From Ingratitude's dominions,<BR>
From the rocky shoals and quicksands,<BR>
From the marshes filled with danger,<BR>
From the cataract's commotion,<BR>
From the bear-caves in the mountains,<BR>
From the wolves within the thickets,<BR>
From the roarings of the pine-tree,<BR>
From the burrows of the fox-dog,<BR>
From the woodlands of the reindeer,<BR>
From the eaves and Hisi-hurdles,<BR>
From the battles of the giants,<BR>
From uncultivated pastures,<BR>
From the billows of the oceans,<BR>
From the streams of boiling waters,<BR>
From the waterfalls of Rutya,<BR>
From the limits of the storm-clouds,<BR>
From the pathways of the thunders,<BR>
From the flashings of the lightnings,<BR>
From the distant plains of Pohya,<BR>
From the fatal stream and whirlpool,<BR>
From the birthplace of Tuoni.</P>
<P>"Art thou coming from these places?<BR>
Hast thou, evil, hastened hither,<BR>
To the heart of sinless hero,<BR>
To devour my guiltless body,<BR>
To destroy this wisdom-singer?<BR>
Get thee hence, thou dog of Lempo,<BR>
Leave, thou monster from Manala,<BR>
Flee from mine immortal body,<BR>
Leave my liver, thing of evil,<BR>
In my body cease thy forging,<BR>
Cease this torture of my vitals,<BR>
Let me rest in peace and slumber.</P>
<P>"Should I want in means efficient,<BR>
Should I lack the magic power<BR>
To outroot thine evil genius,<BR>
I shall call a better hero,<BR>
Call upon a higher power,<BR>
To remove this dire misfortune,<BR>
To annihilate this monster.<BR>
I shall call the will of woman,<BR>
From the fields, the old-time heroes?<BR>
Mounted heroes from the sand-hills,<BR>
Thus to rescue me from danger,<BR>
From these pains and ceaseless tortures.</P>
<P>"If this force prove inefficient,<BR>
Should not drive thee from my body,<BR>
Come, thou forest, with thy heroes,<BR>
Come, ye junipers and pine-trees,<BR>
With your messengers of power,<BR>
Come, ye mountains, with your wood-nymphs,<BR>
Come, ye lakes, with all your mermaids,<BR>
Come, ye hundred ocean-spearmen,<BR>
Come, torment this son of Hisi,<BR>
Come and kill this evil monster.</P>
<P>"If this call is inefficient,<BR>
Does not drive thee from my vitals,<BR>
Rise, thou ancient water-mother,<BR>
With thy blue-cap from the ocean,<BR>
From the seas, the lakes, the rivers,<BR>
Bring protection to thy hero,<BR>
Comfort bring and full assistance,<BR>
That I guiltless may not suffer,<BR>
May not perish prematurely.</P>
<P>"Shouldst thou brave this invocation,<BR>
Kap&egrave;, daughter of Creation,<BR>
Come, thou beauteous, golden maiden,<BR>
Oldest of the race of women,<BR>
Come and witness my misfortunes,<BR>
Come and turn away this evil,<BR>
Come, remove this biting torment,<BR>
Take away this plague of Piru.</P>
<P>"If this call be disregarded,<BR>
If thou wilt not leave me guiltless,<BR>
Ukko, on the arch of heaven,<BR>
In the thunder-cloud dominions,<BR>
Come thou quickly, thou art needed,<BR>
Come, protect thy tortured hero,<BR>
Drive away this magic demon,<BR>
Banish ever his enchantment,<BR>
With his sword and flaming furnace,<BR>
With his fire-enkindling bellows.</P>
<P>"Go, thou demon, hence to wander,<BR>
Flee, thou plague of Northland heroes;<BR>
Never come again for shelter,<BR>
Nevermore build thou thy dwelling<BR>
In the body of Wipunen;<BR>
Take at once thy habitation<BR>
To the regions of thy kindred,<BR>
To thy distant fields and firesides;<BR>
When thy journey thou hast ended,<BR>
Gained the borders of thy country,<BR>
Gained the meads of thy Creator,<BR>
Give a signal of thy coming,<BR>
Rumble like the peals of thunder,<BR>
Glisten like the gleam of lightning,<BR>
Knock upon the outer portals,<BR>
Enter through the open windows,<BR>
Glide about the many chambers,<BR>
Seize the host and seize the hostess,<BR>
Knock their evil beads together,<BR>
Wring their necks and hurl their bodies<BR>
To the black-dogs of the forest.</P>
<P>"Should this prove of little value,<BR>
Hover like the bird of battle,<BR>
O'er the dwellings of the master,<BR>
Scare the horses from the mangers,<BR>
From the troughs affright the cattle,<BR>
Twist their tails, and horns, and forelocks,<BR>
Hurl their carcasses to Lempo.</P>
<P>"If some scourge the winds have sent me,<BR>
Sent me on the air of spring-tide,<BR>
Brought me by the frosts of winter,<BR>
Quickly journey whence thou camest,<BR>
On the air-path of the heavens,<BR>
Perching not upon some aspen,<BR>
Resting not upon the birch-tree;<BR>
Fly away to copper mountains,<BR>
That the copper-winds may nurse thee,<BR>
Waves of ether, thy protection.</P>
<P>"Didst those come from high Jumala,<BR>
From the hems of ragged snow-clouds,<BR>
Quick ascend beyond the cloud-space,<BR>
Quickly journey whence thou camest,<BR>
To the snow-clouds, crystal-sprinkled,<BR>
To the twinkling stars of heaven<BR>
There thy fire may burn forever,<BR>
There may flash thy forked lightnings,<BR>
In the Sun's undying furnace.</P>
<P>"Wert thou sent here by the spring-floods,<BR>
Driven here by river-torrents?<BR>
Quickly journey whence thou camest,<BR>
Quickly hasten to the waters,<BR>
To the borders of the rivers,<BR>
To the ancient water-mountain,<BR>
That the floods again may rock thee,<BR>
And thy water-mother nurse thee.</P>
<P>"Didst thou come from Kalma's kingdom,<BR>
From the castles of the death-land?<BR>
Haste thou back to thine own country,<BR>
To the Kalma-halls and castles,<BR>
To the fields with envy swollen,<BR>
Where contending armies perish.</P>
<P>"Art thou from the Hisi-woodlands,<BR>
From ravines in Lempo's forest,<BR>
From the thickets of the pine-wood,<BR>
From the dwellings of the fir-glen?<BR>
Quick retrace thine evil footsteps<BR>
To the dwellings of thy master,<BR>
To the thickets of thy kindred;<BR>
There thou mayest dwell at pleasure,<BR>
Till thy house decays about thee,<BR>
Till thy walls shall mould and crumble.</P>
<P>Evil genius, thee I banish,<BR>
Got thee hence, thou horrid monster,<BR>
To the caverns of the white-bear,<BR>
To the deep abysm of serpents,<BR>
To the vales, and swamps, and fenlands,<BR>
To the ever-silent waters,<BR>
To the hot-springs of the mountains,<BR>
To the dead-seas of the Northland,<BR>
To the lifeless lakes and rivers,<BR>
To the sacred stream and whirlpool.</P>
<P>"Shouldst thou find no place of resting,<BR>
I will banish thee still farther,<BR>
To the Northland's distant borders,<BR>
To the broad expanse of Lapland,<BR>
To the ever-lifeless deserts,<BR>
To the unproductive prairies,<BR>
Sunless, moonless, starless, lifeless,<BR>
In the dark abyss of Northland;<BR>
This for thee, a place befitting,<BR>
Pitch thy tents and feast forever<BR>
On the dead plains of Pohyola.</P>
<P>"Shouldst thou find no means of living,<BR>
I will banish thee still farther,<BR>
To the cataract of Rutya,<BR>
To the fire-emitting whirlpool,<BR>
Where the firs are ever falling,<BR>
To the windfalls of the forest;<BR>
Swim hereafter in the waters<BR>
Of the fire-emitting whirlpool,<BR>
Whirl thou ever in the current<BR>
Of the cataract's commotion,<BR>
In its foam and boiling waters.</P>
<P>Should this place be unbefitting,<BR>
I will drive thee farther onward,<BR>
To Tuoni's coal-black river,<BR>
To the endless stream of Mana,<BR>
Where thou shalt forever linger;<BR>
Thou canst never leave Manala,<BR>
Should I not thy head deliver,<BR>
Should I never pay thy ransom;<BR>
Thou canst never safely journey<BR>
Through nine brother-rams abutting,<BR>
Through nine brother-bulls opposing<BR>
Through nine brother-stallions thwarting,<BR>
Thou canst not re-cross Death-river<BR>
Thickly set with iron netting,<BR>
Interlaced with threads of copper.</P>
<P>"Shouldst thou ask for steeds for saddle,<BR>
Shouldst thou need a fleet-foot courser,<BR>
I will give thee worthy racers,<BR>
I will give thee saddle-horses;<BR>
Evil Hisi has a charger,<BR>
Crimson mane, and tail, and foretop,<BR>
Fire emitting from his nostrils,<BR>
As he prances through his pastures;<BR>
Hoofs are made of strongest iron,<BR>
Legs are made of steel and copper,<BR>
Quickly scales the highest mountains,<BR>
Darts like lightning through the valleys,<BR>
When a skilful master rides him.</P>
<P>"Should this steed be insufficient,<BR>
I will give thee Lempo's snow-shoes,<BR>
Give thee Hisi's shoes of elm-wood,<BR>
Give to thee the staff of Piru,<BR>
That with these thou mayest journey<BR>
Into Hisi's courts and castles,<BR>
To the woods and fields of Juutas;<BR>
If the rocks should rise before thee,<BR>
Dash the flinty rocks in pieces,<BR>
Hurl the fragments to the heavens;<BR>
If the branches cross thy pathway,<BR>
Make them turn aside in greeting;<BR>
If some mighty hero hail thee,<BR>
Hurl him headlong to the woodlands.</P>
<P>"Hasten hence, thou thing of evil,<BR>
Heinous monster, leave my body,<BR>
Ere the breaking of the morning<BR>
Ere the Sun awakes from slumber,<BR>
Ere the sinning of the cuckoo;<BR>
Haste away, thou plague of Northland,<BR>
Haste along the track of' moonbeams,<BR>
Wander hence, forever wander,<BR>
To the darksome fields or Pohya.</P>
<P>"If at once thou dost not leave me,<BR>
I will send the eagle's talons,<BR>
Send to thee the beaks of vultures,<BR>
To devour thine evil body,<BR>
Hurl thy skeleton to Hisi.<BR>
Much more quickly cruel Lempo<BR>
Left my vitals when commanded,<BR>
When I called the aid of Ukko,<BR>
Called the help of my Creator.<BR>
Flee, thou motherless offendant,<BR>
Flee, thou fiend of Sariola,<BR>
Flee, thou hound without a master,<BR>
Ere the morning sun arises,<BR>
Ere the Moon withdraws to slumber!"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient hero,<BR>
Speaks at last to old Wipunen:<BR>
"Satisfied am I to linger<BR>
In these old and spacious caverns,<BR>
Pleasant here my home and dwelling;<BR>
For my meat I have thy tissues,<BR>
Have thy heart, and spleen, and liver,<BR>
For my drink the blood of ages,<BR>
Goodly home for Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>"I shall set my forge and bellows<BR>
Deeper, deeper in thy vitals;<BR>
I shall swing my heavy hammer,<BR>
Swing it with a greater power<BR>
On thy heart, and lungs, and liver;<BR>
I shall never, never leave thee<BR>
Till I learn thine incantations,<BR>
Learn thy many wisdom-sayings,<BR>
Learn the lost-words of the Master;<BR>
Never must these words be bidden,<BR>
Earth must never lose this wisdom,<BR>
Though the wisdom-singers perish."</P>
<P>Old Wipunen, wise magician,<BR>
Ancient prophet, filled with power,<BR>
Opens fall his store of knowledge,<BR>
Lifts the covers from his cases,<BR>
Filled with old-time incantations,<BR>
Filled with songs of times primeval,<BR>
Filled with ancient wit and wisdom;<BR>
Sings the very oldest folk-songs,<BR>
Sings the origin of witchcraft,<BR>
Sings of Earth and its beginning<BR>
Sings the first of all creations,<BR>
Sings the source of good and evil<BR>
Sung alas! by youth no longer,<BR>
Only sung in part by heroes<BR>
In these days of sin and sorrow.<BR>
Evil days our land befallen.<BR>
Sings the orders of enchantment.<BR>
How, upon the will of Ukko,<BR>
By command of the Creator,<BR>
How the air was first divided,<BR>
How the water came from ether,<BR>
How the earth arose from water,<BR>
How from earth came vegetation,<BR>
Fish, and fowl, and man, and hero.</P>
<P>Sings again the wise Wipunen,<BR>
How the Moon was first created,<BR>
How the Sun was set in heaven,<BR>
Whence the colors of the rainbow,<BR>
Whence the ether's crystal pillars,<BR>
How the skies with stars were sprinkled.</P>
<P>Then again sings wise Wipunen,<BR>
Sings in miracles of concord,<BR>
Sings in magic tones of wisdom,<BR>
Never was there heard such singing;<BR>
Songs he sings in countless numbers,<BR>
Swift his notes as tongues of serpents,<BR>
All the distant hills re-echo;<BR>
Sings one day, and then a second,<BR>
Sings a third from dawn till evening,<BR>
Sings from evening till the morning;<BR>
Listen all the stars of heaven,<BR>
And the Moon stands still and listens<BR>
Fall the waves upon the deep-sea,<BR>
In the bay the tides cease rising,<BR>
Stop the rivers in their courses,<BR>
Stops the waterfall of Rutya,<BR>
Even Jordan ceases flowing,<BR>
And the Wuoksen stops and listens.</P>
<P>When the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Well had learned the magic sayings,<BR>
Learned the ancient songs and legends,<BR>
Learned the words of ancient wisdom,<BR>
Learned the lost-words of the Master,<BR>
Well had learned the secret doctrine,<BR>
He prepared to leave the body<BR>
Of the wisdom-bard, Wipunen,<BR>
Leave the bosom of the master,<BR>
Leave the wonderful enchanter.<BR>
Spake the hero, Wainamoinen:<BR>
"O, thou Antero Wipunen,<BR>
Open wide thy mouth and fauces,<BR>
I have found the magic lost-words,<BR>
I will leave thee now forever,<BR>
Leave thee and thy wondrous singing,<BR>
Will return to Kalevala,<BR>
To Wainola's fields and firesides."<BR>
Thus Wipunen spake in answer:<BR>
"Many are the things I've eaten,<BR>
Eaten bear, and elk, and reindeer,<BR>
Eaten ox, and wolf, and wild-boar,<BR>
Eaten man, and eaten hero,<BR>
Never, never have I eaten<BR>
Such a thing as Wainamoinen;<BR>
Thou hast found what thou desirest,<BR>
Found the three words of the Master;<BR>
Go in peace, and ne'er returning,<BR>
Take my blessing on thy going."</P>
<P>Thereupon the bard Wipunen<BR>
Opens wide his mouth, and wider;<BR>
And the good, old Wainamoinen<BR>
Straightway leaves the wise enchanter,<BR>
Leaves Wipunen's great abdomen;<BR>
From the mouth he glides and journeys<BR>
O'er the hills and vales of Northland,<BR>
Swift as red-deer or the forest,<BR>
Swift as yellow-breasted marten,<BR>
To the firesides of Wainola,<BR>
To the plains of Kalevala.</P>
<P>Straightway hastes he to the smithy<BR>
Of his brother, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Thus the iron-artist greets him:<BR>
Hast thou found the long-lost wisdom,<BR>
Hast thou heard the secret doctrine,<BR>
Hast thou learned the master magic,<BR>
How to fasten in the ledges,<BR>
How the stern should be completed,<BR>
How complete the ship's forecastle?<BR>
Wainamoinen thus made answer:<BR>
"I have learned of words a hundred,<BR>
Learned a thousand incantations,<BR>
Hidden deep for many ages,<BR>
Learned the words of ancient wisdom,<BR>
Found the keys of secret doctrine,<BR>
Found the lost-words of the Master."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, magic-builder,<BR>
Straightway journeys to his vessel,<BR>
To the spot of magic labor,<BR>
Quickly fastens in the ledges,<BR>
Firmly binds the stern together<BR>
And completes the boat's forecastle.<BR>
Thus the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Built the boat with magic only,<BR>
And with magic launched his vessel,<BR>
Using not the hand to touch it,<BR>
Using not the foot to move it,<BR>
Using not the knee to turn it,<BR>
Using nothing to propel it.<BR>
Thus the third task was completed,<BR>
For the hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Dowry for the Maid of Beauty<BR>
Sitting on the arch of heaven,<BR>
On the bow of many colors.</P>
