<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">DEATH OF LEMMINKAINEN.</H1>
<P>LEMMINKAINEN, much disheartened,<BR>
Deeply thought and long considered,<BR>
What to do, what course to follow,<BR>
Whether best to leave the wild-moose<BR>
In the fastnesses of Hisi,<BR>
And return to Kalevala,<BR>
Or a third time hunt the ranger,<BR>
Hoping thus to bring him captive,<BR>
Thus return at last a victor<BR>
To the forest home of Louhi,<BR>
To the joy of all her daughters,<BR>
To the wood-nymph's happy fireside.</P>
<P>Taking courage Lemminkainen<BR>
Spake these words in supplication:<BR>
"Ukko, thou O God above me,<BR>
Thou Creator of the heavens,<BR>
Put my snow-shoes well in order,<BR>
And endow them both with swiftness,<BR>
That I rapidly may journey<BR>
Over marshes, over snow-fields,<BR>
Over lowlands, over highlands,<BR>
Through the realms of wicked Hisi,<BR>
Through the distant plains of Lapland,<BR>
Through the paths of Lempo's wild-moose,<BR>
To the forest hills of Juutas.<BR>
To the snow-fields shall I journey,<BR>
Leave the heroes to the woodlands,<BR>
On the way to Tapiola,<BR>
Into Tapio's wild dwellings.</P>
<P>"Greeting bring I to the mountains,<BR>
Greeting to the vales and uplands,<BR>
Greet ye, heights with forests covered,<BR>
Greet ye, ever-verdant fir-trees,<BR>
Greet ye, groves of whitened aspen,<BR>
Greetings bring to those that greet you,<BR>
Fields, and streams, and woods of Lapland.<BR>
Bring me favor, mountain-woodlands,<BR>
Lapland-deserts, show me kindness,<BR>
Mighty Tapio, be gracious,<BR>
Let me wander through thy forests,<BR>
Let me glide along thy rivers,<BR>
Let this hunter search thy snow-fields,<BR>
Where the wild-moose herds in numbers<BR>
Where the bounding reindeer lingers.</P>
<P>"O Nyrikki, mountain hero,<BR>
Son of Tapio of forests,<BR>
Hero with the scarlet head-gear,<BR>
Notches make along the pathway,<BR>
Landmarks upward to the mountains,<BR>
That this hunter may not wander,<BR>
May not fall, and falling perish<BR>
In the snow-fields of thy kingdom,<BR>
Hunting for the moose of Hisi,<BR>
Dowry for the pride of Northland.</P>
<P>"Mistress of the woods, Mielikki,<BR>
Forest-mother, formed in beauty,<BR>
Let thy gold flow out abundant,<BR>
Let thy silver onward wander,<BR>
For the hero that is seeking<BR>
For the wild-moose of thy kingdom;<BR>
Bring me here thy keys of silver,<BR>
From the golden girdle round thee;<BR>
Open Tapio's rich chambers,<BR>
And unlock the forest fortress,<BR>
While I here await the booty,<BR>
While I hunt the moose of Lempo.</P>
<P>"Should this service be too menial<BR>
Give the order to thy servants,<BR>
Send at once thy servant-maidens,<BR>
And command it to thy people.<BR>
Thou wilt never seem a hostess,<BR>
If thou hast not in thy service,<BR>
Maidens ready by the hundreds,<BR>
Thousands that await thy bidding,<BR>
Who thy herds may watch and nurture,<BR>
Tend the game of thy dominions.</P>
<P>"Tall and slender forest-virgin,<BR>
Tapio's beloved daughter,<BR>
Blow thou now thy honey flute-notes,<BR>
Play upon thy forest-whistle,<BR>
For the hearing of thy mistress,<BR>
For thy charming woodland-mistress,<BR>
Make her hear thy sweet-toned playing,<BR>
That she may arise from slumber.<BR>
Should thy mistress not awaken<BR>
At the calling of thy flute-notes,<BR>
Play again, and play unceasing,<BR>
Make the golden tongue re-echo."</P>
<P>Wild and daring Lemminkainen<BR>
Steadfast prays upon his journey,<BR>
Calling on the gods for succor,<BR>
Hastens off through fields and moorlands,<BR>
Passes on through cruel brush-wood,<BR>
To the colliery of Hisi,<BR>
To the burning fields of Lempo;<BR>
Glided one day, then a second,<BR>
Glided all the next day onward,<BR>
Till he came to Big-stone mountain,<BR>
Climbed upon its rocky summit,<BR>
Turned his glances to the north-west,<BR>
Toward the Northland moors and marshes;<BR>
There appeared the Tapio-mansion.<BR>
All the doors were golden-colored,<BR>
Shining in the gleam of sunlight<BR>
Through the thickets on the mountains,<BR>
Through the distant fields of Northland.</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, much encouraged,<BR>
Hastens onward from his station<BR>
Through the lowlands, o'er the uplands,<BR>
Over snow-fields vast and vacant,<BR>
Under snow-robed firs and aspens,<BR>
Hastens forward, happy-hearted,<BR>
Quickly reaches Tapio's court-yards,<BR>
Halts without at Tapio's windows,<BR>
Slyly looks into her mansion,<BR>
Spies within some kindly women,<BR>
Forest-dames outstretched before him,<BR>
All are clad in scanty raiment,<BR>
Dressed in soiled and ragged linens.<BR>
Spake the stranger Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Wherefore sit ye, forest-mothers,<BR>
In your old and simple garments,<BR>
In your soiled and ragged linen?<BR>
Ye, forsooth! are too untidy,<BR>
Too unsightly your appearance<BR>
In your tattered gowns appareled.<BR>
When I lived within the forest,<BR>
There were then three mountain castles,<BR>
One of horn and one of ivory,<BR>
And the third of wood constructed;<BR>
In their walls were golden windows,<BR>
Six the windows in each castle,<BR>
Through these windows I discovered<BR>
All the host of Tapio's mansion,<BR>
Saw its fair and stately hostess;<BR>
Saw great Tapio's lovely daughter,<BR>
Saw Tellervo in her beauty,<BR>
With her train of charming maidens;<BR>
All were dressed in golden raiment,<BR>
Rustled all in gold and silver.<BR>
Then the forest's queenly hostess,<BR>
Still the hostess of these woodlands,<BR>
On her arms wore golden bracelets,<BR>
Golden rings upon her fingers,<BR>
In her hair were sparkling, jewels,<BR>
On her bead were golden fillets,<BR>
In her ears were golden ear-rings,<BR>
On her neck a pearly necklace,<BR>
And her braidlets, silver-tinselled.</P>
<P>"Lovely hostess of the forest,<BR>
Metsola's enchanting mistress,<BR>
Fling aside thine ugly straw-shoes,<BR>
Cast away the shoes of birch-bark,<BR>
Doff thy soiled and ragged linen,<BR>
Doff thy gown of shabby fabric,<BR>
Don the bright and festive raiment,<BR>
Don the gown of merry-making,<BR>
While I stay within thy borders,<BR>
While I seek my forest-booty,<BR>
Hunt the moose of evil Hisi.<BR>
Here my visit will be irksome,<BR>
Here thy guest will be ill-humored,<BR>
Waiting in thy fields and woodlands,<BR>
Hunting here the moose of Lempo,<BR>
Finding not the Hisi-ranger,<BR>
Shouldst thou give me no enjoyment,<BR>
Should I find no joy, nor respite.<BR>
Long the eve that gives no pleasure,<BR>
Long the day that brings no guerdon!</P>
<P>"Sable-bearded god of forests,<BR>
In thy hat and coat of ermine,<BR>
Robe thy trees in finest fibers,<BR>
Deck thy groves in richest fabrics,<BR>
Give the fir-trees shining silver,<BR>
Deck with gold the slender balsams,<BR>
Give the spruces copper belting,<BR>
And the pine-trees silver girdles,<BR>
Give the birches golden flowers,<BR>
Deck their stems with silver fret-work,<BR>
This their garb in former ages,<BR>
When the days and nights were brighter,<BR>
When the fir-trees shone like sunlight,<BR>
And the birches like the moonbeams;<BR>
Honey breathed throughout the forest,<BR>
Settled in the glens and highlands<BR>
Spices in the meadow-borders,<BR>
Oil out-pouring from the lowlands.</P>
<P>"Forest daughter, lovely virgin,<BR>
Golden maiden, fair Tulikki,<BR>
Second of the Tapio-daughters,<BR>
Drive the game within these borders,<BR>
To these far-extending snow-fields.<BR>
Should the reindeer be too sluggish,<BR>
Should the moose-deer move too slowly<BR>
Cut a birch-rod from the thicket,<BR>
Whip them hither in their beauty,<BR>
Drive the wild-moose to my hurdle,<BR>
Hither drive the long-sought booty<BR>
To the hunter who is watching,<BR>
Waiting in the Hisi-forests.</P>
<P>"When the game has started hither,<BR>
Keep them in the proper highway,<BR>
Hold thy magic hands before them,<BR>
Guard them well on either road-side,<BR>
That the elk may not escape thee,<BR>
May not dart adown some by-path.<BR>
Should, perchance, the moose-deer wander<BR>
Through some by-way of the forest,<BR>
Take him by the ears and antlers,<BR>
Hither lead the pride of Lempo.</P>
<P>"If the path be filled with brush-wood<BR>
Cast the brush-wood to the road-side;<BR>
If the branches cross his pathway,<BR>
Break the branches into fragments;<BR>
Should a fence of fir or alder<BR>
Cross the way that leads him hither.<BR>
Make an opening within it,<BR>
Open nine obstructing fences;<BR>
If the way be crossed by streamlets,<BR>
If the path be stopped by rivers,<BR>
Make a bridge of silken fabric,<BR>
Weaving webs of scarlet color,<BR>
Drive the deer-herd gently over,<BR>
Lead them gently o'er the waters,<BR>
O'er the rivers of thy forests,<BR>
O'er the streams of thy dominions.</P>
<P>"Thou, the host of Tapio's mansion,<BR>
Gracious host of Tapiola,<BR>
Sable-bearded god of woodlands,<BR>
Golden lord of Northland forests,<BR>
Thou, O Tapio's worthy hostess,<BR>
Queen of snowy woods, Mimerkki,<BR>
Ancient dame in sky-blue vesture,<BR>
Fenland-queen in scarlet ribbons,<BR>
Come I to exchange my silver,<BR>
To exchange my gold and silver;<BR>
Gold I have, as old as moonlight,<BR>
Silver of the age of sunshine,<BR>
In the first of years was gathered,<BR>
In the heat and pain of battle;<BR>
It will rust within my pouches,<BR>
Soon will wear away and perish,<BR>
If it be not used in trading."</P>
<P>Long the hunter, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Glided through the fen and forest,<BR>
Sang his songs throughout the woodlands,<BR>
Through three mountain glens be sang them,<BR>
Sang the forest hostess friendly,<BR>
Sang he, also, Tapio friendly,<BR>
Friendly, all the forest virgins,<BR>
All of Metsola's fair daughters.</P>
<P>Now they start the herds of Lempo,<BR>
Start the wild-moose from his shelter,<BR>
In the realms of evil Hisi,<BR>
Tapio's highest mountain-region;<BR>
Now they drive the ranger homeward,<BR>
To the open courts of Piru,<BR>
To the hero that is waiting,<BR>
Hunting for the moose of Juutas.</P>
<P>When the herd had reached the castle,<BR>
Lemminkainen threw his lasso<BR>
O'er the antlers of the blue-moose,<BR>
Settled on the neck and shoulders<BR>
Of the mighty moose of Hisi.<BR>
Then the hunter, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Stroked his captive's neck in safety,<BR>
For the moose was well-imprisoned.</P>
<P>Thereupon gay Lemminkainen<BR>
Filled with joyance spake as follows:<BR>
"Pride of forests, queen of woodlands,<BR>
Metsola's enchanted hostess,<BR>
Lovely forest dame, Mielikki,<BR>
Mother-donor of the mountains,<BR>
Take the gold that I have promised,<BR>
Come and take away the silver;<BR>
Spread thy kerchief well before me,<BR>
Spread out here thy silken neck-wrap,<BR>
Underneath the golden treasure,<BR>
Underneath the shining silver,<BR>
that to earth it may not settle,<BR>
Scattered on the snows of winter."</P>
<P>Then the hero went a victor<BR>
To the dwellings of Pohyola,<BR>
And addressed these words to Louhi:<BR>
"I have caught the moose of Hisi,<BR>
In the Metsola-dominions,<BR>
Give, O hostess, give thy daughter,<BR>
Give to me thy fairest virgin,<BR>
Bride of mine to be hereafter."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Gave this answer to the suitor:<BR>
"I will give to thee my daughter,<BR>
For thy wife my fairest maiden,<BR>
When for me thou'lt put a bridle<BR>
On the flaming horse of Hisi,<BR>
Rapid messenger of Lempo,<BR>
On the Hisi-plains and pastures."</P>
<P>Nothing daunted, Lemminkainen<BR>
Hastened forward to accomplish<BR>
Louhi's second test of heroes,<BR>
On the cultivated lowlands,<BR>
On the sacred fields and forests.<BR>
Everywhere he sought the racer,<BR>
Sought the fire-expiring stallion,<BR>
Fire out-shooting from his nostrils.<BR>
Lemminkainen, fearless hunter,<BR>
Bearing in his belt his bridle,<BR>
On his shoulders, reins and halter,<BR>
Sought one day, and then a second,<BR>
Finally, upon the third day,<BR>
Went he to the Hisi-mountain,<BR>
Climbed, and struggled to the summit;<BR>
To the east he turned his glances,<BR>
Cast his eyes upon the sunrise,<BR>
There beheld the flaming courser,<BR>
On the heath among the far-trees.<BR>
Lempo's fire-expiring stallion<BR>
Fire and mingled smoke, out-shooting<BR>
From his mouth, and eyes, and nostrils.</P>
<P>Spake the daring Lemminkainen,<BR>
This the hero's supplication:<BR>
"Ukko, thou O God above me,<BR>
Thou that rulest all the storm-clouds,<BR>
Open thou the vault of heaven,<BR>
Open windows through the ether,<BR>
Let the icy rain come falling,<BR>
Lot the heavy hailstones shower<BR>
On the flaming horse of Hisi,<BR>
On the fire-expiring stallion."</P>
<P>Ukko, the benign Creator,<BR>
Heard the prayer of Lemminkainen,<BR>
Broke apart the dome of heaven,<BR>
Rent the heights of heaven asunder,<BR>
Sent the iron-hail in showers,<BR>
Smaller than the heads of horses,<BR>
Larger than the heads of heroes,<BR>
On the flaming steed of Lempo,<BR>
On the fire-expiring stallion,<BR>
On the terror of the Northland.</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, drawing nearer,<BR>
Looked with care upon the courser,<BR>
Then he spake the words that follow:<BR>
"Wonder-steed of mighty Hisi,<BR>
Flaming horse of Lempo's mountain,<BR>
Bring thy mouth of gold, assenting,<BR>
Gently place thy head of silver<BR>
In this bright and golden halter,<BR>
In this silver-mounted bridle.<BR>
I shall never harshly treat thee,<BR>
Never make thee fly too fleetly,<BR>
On the way to Sariola,<BR>
On the tracks of long duration,<BR>
To the hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
To her magic courts and stables,<BR>
Will not lash thee on thy journey;<BR>
I shall lead thee gently forward,<BR>
Drive thee with the reins of kindness,<BR>
Cover thee with silken blankets."</P>
<P>Then the fire-haired steed of Juutas,<BR>
Flaming horse of mighty Hisi,<BR>
Put his bead of shining silver,<BR>
In the bright and golden bead-stall,<BR>
In the silver-mounted bridle.<BR>
Thus the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Easy bridles Lempo's stallion,<BR>
Flaming horse of evil Piru;<BR>
Lays the bits within his fire-mouth,<BR>
On his silver head, the halter,<BR>
Mounts the fire-expiring courser,<BR>
Brandishes his whip of willow,<BR>
Hastens forward on his journey,<BR>
Bounding o'er the hills and mountains,<BR>
Dashing through the valleys northward,<BR>
O'er the snow-capped hills of Lapland,<BR>
To the courts of Sariola.</P>
<P>Then the hero, quick dismounting,<BR>
Stepped within the court of Louhi,<BR>
Thus addressed the Northland hostess:<BR>
"I have bridled Lempo's fire-horse,<BR>
I have caught the Hisi-racer,<BR>
Caught the fire-expiring stallion,<BR>
In the Piru plains and pastures,<BR>
Ridden him within thy borders;<BR>
I have caught the moose of Lempo,<BR>
I have done what thou demandest;<BR>
Give, I pray thee, now thy daughter,<BR>
Give to me thy fairest maiden,<BR>
Bride of mine to be forever."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Made this answer to the suitor:<BR>
"I will only give my daughter,<BR>
Give to thee my fairest virgin,<BR>
Bride of thine to be forever,<BR>
When for me the swan thou killest<BR>
In the river of Tuoni,<BR>
Swimming in the black death-river,<BR>
In the sacred stream and whirlpool;<BR>
Thou canst try one cross-bow only,<BR>
But one arrow from thy quiver."</P>
<P>Then the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Braved the third test of the hero,<BR>
Started out to hunt the wild-swan,<BR>
Hunt the long-necked, graceful swimmer,<BR>
In Tuoni's coal-black river,<BR>
In Manala's lower regions.<BR>
Quick the daring hunter journeyed,<BR>
Hastened off with fearless footsteps,<BR>
To the river of Tuoni,<BR>
To the sacred stream and whirlpool,<BR>
With his bow upon his shoulder,<BR>
With his quiver and one arrow.</P>
<P>Nasshut, blind and crippled shepherd,<BR>
Wretched shepherd of Pohyola,<BR>
Stood beside the death-land river,<BR>
Near the sacred stream and whirlpool,<BR>
Guarding Tuonela's waters,<BR>
Waiting there for Lemminkainen,<BR>
Listening there for Kaukomieli,<BR>
Waiting long the hero's coming.<BR>
Finally he hears the footsteps<BR>
Of the hero on his journey,<BR>
Hears the tread of Lemminkainen,<BR>
As he journeys nearer, nearer,<BR>
To the river of Tuoni,<BR>
To the cataract of death-land,<BR>
To the sacred stream and whirlpool.<BR>
Quick the wretched shepherd, Nasshut,<BR>
From the death-stream sends a serpent,<BR>
Like an arrow from a cross-bow,<BR>
To the heart of Lemminkainen,<BR>
Through the vitals of the hero.</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, little conscious,<BR>
Hardly knew that be was injured,<BR>
Spake these measures as he perished.<BR>
"Ah! unworthy is my conduct,<BR>
Ah! unwisely have I acted,<BR>
That I did not heed my mother,<BR>
Did not take her goodly counsel,<BR>
Did not learn her words of magic.<BR>
Oh I for three words with my mother,<BR>
How to live, and bow to suffer,<BR>
In this time of dire misfortune,<BR>
How to bear the stings of serpents,<BR>
Tortures of the reed of waters,<BR>
From the stream of Tuonela!</P>
<P>"Ancient mother who hast borne me,<BR>
Who hast trained me from my childhood,<BR>
Learn, I pray thee, where I linger,<BR>
Where alas! thy son is lying,<BR>
Where thy reckless hero suffers.<BR>
Come, I pray thee, faithful mother,<BR>
Come thou quickly, thou art needed,<BR>
Come deliver me from torture,<BR>
From the death-jaws of Tuoni,<BR>
From the sacred stream and whirlpool."</P>
<P>Northland's old and wretched shepherd,<BR>
Nasshut, the despised protector<BR>
Of the flocks of Sariola,<BR>
Throws the dying Lemminkainen,<BR>
Throws the hero of the islands,<BR>
Into Tuonela's river,<BR>
To the blackest stream of death-land,<BR>
To the worst of fatal whirlpools.<BR>
Lemminkainen, wild and daring,<BR>
Helpless falls upon the waters,<BR>
Floating down the coal-black current,<BR>
Through the cataract and rapids<BR>
To the tombs of Tuonela.</P>
<P>There the blood-stained son of death-land,<BR>
There Tuoni's son and hero,<BR>
Cuts in pieces Lemminkainen,<BR>
Chops him with his mighty hatchet,<BR>
Till the sharpened axe strikes flint-sparks<BR>
From the rocks within his chamber,<BR>
Chops the hero into fragments,<BR>
Into five unequal portions,<BR>
Throws each portion to Tuoni,<BR>
In Manala's lowest kingdom,<BR>
Speaks these words when he has ended:<BR>
"Swim thou there, wild Lemminkainen,<BR>
Flow thou onward in this river,<BR>
Hunt forever in these waters,<BR>
With thy cross-bow and thine arrow,<BR>
Shoot the swan within this empire,<BR>
Shoot our water-birds in welcome!"<BR>
Thus the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Thus the handsome Kaukomieli,<BR>
The untiring suitor, dieth<BR>
In the river of Tuoni,<BR>
In the death-realm of Manala.</P>
