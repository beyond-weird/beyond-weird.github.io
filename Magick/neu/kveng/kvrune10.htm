<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">ILMARINEN FORGES THE SAMPO.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, the magician,<BR>
Takes his steed of copper color,<BR>
Hitches quick his fleet-foot courser,<BR>
Puts his racer to the snow-sledge,<BR>
Straightway springs upon the cross-seat,<BR>
Snaps his whip adorned with jewels.<BR>
Like the winds the steed flies onward,<BR>
Like a lightning flash, the racer<BR>
Makes the snow-sledge creak and rattle,<BR>
Makes the highway quickly vanish,<BR>
Dashes on through fen and forest,<BR>
Over hills and through the valleys,<BR>
Over marshes, over mountains,<BR>
Over fertile plains and meadows;<BR>
Journeys one day, then a second,<BR>
So a third from morn till evening,<BR>
Till the third day evening brings him<BR>
To the endless bridge of Osmo,<BR>
To the Osmo-fields and pastures,<BR>
To the plains of Kalevala;<BR>
When the hero spake as follows:<BR>
"May the wolves devour the dreamer,<BR>
Eat the Laplander for dinner,<BR>
May disease destroy the braggart,<BR>
Him who said that I should never<BR>
See again my much-loved home-land,<BR>
Nevermore behold my kindred,<BR>
Never during all my life-time,<BR>
Never while the sunshine brightens,<BR>
Never while the moonlight glimmers<BR>
On the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
On the plains of Kalevala."</P>
<P>Then began old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Ancient bard and famous singer,<BR>
To renew his incantations;<BR>
Sang aloft a wondrous pine-tree,<BR>
Till it pierced the clouds in growing<BR>
With its golden top and branches,<BR>
Till it touched the very heavens,<BR>
Spread its branches in the ether,<BR>
In the ever-shining sunlight.</P>
<P>Now he sings again enchanting,<BR>
Sings the Moon to shine forever<BR>
In the fir-tree's emerald branches;<BR>
In its top he sings the Great Bear.<BR>
Then be quickly journeys homeward,<BR>
Hastens to his golden portals,<BR>
Head awry and visage wrinkled,<BR>
Crooked cap upon his forehead,<BR>
Since as ransom he had promised<BR>
Ilmarinen, magic artist,<BR>
Thus to save his life from torture<BR>
On the distant fields of Northland<BR>
In the dismal Sariola.</P>
<P>When his stallion he had halted<BR>
On the Osmo-field and meadow,<BR>
Quickly rising in his snow-sledge,<BR>
The magician heard one knocking,<BR>
Breaking coal within the smithy,<BR>
Beating with a heavy hammer.<BR>
Wainamoinen, famous minstrel,<BR>
Entering the smithy straightway,<BR>
Found the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Knocking with his copper hammer.<BR>
Ilmarinen spake as follows:<BR>
"Welcome, brother Wainamoinen,<BR>
Old and worthy Wainamoinen!<BR>
Why so long hast thou been absent,<BR>
Where hast thou so long been hiding?"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen then made answer,<BR>
These the words of the magician:<BR>
"Long indeed have I been living,<BR>
Many dreary days have wandered,<BR>
Many cheerless nights have lingered,<BR>
Floating on the cruel ocean,<BR>
Weeping in the fens and woodlands<BR>
Of the never-pleasant Northland,<BR>
In the dismal Sariola;<BR>
With the Laplanders I've wandered,<BR>
With the people filled with witchcraft."</P>
<P>Promptly answers Ilmarinen,<BR>
These the words the blacksmith uses:<BR>
"O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Famous and eternal singer,<BR>
Tell me of thy journey northward,<BR>
Of thy wanderings in Lapland,<BR>
Of thy dismal journey homeward."<BR>
Spake the minstrel, Wainamoinen:<BR>
"I have much to tell thee, brother,<BR>
Listen to my wondrous story:<BR>
In the Northland lives a virgin,<BR>
In a village there, a maiden,<BR>
That will not accept a lover,<BR>
That a hero's hand refuses,<BR>
That a wizard's heart disdaineth;<BR>
All of Northland sings her praises,<BR>
Sings her worth and magic beauty,<BR>
Fairest maiden of Pohyola,<BR>
Daughter of the earth and ocean.<BR>
From her temples beams the moonlight,<BR>
From her breast, the gleam of sunshine,<BR>
From her forehead shines the rainbow,<BR>
On her neck, the seven starlets,<BR>
And the Great Bear from her shoulder.</P>
<P>"Ilmarinen, worthy brother,<BR>
Thou the only skilful blacksmith,<BR>
Go and see her wondrous beauty,<BR>
See her gold and silver garments,<BR>
See her robed in finest raiment,<BR>
See her sitting on the rainbow,<BR>
Walking on the clouds of purple.<BR>
Forge for her the magic Sampo,<BR>
Forge the lid in many colors,<BR>
Thy reward shall be the virgin,<BR>
Thou shalt win this bride of beauty;<BR>
Go and bring the lovely maiden<BR>
To thy home in Kalevala."<BR>
Spake the brother, Ilmarinen:<BR>
O thou cunning Wainamoinen,<BR>
Thou hast promised me already<BR>
To the ever-darksome Northland,<BR>
Thy devoted head to ransom,<BR>
Thus to rescue thee from trouble.<BR>
I shall never visit Northland,<BR>
Shall not go to see thy maiden,<BR>
Do not love the Bride of Beauty;<BR>
Never while the moonlight glimmers,<BR>
Shall I go to dreary Pohya,<BR>
To the plains of Sariola,<BR>
Where the people eat each other,<BR>
Sink their heroes in the ocean,<BR>
Not for all the maids of Lapland."<BR>
Spake the brother, Wainamoinen:<BR>
"I can tell thee greater wonders,<BR>
Listen to my wondrous story:<BR>
I have seen the fir-tree blossom,<BR>
Seen its flowers with emerald branches,<BR>
On the Osmo-fields and woodlands;<BR>
In its top, there shines the moonlight,<BR>
And the Bear lives in its branches."<BR>
Ilmarinen thus made answer:<BR>
"I cannot believe thy story,<BR>
Cannot trust thy tale of wonder,<BR>
Till I see the blooming fir-tree,<BR>
With its many emerald branches,<BR>
With its Bear and golden moonlight."<BR>
This is Wainamoinen's answer:<BR>
"Wilt thou not believe my story?<BR>
Come with me and I will show thee<BR>
If my lips speak fact or fiction."<BR>
Quick they journey to discover,<BR>
Haste to view the wondrous fir-tree;<BR>
Wainamoinen leads the journey,<BR>
Ilmarinen closely follows.<BR>
As they near the Osmo-borders,<BR>
Ilmarinen hastens forward<BR>
That be may behold the wonder,<BR>
Spies the Bear Within the fir-top,<BR>
Sitting on its emerald branches,<BR>
Spies the gleam of golden moonlight.<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen,</P>
<P>These the words the singer uttered:<BR>
Climb this tree, dear Ilmarinen,<BR>
And bring down the golden moonbeams,<BR>
Bring the Moon and Bear down with thee<BR>
From the fir-tree's lofty branches."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, full consenting,<BR>
Straightway climbed the golden fir-tree,<BR>
High upon the bow of heaven,<BR>
Thence to bring the golden moonbeams,<BR>
Thence to bring the Bear of heaven,<BR>
From the fir-tree's topmost branches.</P>
<P>Thereupon the blooming fir-tree<BR>
Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<BR>
"O thou senseless, thoughtless hero,<BR>
Thou hast neither wit nor instinct;<BR>
Thou dost climb my golden branches,<BR>
Like a thing of little judgment,<BR>
Thus to get my pictured moonbeams,<BR>
Take away my silver starlight,<BR>
Steal my Bear and blooming branches."</P>
<P>Quick as thought old Wainamoinen<BR>
Sang again in magic accents,<BR>
Sang a storm-wind in the heavens,<BR>
Sang the wild winds into fury,<BR>
And the singer spake as follows:<BR>
`Take, O storm-wind, take the forgeman,<BR>
Carry him within thy vessel,<BR>
Quickly hence, and land the hero<BR>
On the ever-darksome Northland,<BR>
On the dismal Sariola."</P>
<P>Now the storm-wind quickly darkens,<BR>
Quickly piles the air together,<BR>
Makes of air a sailing vessel,<BR>
Takes the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Fleetly from the fir-tree branches,<BR>
Toward the never-pleasant Northland,<BR>
Toward the dismal Sariola.<BR>
Through the air sailed Ilmarinen,<BR>
Fast and far the hero travelled,<BR>
Sweeping onward, sailing northward,<BR>
Riding in the track of storm-winds,<BR>
O'er the Moon, beneath the sunshine,<BR>
On the broad back of the Great Bear,<BR>
Till he neared Pohyola's woodlands,<BR>
Neared the homes of Sariola,<BR>
And alighted undiscovered,<BR>
Was Dot noticed by the hunters,<BR>
Was not scented by the watch-dogs.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Ancient, toothless dame of Northland,<BR>
Standing in the open court-yard,<BR>
Thus addresses Ilmarinen,<BR>
As she spies the hero-stranger:<BR>
"Who art thou of ancient heroes,<BR>
Who of all the host of heroes,<BR>
Coming here upon the storm-wind,<BR>
O'er the sledge-path of the ether,<BR>
Scented not by Pohya's watch-dogs?<BR>
This is Ilmarinen's answer:<BR>
"I have surely not come hither<BR>
To be barked at by the watch-dogs,<BR>
At these unfamiliar portals,<BR>
At the gates of Sariola."</P>
<P>Thereupon the Northland hostess<BR>
Asks again the hero-stranger:<BR>
"Hast thou ever been acquainted<BR>
With the blacksmith of Wainola,<BR>
With the hero, Ilmarinen,<BR>
With the skilful smith and artist?<BR>
Long I've waited for his coming,<BR>
Long this one has been expected,<BR>
On the borders of the Northland,<BR>
Here to forge for me the Sampo."<BR>
Spake the hero, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Well indeed am I acquainted<BR>
With the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
I myself am Ilmarinen,<BR>
I, the skilful smith and artist."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Toothless dame of Sariola,<BR>
Straightway rushes to her dwelling,<BR>
These the words that Louhi utters:<BR>
"Come, thou youngest of my daughters,<BR>
Come, thou fairest of my maidens,<BR>
Dress thyself in finest raiment,<BR>
Deck thy hair with rarest jewels,<BR>
Pearls upon thy swelling bosom,<BR>
On thy neck, a golden necklace,<BR>
Bind thy head with silken ribbons,<BR>
Make thy cheeks look fresh and ruddy,<BR>
And thy visage fair and winsome,<BR>
Since the artist, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Hither comes from Kalevala,<BR>
Here to forge for us the Sampo,<BR>
Hammer us the lid in colors."</P>
<P>Now the daughter of the Northland,<BR>
Honored by the land and water,<BR>
Straightway takes her choicest raiment,<BR>
Takes her dresses rich in beauty,<BR>
Finest of her silken wardrobe,<BR>
Now adjusts her silken fillet,<BR>
On her brow a band of copper,<BR>
Round her waist a golden girdle,<BR>
Round her neck a pearly necklace,<BR>
Shining gold upon her bosom,<BR>
In her hair the threads of silver.<BR>
From her dressing-room she hastens,<BR>
To the hall she bastes and listens,<BR>
Full of beauty, full of joyance,<BR>
Ears erect and eyes bright-beaming,<BR>
Ruddy cheeks and charming visage,<BR>
Waiting for the hero-stranger.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Leads the hero, Ilmarinen,<BR>
To her dwelling-rooms in Northland,<BR>
To her home in Sariola,<BR>
Seats him at her well-filled table,<BR>
Gives to him the finest viands,<BR>
Gives him every needed comfort,<BR>
Then addresses him as follows:<BR>
"O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Master of the forge and smithy,<BR>
Canst thou forge for me the Sampo,<BR>
Hammer me the lid in colors,<BR>
From the tips of white-swan feathers,<BR>
From the milk of greatest virtue,<BR>
From a single grain of barley,<BR>
From the finest wool of lambkins?<BR>
Thou shalt have my fairest daughter,<BR>
Recompense for this thy service."<BR>
These the words of Ilmarinen:<BR>
"I will forge for thee the Sampo,<BR>
Hammer thee the lid in colors,<BR>
From the tips of white-swan feathers,<BR>
From the milk of greatest virtue,<BR>
From a single grain of barley,<BR>
From the finest wool of lambkins?<BR>
Since I forged the arch of heaven,<BR>
Forged the air a concave cover,<BR>
Ere the earth had a beginning."</P>
<P>Thereupon the magic blacksmith<BR>
Went to forge the wondrous Sampo,<BR>
Went to find a blacksmith's workshop,<BR>
Went to find the tools to work with;<BR>
But he found no place for forging,<BR>
Found no smithy, found no bellows,<BR>
Found no chimney, found no anvil,<BR>
Found no tongs, and found no hammer.</P>
<P>Then the-artist, Ilmarinen.<BR>
Spake these words, soliloquizing:<BR>
"Only women grow discouraged,<BR>
Only knaves leave work unfinished,<BR>
Not the devils, nor the heroes,<BR>
Nor the Gods of greater knowledge."</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Sought a place to build a smithy,<BR>
Sought a place to plant a bellows,<BR>
On the borders of the Northland,<BR>
On the Pohya-hills and meadows;<BR>
Searched one day, and then a second;<BR>
Ere the evening of the third day,<BR>
Came a rock within his vision,<BR>
Came a stone with rainbow-colors.<BR>
There the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Set at work to build his smithy,<BR>
Built a fire and raised a chimney;<BR>
On the next day laid his bellows,<BR>
On the third day built his furnace,<BR>
And began to forge the Sampo.</P>
<P>The eternal magic artist,<BR>
Ancient blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
First of all the iron-workers,<BR>
Mixed together certain metals,<BR>
Put the mixture in the caldron,<BR>
Laid it deep within the furnace,<BR>
Called the hirelings to the forging.<BR>
Skilfully they work the bellows,<BR>
Tend the fire and add the fuel,<BR>
Three most lovely days of summer,<BR>
Three short nights of bright midsummer,<BR>
Till the rocks begin to blossom,<BR>
In the foot-prints of the workmen,<BR>
From the magic heat and furnace.</P>
<P>On the first day, Ilmarinen<BR>
Downward bent and well examined,<BR>
On the bottom of his furnace,<BR>
Thus to see what might be forming<BR>
From the magic fire and metals.<BR>
From the fire arose a cross-bow,<BR>
"With the brightness of the moonbeams,<BR>
Golden bow with tips of silver;<BR>
On the shaft was shining copper,<BR>
And the bow was strong and wondrous,<BR>
But alas! it was ill-natured,<BR>
Asking for a hero daily,<BR>
Two the heads it asked on feast-days.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, skilful artist,<BR>
Was not pleased with this creation,<BR>
Broke the bow in many pieces,<BR>
Threw them back within the furnace,<BR>
Kept the workmen at the bellows,<BR>
Tried to forge the magic Sampo.</P>
<P>On the second day, the blacksmith<BR>
Downward bent and well examined,<BR>
On the bottom of the furnace;<BR>
From the fire, a skiff of metals,<BR>
Came a boat of purple color,<BR>
All the ribs were colored golden,<BR>
And the oars were forged from copper;<BR>
Thus the skiff was full of beauty,<BR>
But alas! a thing of evil;<BR>
Forth it rushes into trouble,<BR>
Hastens into every quarrel,<BR>
Hastes without a provocation<BR>
Into every evil combat.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, metal artist,<BR>
Is not pleased with this creation,<BR>
Breaks the skiff in many fragments,<BR>
Throws them back within the furnace,<BR>
Keeps the workmen at the bellows,<BR>
Thus to forge the magic Sampo.</P>
<P>On the third day, Ilmarinen,<BR>
First of all the metal-workers,<BR>
Downward bent and well examined,<BR>
On the bottom of the furnace;<BR>
There be saw a heifer rising,<BR>
Golden were the horns of Kimmo,<BR>
On her head the Bear of heaven,<BR>
On her brow a disc of sunshine,<BR>
Beautiful the cow of magic;<BR>
But alas! she is ill-tempered,<BR>
Rushes headlong through the forest,<BR>
Rushes through the swamps and meadows,<BR>
Wasting all her milk in running.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, the magician.<BR>
Is not pleased with this creation,<BR>
Cuts the magic cow in pieces,<BR>
Throws them in the fiery furnace,<BR>
Sets the workmen at the bellows,<BR>
Thus to forge the magic Sampo.</P>
<P>On the fourth day, Ilmarinen<BR>
Downward bent and well examined,<BR>
To the bottom of the furnace;<BR>
There beheld a plow in beauty<BR>
Rising from the fire of metals,<BR>
Golden was the point and plowshare,<BR>
And the beam was forged from copper,<BR>
And the handles, molten silver,<BR>
Beautiful the plow and wondrous;<BR>
But alas! it is ill-mannered,<BR>
Plows up fields of corn and barley,<BR>
Furrows through the richest meadows.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, metal artist,<BR>
Is not pleased with this creation,<BR>
Quickly breaks the plow in pieces,<BR>
Throws them back within the furnace,<BR>
Lets the winds attend the bellows,<BR>
Lets the storm-winds fire the metals.<BR>
Fiercely vie the winds of heaven,<BR>
East-wind rushing, West-wind roaring,<BR>
South-wind crying, North-wind howling,<BR>
Blow one day and then a second,<BR>
Blow the third from morn till even,<BR>
When the fire leaps through the windows,<BR>
Through the door the sparks fly upward,<BR>
Clouds of smoke arise to heaven;<BR>
With the clouds the black smoke mingles,<BR>
As the storm-winds ply the bellows.</P>
<P>On the third night Ilmarinen,<BR>
Bending low to view his metals,<BR>
On the bottom of the furnace,<BR>
Sees the magic Sampo rising,<BR>
Sees the lid in many colors.<BR>
Quick the artist of Wainola<BR>
Forges with the tongs and anvil,<BR>
Knocking with a heavy hammer,<BR>
Forges skilfully the Sampo;<BR>
On one side the flour is grinding,<BR>
On another salt is making,<BR>
On a third is money forging,<BR>
And the lid is many-colored.<BR>
Well the Sampo grinds when finished,<BR>
To and fro the lid in rocking,<BR>
Grinds one measure at the day-break,<BR>
Grinds a measure fit for eating,<BR>
Grinds a second for the market,<BR>
Grinds a third one for the store-house.</P>
<P>Joyfully the dame of Northland,<BR>
Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Takes away the magic Sampo,<BR>
To the hills of Sariola,<BR>
To the copper-bearing mountains,<BR>
Puts nine locks upon the wonder,<BR>
Makes three strong roots creep around it;<BR>
In the earth they grow nine fathoms,<BR>
One large root beneath the mountain,<BR>
One beneath the sandy sea-bed,<BR>
One beneath the mountain-dwelling.</P>
<P>Modestly pleads Ilmarinen<BR>
For the maiden's willing answer,<BR>
These the words of the magician:<BR>
"Wilt thou come with me, fair maiden,<BR>
Be my wife and queen forever?<BR>
I have forged for thee the Sampo,<BR>
Forged the lid in many colors."</P>
<P>Northland's fair and lovely daughter<BR>
Answers thus the metal-worker:<BR>
"Who will in the coming spring-time,<BR>
Who will in the second summer,<BR>
Guide the cuckoo's song and echo?<BR>
Who will listen to his calling,<BR>
Who will sing with him in autumn,<BR>
Should I go to distant regions,<BR>
Should this cheery maiden vanish<BR>
From the fields of Sariola,<BR>
From Pohyola's fens and forests,<BR>
Where the cuckoo sings and echoes?<BR>
Should I leave my father's dwelling,<BR>
Should my mother's berry vanish,<BR>
Should these mountains lose their cherry,<BR>
Then the cuckoo too would vanish,<BR>
All the birds would leave the forest,<BR>
Leave the summit of the mountain,<BR>
Leave my native fields and woodlands,<BR>
Never shall I, in my life-time,<BR>
Say farewell to maiden freedom,<BR>
Nor to summer cares and labors,<BR>
Lest the harvest be ungarnered,<BR>
Lest the berries be ungathered,<BR>
Lest the song-birds leave the forest,<BR>
Lest the mermaids leave the waters,<BR>
Lest I sing with them no longer."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, the magician,<BR>
The eternal metal-forger,<BR>
Cap awry and head dejected,<BR>
Disappointed, heavy-hearted,<BR>
Empty-handed, well considers,<BR>
How to reach his distant country,<BR>
Reach his much-loved home and kinded,<BR>
Gain the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
From the never-pleasant Northland,<BR>
From the darksome Sariola.<BR>
Louhi thus addressed the suitor:<BR>
"O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Why art thou so heavy-hearted,<BR>
Why thy visage so dejected?<BR>
Hast thou in thy mind to journey<BR>
From the vales and hills of Pohya,<BR>
To the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
To thy home in Kalevala?<BR>
This is Ilmarinen's answer:<BR>
"Thitherward my mind is tending,<BR>
To my home-land let me journey,<BR>
With my kindred let me linger,<BR>
Be at rest in mine own country."</P>
<P>Straightway Louhi, dame of Northland,<BR>
Gave the hero every comfort,<BR>
Gave him food and rarest viands,<BR>
Placed him in a boat of copper,<BR>
In a copper-banded vessel,<BR>
Called the winds to his assistance,<BR>
Made the North-wind guide him homeward.<BR>
Thus the skilful Ilmarinen<BR>
Travels toward his native country,<BR>
On the blue back of the waters,<BR>
Travels one day, then a second,<BR>
Till the third day evening brings him<BR>
To Wainola's peaceful meadows,<BR>
To his home in Kalevala.</P>
<P>Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Thus addresses Ilmarinen:<BR>
"O my brother, metal-artist,<BR>
Thou eternal wonder-worker,<BR>
Didst thou forge the magic Sampo,<BR>
Forge the lid in many colors?"</P>
<P>Spake the brother, Ilmarinen,<BR>
These the words the master uttered:<BR>
"Yea, I forged the magic Sampo,<BR>
Forged the lid in many colors;<BR>
To and fro the lid in rocking<BR>
Grinds one measure at the day-dawn,<BR>
Grinds a measure fit for eating,<BR>
Grinds a second for the market,<BR>
Grinds a third one for the store-house.<BR>
Louhi has the wondrous Sampo,<BR>
I have not the Bride of Beauty."</P>
