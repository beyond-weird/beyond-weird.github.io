<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE BRIDE'S FAREWELL.</H1>
<P>OSMOTAR, the bride-instructor,<BR>
Gives the wedding-guests this counsel,<BR>
Speaks these measures to the bridegroom:<BR>
"Ilmarinen, artist-brother,<BR>
Best of all my hero-brothers,<BR>
Of my mother's sons the dearest,<BR>
Gentlest, truest, bravest, grandest,<BR>
Listen well to what I tell thee<BR>
Of the Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Of thy beauteous life-companion<BR>
Bridegroom, praise thy fate hereafter,<BR>
Praise forever thy good fortune;<BR>
If thou praisest, praise sincerely,<BR>
Good the maiden thou hast wedded,<BR>
Good the bride that Ukko gives thee,<BR>
Graciously has God bestowed her.<BR>
Sound her praises to thy father,<BR>
Praise her virtues to thy mother,<BR>
Let thy heart rejoice in secret,<BR>
That thou hast the Bride of Beauty,<BR>
Lovely Maiden of the Rainbow!</P>
<P>"Brilliant near thee stands the maiden,<BR>
At thy shoulder thy companion,<BR>
Happy under thy protection,<BR>
Beautiful as golden moonlight,<BR>
Beautiful upon thy bosom,<BR>
Strong to do thy kindly bidding,<BR>
Labor with thee as thou wishest,<BR>
Rake the hay upon thy meadows,<BR>
Keep thy home in full perfection,<BR>
Spin for thee the finest linen,<BR>
Weave for thee the richest fabrics,<BR>
Make for thee the softest raiment,<BR>
Make thy weaver's loom as merry<BR>
As the cuckoo of the forest;<BR>
Make the shuttle glide in beauty<BR>
Like the ermine of the woodlands;<BR>
Make the spindle twirl as deftly<BR>
As the squirrel spins the acorn;<BR>
Village-maidens will not slumber<BR>
While thy young bride's loom is humming,<BR>
While she plies the graceful shuttle.</P>
<P>"Bridegroom of the Bride of Beauty,<BR>
Noblest of the Northland heroes,<BR>
Forge thyself a scythe for mowing,<BR>
Furnish it with oaken handle,<BR>
Carve it in thine ancient smithy,<BR>
Hammer it upon thine anvil,<BR>
Have it ready for the summer,<BR>
For the merry days of sunshine;<BR>
Take thy bride then to the lowlands,<BR>
Mow the grass upon thy meadows,<BR>
Rake the hay when it is ready,<BR>
Make the reeds and grasses rustle,<BR>
Toss the fragrant heads of clover,<BR>
Make thy hay in Kalevala<BR>
When the silver sun is shining.</P>
<P>"When the time has come for weaving,<BR>
To the loom attract the weaver,<BR>
Give to her the spools and shuttles,<BR>
Let the willing loom be worthy,<BR>
Beautiful the frame and settle;<BR>
Give to her what may be needed,<BR>
That the weaver's song may echo,<BR>
That the lathe may swing and rattle,<BR>
Ma y be heard within the village,<BR>
That the aged may remark it,<BR>
And the village-maidens question:<BR>
'Who is she that now is weaving,<BR>
What new power now plies the shuttle?'<BR>
"Make this answer to the question:<BR>
'It is my beloved weaving,<BR>
My young bride that plies the shuttle.'</P>
<P>"Shall the weaver's weft be loosened,<BR>
Shall the young bride's loom be tightened?<BR>
Do not let the weft be loosened,<BR>
Nor the weaver's loom be tightened;<BR>
Such the weaving of the daughters<BR>
Of the Moon beyond the cloudlets;<BR>
Such the spinning of the maidens<BR>
Of the Sun in high Jumala,<BR>
Of the daughters of the Great Bear,<BR>
Of the daughters of the Evening.</P>
<P>Bridegroom, thou beloved hero,<BR>
Brave descendant of thy fathers,<BR>
When thou goest on a journey,<BR>
When thou drivest on the highway,<BR>
Driving with the Rainbow-daughter,<BR>
Fairest bride of Sariola,<BR>
Do not lead her as a titmouse,<BR>
As a cuckoo of the forest,<BR>
Into unfrequented places,<BR>
Into copses of the borders,<BR>
Into brier-fields and brambles,<BR>
Into unproductive marshes;<BR>
Let her wander not, nor stumble<BR>
On opposing rocks and rubbish.<BR>
Never in her father's dwelling,<BR>
Never in her mother's court-yard,<BR>
Has she fallen into ditches,<BR>
Stumbled hard against the fences,<BR>
Run through brier-fields, nor brambles,<BR>
Fallen over rocks, nor rubbish.</P>
<P>"Magic bridegroom of Wainola,<BR>
Wise descendant of the heroes,<BR>
Never let thy young wife suffer,<BR>
Never let her be neglected,<BR>
Never let her sit in darkness,<BR>
Never leave her unattended.<BR>
Never in her father's mansion,<BR>
In the chambers of her mother,<BR>
Has she sat alone in darkness,<BR>
Has she suffered for attention;<BR>
Sat she by the crystal window,<BR>
Sat and rocked, in peace and plenty,<BR>
Evenings for her father's pleasure,<BR>
Mornings for her mother's sunshine.<BR>
Never mayest thou, O bridegroom,<BR>
Lead the Maiden of the Rainbow<BR>
To the mortar filled with sea-grass,<BR>
There to grind the bark for cooking,<BR>
There to bake her bread from stubble,<BR>
There to knead her dough from tan-bark<BR>
Never in her father's dwelling,<BR>
Never in her mother's mansion,<BR>
Was she taken to the mortar,<BR>
There to bake her bread from sea-grass.<BR>
Thou shouldst lead the Bride of Beauty<BR>
To the garner's rich abundance,<BR>
There to draw the till of barley,<BR>
Grind the flour and knead for baking,<BR>
There to brew the beer for drinking,<BR>
Wheaten flour for honey-biscuits.</P>
<P>"Hero-bridegroom of Wainola,<BR>
Never cause thy Bride of Beauty<BR>
To regret her day of marriage;<BR>
Never make her shed a tear-drop,<BR>
Never fill her cup with sorrow.<BR>
Should there ever come an evening<BR>
When thy wife shall feel unhappy,<BR>
Put the harness on thy racer,<BR>
Hitch the fleet-foot to the snow-sled; <BR>
Take her to her father's dwelling,<BR>
To the household of her mother;<BR>
Never in thy hero-lifetime,<BR>
Never while the moonbeams glimmer,<BR>
Give thy fair spouse evil treatment,<BR>
Never treat her as thy servant;<BR>
Do not bar her from the cellar,<BR>
Do not lock thy best provisions<BR>
Never in her father's mansion,<BR>
Never by her faithful mother<BR>
Was she treated as a hireling.<BR>
Honored bridegroom of the Northland,</P>
<P>Proud descendant of the fathers,<BR>
If thou treatest well thy young wife,<BR>
Worthily wilt thou be treated;<BR>
When thou goest to her homestead,<BR>
When thou visitest her father,<BR>
Thou shalt meet a cordial welcome.</P>
<P>"Censure not the Bride of Beauty,<BR>
Never grieve thy Rainbow-maiden,<BR>
Never say in tones reproachful,<BR>
She was born in lowly station,<BR>
That her father was unworthy;<BR>
Honored are thy bride's relations,<BR>
From an old-time tribe, her kindred;<BR>
When of corn they sowed a measure,<BR>
Each one's portion was a kernel;<BR>
When they sowed a cask of flax-seed,<BR>
Each received a thread of linen.<BR>
Never, never, magic husband,<BR>
Treat thy beauty-bride unkindly,<BR>
Teach her not with lash of servants,<BR>
Strike her not with thongs of leather;<BR>
Never has she wept in anguish<BR>
From the birch-whip of her mother.<BR>
Stand before her like a rampart,<BR>
Be to her a strong protection,<BR>
Do not let thy mother chide her,<BR>
Let thy father not upbraid her,<BR>
Never let thy guests offend her;<BR>
Should thy servants bring annoyance,<BR>
They may need the master's censure;<BR>
Do not harm the Bride of Beauty,<BR>
Never injure her thou lovest;<BR>
Three long years hast thou been wooing,<BR>
Hoping every mouth to win her.</P>
<P>"Counsel with the bride of heaven,<BR>
To thy young wife give instruction,<BR>
Kindly teach thy bride in secret,<BR>
In the long and dreary evenings,<BR>
When thou sittest at the fireside;<BR>
Teach one year, in words of kindness,<BR>
Teach with eyes of love a second,<BR>
In the third year teach with firmness.<BR>
If she should not heed thy teaching,<BR>
Should not hear thy kindly counsel<BR>
After three long years of effort,<BR>
Cut a reed upon the lowlands,<BR>
Cut a nettle from the border,<BR>
Teach thy wife with harder measures.<BR>
In the fourth year, if she heed not,<BR>
Threaten her with sterner treatment,<BR>
With the stalks of rougher edges,<BR>
Use not yet the thongs of leather,<BR>
Do not touch her with the birch-whip.<BR>
If she does not heed this warning,<BR>
Should she pay thee no attention,<BR>
Cut a rod upon the mountains,<BR>
Or a willow in the valleys,<BR>
Hide it underneath thy mantle,<BR>
That the stranger may not see it,<BR>
Show it to thy wife in secret,<BR>
Shame her thus to do her duty,<BR>
Strike not yet, though disobeying.<BR>
Should she disregard this warning,<BR>
Still refuse to heed thy wishes,<BR>
Then instruct her with the willow,<BR>
Use the birch-rod from the mountains<BR>
In the closet of thy dwelling,<BR>
In the attic of thy mansion;<BR>
Strike, her not upon the common,<BR>
Do not conquer her in public,<BR>
Lest the villagers should see thee,<BR>
Lest the neighbors hear her weeping,<BR>
And the forests learn thy troubles.<BR>
Touch thy wife upon the shoulders,<BR>
Let her stiffened back be softened.<BR>
Do not touch her on the forehead,<BR>
Nor upon the ears, nor visage;<BR>
If a ridge be on her forehead,<BR>
Or a blue mark on her eyelids,<BR>
Then her mother would perceive it,<BR>
And her father would take notice,<BR>
All the village-workmen see it,<BR>
And the village-women ask her<BR>
'Hast thou been in heat of battle,<BR>
Hast thou struggled in a conflict,<BR>
Or perchance the wolves have torn thee,<BR>
Or the forest-bears embraced thee,<BR>
Or the black-wolf be thy husband,<BR>
And the bear be thy protector?'"</P>
<P>By the fire-place lay a gray-beard,<BR>
On the hearth-stone lay a beggar,<BR>
And the old man spake as follows:<BR>
"Never, never, hero-husband,<BR>
Follow thou thy young wife's wishes,<BR>
Follow not her inclinations,<BR>
As, alas! I did, regretful;<BR>
Bought my bride the bread of barley,<BR>
Veal, and beer, and best of butter,<BR>
Fish and fowl of all descriptions,<BR>
Beer I bought, home-brewed and sparkling,<BR>
Wheat from all the distant nations,<BR>
All the dainties of the Northland;<BR>
All of this was unavailing,<BR>
Gave my wife no satisfaction,<BR>
Often came she to my chamber,<BR>
Tore my sable locks in frenzy,<BR>
With a visage fierce and frightful,<BR>
With her eyeballs flashing anger,<BR>
Scolding on and scolding ever,<BR>
Ever speaking words of evil,<BR>
Using epithets the vilest,<BR>
Thought me but a block for chopping.<BR>
Then I sought for other measures,<BR>
Used on her my last resources,<BR>
Cut a birch-whip in the forest,<BR>
And she spake in tones endearing;<BR>
Cut a juniper or willow,<BR>
And she called me 'hero-darling';<BR>
When with lash my wife I threatened,<BR>
Hung she on my neck with kisses."</P>
<P>Thus the bridegroom was instructed,<BR>
Thus the last advices given.</P>
<P>Then the Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Beauteous bride of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Sighing heavily and moaning,<BR>
Fell to weeping, heavy-hearted,<BR>
Spake these words from depths of sorrow:<BR>
"Near, indeed, the separation,<BR>
Near, alas! the time for parting,<BR>
Near the time for my departure;<BR>
O the anguish of the parting,<BR>
O the pain of separation,<BR>
From these walls renowned and ancient,<BR>
From this village of the Northland,<BR>
From these scenes of peace and plenty,<BR>
Where my faithful mother taught me,<BR>
Where my father gave instruction<BR>
To me in my happy childhood,<BR>
When my years were few and tender!<BR>
As a child I did not fancy,<BR>
Never thought of separation<BR>
From the confines of this cottage,<BR>
From these dear old hills and mountains,<BR>
But, alas! I now must journey,<BR>
Since I now cannot escape it;<BR>
Empty is the bowl of parting,<BR>
All the farewell-beer is taken,<BR>
And my husband's sledge is waiting,<BR>
With the break-board looking southward,<BR>
Looking from my father's dwelling.</P>
<P>"How shall I give compensation,<BR>
How repay, on my departure,<BR>
All the kindness of my mother,<BR>
All the counsel of my father,<BR>
All the friendship of my brother,<BR>
All my sister's warm affection?<BR>
Gratitude to thee, dear father,<BR>
For my former-life and blessings,<BR>
For the comforts of thy table,<BR>
For the pleasures of my childhood!<BR>
Gratitude to thee, dear mother,<BR>
For thy tender care and guidance,<BR>
For my birth and for my culture,<BR>
Nurtured by thy purest life-blood!<BR>
Gratitude to thee, dear brother,<BR>
Gratitude to thee, sweet sister,<BR>
To the servants of my childhood,<BR>
To my many friends and playmates!</P>
<P>"Never, never, aged father,<BR>
Never, thou, beloved mother,<BR>
Never, ye, my kindred spirits,<BR>
Never harbor care, nor sorrow,<BR>
Never fall to bitter weeping,<BR>
Since thy child has gone to others,<BR>
To the distant home of strangers,<BR>
To the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
From her father's fields and firesides.<BR>
Shines the Sun of the Creator,<BR>
Shines the golden Moon of Ukko,<BR>
Glitter all the stars of heaven,<BR>
In the firmament of ether,<BR>
Full as bright on other homesteads;<BR>
Not upon my father's uplands,<BR>
Not upon my home in childhood,<BR>
Shines the Star of Joyance only.</P>
<P>"Now the time has come for parting<BR>
From my father's golden firesides,<BR>
From my brother's welcome hearth-stone,<BR>
From the chambers of my sister,<BR>
From my mother's happy dwelling;<BR>
Now I leave the swamps and lowlands,<BR>
Leave the grassy vales and mountains,<BR>
Leave the crystal lakes and rivers,<BR>
Leave the shores and sandy shallows,<BR>
Leave the white-capped surging billows,<BR>
Where the maidens swim and linger,<BR>
Where the mermaids sing and frolic;<BR>
Leave the swamps to those that wander,<BR>
Leave the corn-fields to the plowman,<BR>
Leave the forests to the weary,<BR>
Leave the heather to the rover,<BR>
Leave the copses to the stranger,<BR>
Leave the alleys to the beggar,<BR>
Leave the court-yards to the rambler,<BR>
Leave the portals to the servant,<BR>
Leave the matting to the sweeper,<BR>
Leave the highways to the roebuck,<BR>
Leave the woodland-glens to lynxes,<BR>
Leave the lowlands to the wild-geese,<BR>
And the birch-tree to the cuckoo.<BR>
Now I leave these friends of childhood,<BR>
Journey southward with my husband,<BR>
To the arms of Night and Winter,<BR>
O'er the ice-grown seas of Northland.</P>
<P>"Should I once again, returning,<BR>
Pay a visit to my tribe-folk,<BR>
Mother would not hear me calling,<BR>
Father would not see me weeping,<BR>
Calling at my mother's grave-stone,<BR>
'Weeping o'er my buried father,<BR>
On their graves the fragrant flowers,<BR>
Junipers and mournful willows,<BR>
Verdure from my mother's tresses,<BR>
From the gray-beard of my father.</P>
<P>"Should I visit Sariola,<BR>
Visit once again these borders,<BR>
No one here would bid me welcome.<BR>
Nothing in these hills would greet me,<BR>
Save perchance a few things only,<BR>
By the fence a clump of osiers,<BR>
And a land-mark at the corner,<BR>
Which in early youth I planted,<BR>
When a child of little stature.</P>
<P>"Mother's kine perhaps will know me,<BR>
Which so often I have watered,<BR>
Which I oft have fed and tended,<BR>
Lowing now at my departure,<BR>
In the pasture cold and cheerless;<BR>
Sure my mother's kine will welcome<BR>
Northland's daughter home returning.<BR>
Father's steeds may not forget me,<BR>
Steeds that I have often ridden,<BR>
When a maiden free and happy,<BR>
Neighing now for me departing,<BR>
In the pasture of my brother,<BR>
In the stable of my father;<BR>
Sure my father's steeds will know me,<BR>
Bid Pohyola's daughter welcome.<BR>
Brother's faithful dogs may know me,<BR>
That I oft have fed and petted,<BR>
Dogs that I have taught to frolic,<BR>
That now mourn for me departing,<BR>
In their kennels in the court-yard,<BR>
In their kennels cold and cheerless;<BR>
Sure my brother's dogs will welcome<BR>
Pohya's daughter home returning.<BR>
But the people will not know me,<BR>
When I come these scenes to visit,<BR>
Though the fords remain as ever,<BR>
Though unchanged remain the rivers,<BR>
Though untouched the flaxen fish-nets<BR>
On the shores await my coming.</P>
<P>"Fare thou well, my dear old homestead,<BR>
Fare ye well, my native bowers;<BR>
It would give me joy unceasing<BR>
Could I linger here forever.<BR>
Now farewell, ye halls and portals,<BR>
Leading to my father's mansion;<BR>
It would give me joy unceasing<BR>
Could I linger here forever.<BR>
Fare ye well, familiar gardens<BR>
Filled with trees and fragrant flowers;<BR>
It would give me joy unceasing,<BR>
Could I linger here forever.<BR>
Send to all my farewell greetings,<BR>
To the fields, and groves, and berries;<BR>
Greet the meadows with their daisies,<BR>
Greet the borders with their fences,<BR>
Greet the lakelets with their islands,<BR>
Greet the streams with trout disporting,<BR>
Greet the hills with stately pine-trees,<BR>
And the valleys with their birches.<BR>
Fare ye well, ye streams and lakelets,<BR>
Fertile fields, and shores of ocean,<BR>
All ye aspens on the mountains,<BR>
All ye lindens of the valleys,<BR>
All ye beautiful stone-lindens,<BR>
All ye shade-trees by the cottage,<BR>
All ye junipers and willows,<BR>
All ye shrubs with berries laden,<BR>
Waving grass and fields of barley,<BR>
Arms of elms, and oaks, and alders,<BR>
Fare ye well, dear scenes of childhood,<BR>
Happiness of days departed!"</P>
<P>Ending thus, Pohyola's daughter<BR>
Left her native fields and fallows,<BR>
Left the darksome Sariola,<BR>
With her husband, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Famous son of Kalevala.</P>
<P>But the youth remained for singing,<BR>
This the chorus of the children:<BR>
"Hither came a bird of evil '<BR>
Flew in fleetness from the forest,<BR>
Came to steal away our virgin,<BR>
Came to win the Maid of Beauty;<BR>
Took away our fairest flower,<BR>
Took our mermaid from the waters,<BR>
Won her with his youth and beauty,<BR>
With his keys of ancient wisdom.<BR>
Who will lead us to the sea-beach,<BR>
Who conduct us to the rivers?<BR>
Now the buckets will be idle,<BR>
On the hooks will rest the fish-poles,<BR>
Now unswept will lie the matting,<BR>
And unswept the halls of birch-wood,<BR>
Copper goblets be unburnished,<BR>
Dark the handles of the pitchers,<BR>
Fare thou well, dear Rainbow Maiden."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, happy bridegroom,<BR>
Hastened homeward with the daughter<BR>
Of the hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
With the beauty of the Northland<BR>
Fleetly flew the hero's snow-sledge,<BR>
Loudly creaked, and roared, and rattled<BR>
Down the banks of Northland waters,<BR>
By the side of Honey-inlet,<BR>
On the back of Sandy Mountain.<BR>
Stones went rolling from the highway,<BR>
Like the winds the sledge flew onward,<BR>
On the yoke rang hoops of iron,<BR>
Loud the spotted wood resounded,<BR>
Loudly creaked the bands of willow,<BR>
All the birchen cross-bars trembled,<BR>
And the copper-bells rang music,<BR>
In the racing of the fleet-foot,<BR>
In the courser's gallop homeward;<BR>
Journeyed one day, then a second,<BR>
Journeyed still the third day onward,<BR>
In one hand the reins of magic,<BR>
While the other grasped the maiden,<BR>
One foot resting on the cross-bar,<BR>
And the other in the fur-robes.<BR>
Merrily the steed flew homeward,<BR>
Quickly did the highways shorten,<BR>
Till at last upon the third day,<BR>
As the sun was fast declining,<BR>
There appeared the blacksmith's furnace,<BR>
Nearer, Ilmarinen's dwelling,<BR>
Smoke arising high in ether,<BR>
Clouds of smoke to lofty heaven,<BR>
From the village of Wainola,<BR>
From the suitor's forge and smithy,<BR>
From the chimneys of the hero,<BR>
From the home of the successful.</P>
