<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">RUNE I.</H1>
<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">BIRTH OF WAINAMOINEN.</H1>
<P>IN primeval times, a maiden,<BR>
Beauteous Daughter of the Ether,<BR>
Passed for ages her existence<BR>
In the great expanse of heaven,<BR>
O'er the prairies yet enfolded.<BR>
Wearisome the maiden growing,<BR>
Her existence sad and hopeless,<BR>
Thus alone to live for ages<BR>
In the infinite expanses<BR>
Of the air above the sea-foam,<BR>
In the far outstretching spaces,<BR>
In a solitude of ether,<BR>
She descended to the ocean,<BR>
Waves her coach, and waves her pillow.<BR>
Thereupon the rising storm-wind<BR>
Flying from the East in fierceness,<BR>
Whips the ocean into surges,<BR>
Strikes the stars with sprays of ocean<BR>
Till the waves are white with fervor.<BR>
To and fro they toss the maiden,<BR>
Storm-encircled, hapless maiden;<BR>
With her sport the rolling billows,<BR>
With her play the storm-wind forces,<BR>
On the blue back of the waters;<BR>
On the white-wreathed waves of ocean,<BR>
Play the forces of the salt-sea,<BR>
With the lone and helpless maiden;<BR>
Till at last in full conception,<BR>
Union now of force and beauty,<BR>
Sink the storm-winds into slumber;<BR>
Overburdened now the maiden<BR>
Cannot rise above the surface;<BR>
Seven hundred years she wandered,<BR>
Ages nine of man's existence,<BR>
Swam the ocean hither, thither,<BR>
Could not rise above the waters,<BR>
Conscious only of her travail;<BR>
Seven hundred years she labored<BR>
Ere her first-born was delivered.<BR>
Thus she swam as water-mother,<BR>
Toward the east, and also southward,<BR>
Toward the west, and also northward;<BR>
Swam the sea in all directions,<BR>
Frightened at the strife of storm-winds,<BR>
Swam in travail, swam unceasing,<BR>
Ere her first-born was delivered.</P>
<P>Then began she gently weeping,<BR>
Spake these measures, heavy-hearted:<BR>
"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<BR>
Woe is me, in this my travail!<BR>
Into what have I now fallen?<BR>
Woe is me, that I unhappy,<BR>
Left my home in subtle ether,<BR>
Came to dwell amid the sea-foam,<BR>
To be tossed by rolling billows,<BR>
To be rocked by winds and waters,<BR>
On the far outstretching waters,<BR>
In the salt-sea's vast expanses,<BR>
Knowing only pain and trouble!<BR>
Better far for me, O Ukko!<BR>
Were I maiden in the Ether,<BR>
Than within these ocean-spaces,<BR>
To become a water-mother!<BR>
All this life is cold and dreary,<BR>
Painful here is every motion,<BR>
As I linger in the waters,<BR>
As I wander through the ocean.<BR>
Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,<BR>
Thou the ruler of the heavens,<BR>
Come thou hither, thou art needed,<BR>
Come thou hither, I implore thee,<BR>
To deliver me from trouble,<BR>
To deliver me in travail.<BR>
Come I pray thee, hither hasten,<BR>
Hasten more that thou art needed,<BR>
Haste and help this helpless maiden!"</P>
<P>When she ceased her supplications,<BR>
Scarce a moment onward passes,<BR>
Ere a beauteous duck descending,<BR>
Hastens toward the water-mother,<BR>
Comes a-flying hither, thither,<BR>
Seeks herself a place for nesting.<BR>
Flies she eastward, flies she westward,<BR>
Circles northward, circles southward,<BR>
Cannot find a grassy hillock,<BR>
Not the smallest bit of verdure;<BR>
Cannot find a spot protected,<BR>
Cannot find a place befitting,<BR>
Where to make her nest in safety.<BR>
Flying slowly, looking round her,<BR>
She descries no place for resting,<BR>
Thinking loud and long debating,<BR>
And her words are such as follow:<BR>
"Build I in the winds my dwelling,<BR>
On the floods my place of nesting?<BR>
Surely would the winds destroy it,<BR>
Far away the waves would wash it."</P>
<P>Then the daughter of the Ether,<BR>
Now the hapless water-mother,<BR>
Raised her shoulders out of water,<BR>
Raised her knees above the ocean,<BR>
That the duck might build her dwelling,<BR>
Build her nesting-place in safety.<BR>
Thereupon the duck in beauty,<BR>
Flying slowly, looking round her,<BR>
Spies the shoulders of the maiden,<BR>
Sees the knees of Ether's daughter,<BR>
Now the hapless water-mother,<BR>
Thinks them to be grassy hillocks,<BR>
On the blue back of the ocean.<BR>
Thence she flies and hovers slowly,<BR>
Lightly on the knee she settles,<BR>
Finds a nesting-place befitting,<BR>
Where to lay her eggs in safety.<BR>
Here she builds her humble dwelling,<BR>
Lays her eggs within, at pleasure,<BR>
Six, the golden eggs she lays there,<BR>
Then a seventh, an egg of iron;<BR>
Sits upon her eggs to hatch them,<BR>
Quickly warms them on the knee-cap<BR>
Of the hapless water-mother;<BR>
Hatches one day, then a second,<BR>
Then a third day sits and hatches.<BR>
Warmer grows the water round her,<BR>
Warmer is her bed in ocean,<BR>
While her knee with fire is kindled,<BR>
And her shoulders too are burning,<BR>
Fire in every vein is coursing.<BR>
Quick the maiden moves her shoulders,<BR>
Shakes her members in succession,<BR>
Shakes the nest from its foundation,<BR>
And the eggs fall into ocean,<BR>
Dash in pieces on the bottom<BR>
Of the deep and boundless waters.<BR>
In the sand they do not perish,<BR>
Not the pieces in the ocean;<BR>
But transformed, in wondrous beauty<BR>
All the fragments come together<BR>
Forming pieces two in number,<BR>
One the upper, one the lower,<BR>
Equal to the one, the other.<BR>
From one half the egg, the lower,<BR>
Grows the nether vault of Terra:<BR>
From the upper half remaining,<BR>
Grows the upper vault of Heaven;<BR>
From the white part come the moonbeams,<BR>
From the yellow part the sunshine,<BR>
From the motley part the starlight,<BR>
From the dark part grows the cloudage;<BR>
And the days speed onward swiftly,<BR>
Quickly do the years fly over,<BR>
From the shining of the new sun<BR>
From the lighting of the full moon.</P>
<P>Still the daughter of the Ether,<BR>
Swims the sea as water-mother,<BR>
With the floods outstretched before her,<BR>
And behind her sky and ocean.<BR>
Finally about the ninth year,<BR>
In the summer of the tenth year,<BR>
Lifts her head above the surface,<BR>
Lifts her forehead from the waters,<BR>
And begins at last her workings,<BR>
Now commences her creations,<BR>
On the azure water-ridges,<BR>
On the mighty waste before her.<BR>
Where her hand she turned in water,<BR>
There arose a fertile hillock;<BR>
Wheresoe'er her foot she rested,<BR>
There she made a hole for fishes;<BR>
Where she dived beneath the waters,<BR>
Fell the many deeps of ocean;<BR>
Where upon her side she turned her,<BR>
There the level banks have risen;<BR>
Where her head was pointed landward,<BR>
There appeared wide bays and inlets;<BR>
When from shore she swam a distance,<BR>
And upon her back she rested,<BR>
There the rocks she made and fashioned,<BR>
And the hidden reefs created,<BR>
Where the ships are wrecked so often,<BR>
Where so many lives have perished.</P>
<P>Thus created were the islands,<BR>
Rocks were fastened in the ocean,<BR>
Pillars of the sky were planted,<BR>
Fields and forests were created,<BR>
Checkered stones of many colors,<BR>
Gleaming in the silver sunlight,<BR>
All the rocks stood well established;<BR>
But the singer, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Had not yet beheld the sunshine,<BR>
Had not seen the golden moonlight,<BR>
Still remaining undelivered.<BR>
Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
Lingering within his dungeon<BR>
Thirty summers altogether,<BR>
And of winters, also thirty,<BR>
Peaceful on the waste of waters,<BR>
On the broad-sea's yielding bosom,<BR>
Well reflected, long considered,<BR>
How unborn to live and flourish<BR>
In the spaces wrapped in darkness,<BR>
In uncomfortable limits,<BR>
Where he had not seen the moonlight,<BR>
Had not seen the silver sunshine.<BR>
Thereupon these words be uttered,<BR>
Let himself be heard in this wise:<BR>
"Take, O Moon, I pray thee, take me,<BR>
Take me, thou, O Sun above me,<BR>
Take me, thou O Bear of heaven,<BR>
From this dark and dreary prison,<BR>
From these unbefitting portals,<BR>
From this narrow place of resting,<BR>
From this dark and gloomy dwelling,<BR>
Hence to wander from the ocean,<BR>
Hence to walk upon the islands,<BR>
On the dry land walk and wander,<BR>
Like an ancient hero wander,<BR>
Walk in open air and breathe it,<BR>
Thus to see the moon at evening,<BR>
Thus to see the silver sunlight,<BR>
Thus to see the Bear in heaven,<BR>
That the stars I may consider."</P>
<P>Since the Moon refused to free him,<BR>
And the Sun would not deliver,<BR>
Nor the Great Bear give assistance,<BR>
His existence growing weary,<BR>
And his life but an annoyance,<BR>
Bursts he then the outer portals<BR>
Of his dark and dismal fortress;<BR>
With his strong, but unnamed finger,<BR>
Opens he the lock resisting;<BR>
With the toes upon his left foot,<BR>
With the fingers of his right hand,<BR>
Creeps he through the yielding portals<BR>
To the threshold of his dwelling;<BR>
On his knees across the threshold,<BR>
Throws himself head foremost, forward<BR>
Plunges into deeps of ocean,<BR>
Plunges hither, plunges thither,<BR>
Turning with his hands the water;<BR>
Swims he northward, swims he southward,<BR>
Swims he eastward, swims he westward,<BR>
Studying his new surroundings.</P>
<P>Thus our hero reached the water,<BR>
Rested five years in the ocean,<BR>
Six long years, and even seven years,<BR>
Till the autumn of the eighth year,<BR>
When at last he leaves the waters,<BR>
Stops upon a promontory,<BR>
On a coast bereft of verdure;<BR>
On his knees he leaves the ocean,<BR>
On the land he plants his right foot,<BR>
On the solid ground his left foot,<BR>
Quickly turns his hands about him,<BR>
Stands erect to see the sunshine,<BR>
Stands to see the golden moonlight,<BR>
That he may behold the Great Bear,<BR>
That he may the stars consider.<BR>
Thus our hero, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Thus the wonderful enchanter<BR>
Was delivered from his mother,<BR>
Ilmatar, the Ether's daughter.</P>
