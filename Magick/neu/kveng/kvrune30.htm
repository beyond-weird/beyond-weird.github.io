<P>LEMMINKAINEN, reckless ministrel,<I>[sic]</I><BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Hastens as the dawn is breaking,<BR>
At the dawning of the morning,<BR>
To the resting-place of vessels,<BR>
To the harbor of the island,<BR>
Finds the vessels sorely weeping,<BR>
Hears the wailing of the rigging,<BR>
And the ships intone this chorus:<BR>
"Must we wretched lie forever<BR>
In the harbor of this island,<BR>
Here to dry and fall in pieces?<BR>
Ahti wars no more in Northland,<BR>
Wars no more for sixty summers,<BR>
Even should he thirst for silver,<BR>
Should he wish the gold of battle."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen struck his vessels<BR>
With his gloves adorned with copper,<BR>
And addressed the ships as follows:<BR>
"Mourn no more, my ships of fir-wood,<BR>
Strong and hardy is your rigging,<BR>
To the wars ye soon may hasten,<BR>
Hasten to the seas of battle;<BR>
Warriors may swarm your cabins<BR>
Ere to-morrow's morn has risen.!'"</P>
<P>Then the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
Hastened to his aged mother,<BR>
Spake to her the words that follow:<BR>
"Weep no longer, faithful mother,<BR>
Do not sorrow for thy hero,<BR>
Should he leave for scenes of battle,<BR>
For the hostile fields of Pohya;<BR>
Sweet revenge has fired my spirit,<BR>
And my soul is well determined,<BR>
To avenge the shameful insult<BR>
That the warriors of Northland<BR>
Gave to thee, defenseless woman."</P>
<P>To restrain him seeks his mother,<BR>
Warns her son again of danger:<BR>
"Do not go, my son beloved,<BR>
To the wars in Sariola;<BR>
There the jaws of Death await thee,<BR>
Fell destruction lies before thee!"</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, little heeding,<BR>
Still determined, speaks as follows:<BR>
"Where may I secure a swordsman,<BR>
Worthy of my race of heroes,<BR>
To assist me in the combat?<BR>
Often I have heard of Tiera,<BR>
Heard of Kura of the islands,<BR>
This one I will take to help me,<BR>
Magic hero of the broadsword;<BR>
He will aid me in the combat,<BR>
Will protect me from destruction."</P>
<P>Then he wandered to the islands,<BR>
On the way to Tiera's hamlet,<BR>
These the words that Ahti utters<BR>
As he nears the ancient dwellings:<BR>
Dearest friend, my noble Tiera,<BR>
My, beloved hero-brother,<BR>
Dost thou other times remember,<BR>
When we fought and bled together,<BR>
On the battle-fields of Northland?<BR>
There was not an island-village<BR>
Where there were not seven mansions,<BR>
In each mansion seven heroes,<BR>
And not one of all these foemen<BR>
Whom we did not slay with broadswords,<BR>
Victims of our skill and valor."</P>
<P>Near the window sat the father<BR>
Whittling out a javelin-handle;<BR>
Near the threshold sat the mother<BR>
Skimming cream and making butter;<BR>
Near the portal stood the brother<BR>
Working on a sledge of birch-wood<BR>
Near the bridge-pass were the sisters<BR>
Washing out their varied garments.<BR>
Spake the father from the window,<BR>
From the threshold spake the mother,<BR>
From the portals spake the brother,<BR>
And the sisters from the bridge-pass:<BR>
"Tiera has no time for combat,<BR>
And his broadsword cannot battle;<BR>
Tiera is but late a bridegroom,<BR>
Still unveiled his bride awaits him."</P>
<P>Near the hearth was Tiera lying,<BR>
Lying by the fire was Kura,<BR>
Hastily one foot was shoeing,<BR>
While the other lay in waiting.<BR>
From the hook he takes his girdle,<BR>
Buckles it around his body,<BR>
Takes a javelin from its resting,<BR>
Not the largest, nor the smallest,<BR>
Buckles on his mighty scabbard,<BR>
Dons his heavy mail of copper;<BR>
On each javelin pranced a charger,<BR>
Wolves were howling from his helmet,<BR>
On the rings the bears were growling.<BR>
Tiera poised his mighty javelin,<BR>
Launched the spear upon its errand;<BR>
Hurled the shaft across the pasture,<BR>
To the border of the forest,<BR>
O'er the clay-fields of Pohyola,<BR>
O'er the green and fragrant meadows,<BR>
Through the distant bills of Northland.<BR>
Then great Tiera touched his javelin<BR>
To the mighty spear of Ahti,<BR>
Pledged his aid to Lemminkainen,<BR>
As his combatant and comrade.<BR>
Thereupon wild Kaukomieli<BR>
Pushed his boat upon the waters;<BR>
Like the serpent through the heather,<BR>
Like the creeping of the adder,<BR>
Sails the boat away to Pohya,<BR>
O'er the seas of Sariola.</P>
<P>Quick the wicked hostess, Louhi,<BR>
Sends the black-frost of the heavens<BR>
To the waters of Pohyola,<BR>
O'er the far-extending sea-plains,<BR>
Gave the black-frost these directions:<BR>
"Much-loved Frost, my son and hero,<BR>
Whom thy mother has instructed,<BR>
Hasten whither I may send thee,<BR>
Go wherever I command thee,<BR>
Freeze the vessel of this hero,<BR>
Lemminkainen's bark of magic,<BR>
On the broad back of the ocean,<BR>
On the far-extending waters;<BR>
Freeze the wizard in his vessel,<BR>
Freeze to ice the wicked Ahti,<BR>
That he never more may wander,<BR>
Never waken while thou livest,<BR>
Or at least till I shall free him,<BR>
Wake him from his icy slumber!"</P>
<P>Frost, the son of wicked parents,<BR>
Hero-son of evil manners,<BR>
Hastens off to freeze the ocean,<BR>
Goes to fasten down the flood-gates,<BR>
Goes to still the ocean-currents.<BR>
As he hastens on his journey,<BR>
Takes the leaves from all the forest,<BR>
Strips the meadows of their verdure,<BR>
Robs the flowers of their colors.<BR>
When his journey he had ended,<BR>
Gained the border of the ocean,<BR>
Gained the sea-shore curved and endless,<BR>
On the first night of his visit,<BR>
Freezes he the lakes and rivers,<BR>
Freezes too the shore of ocean,<BR>
Freezes not the ocean-billows,<BR>
Does not check the ocean-currents.<BR>
On the sea a finch is resting,<BR>
Bird of song upon the waters,<BR>
But his feet are not yet frozen,<BR>
Neither is his head endangered.<BR>
When the second night Frost lingered,<BR>
He began to grow important,<BR>
He became a fierce intruder,<BR>
Fearless grew in his invasions,<BR>
Freezes everything before him;<BR>
Sends the fiercest cold of Northland,<BR>
Turns to ice the boundless waters.<BR>
Ever thicker, thicker, thicker,<BR>
Grew the ice on sea and ocean,<BR>
Ever deeper, deeper, deeper,<BR>
Fell the snow on field and forest,<BR>
Froze the hero's ship of beauty,<BR>
Cold and lifeless bark of Ahti;<BR>
Sought to freeze wild Lemminkainen,<BR>
Freeze him lifeless as his vessel,<BR>
Asked the minstrel for his life-blood,<BR>
For his ears, and feet, and fingers.</P>
<P>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Angry grew and filled with magic,<BR>
Hurled the black-frost to the fire-god,<BR>
Threw him to the fiery furnace,<BR>
Held him in his forge of iron,<BR>
Then addressed the frost as follows:<BR>
"Frost, thou evil son of Northland,<BR>
Dire and only son of Winter,<BR>
Let my members not be stiffened,<BR>
Neither ears, nor feet, nor fingers,<BR>
Neither let my head be frozen.<BR>
Thou hast other things to feed on,<BR>
Many other beads to stiffen;<BR>
Leave in peace the flesh of heroes,<BR>
Let this minstrel pass in safety,<BR>
Freeze the swamps, and lakes, and rivers,<BR>
Fens and forests, bills and valleys;<BR>
Let the cold stones grow still colder,<BR>
Freeze the willows in the waters,<BR>
Let the aspens freeze and suffer,<BR>
Let the bark peel from the birch-trees,<BR>
Let the Pines burst on the mountains,<BR>
Let this hero pass in safety,<BR>
Do not let his locks be stiffened.</P>
<P>"If all these prove insufficient,<BR>
Feed on other worthy matters;<BR>
Lot the hot stones freeze asunder,<BR>
Let the flaming rocks be frozen,<BR>
Freeze the fiery blocks of iron,<BR>
Freeze to ice the iron mountains;<BR>
Stiffen well the mighty Wuoksi,<BR>
Let Imatra freeze to silence;<BR>
Freeze the sacred stream and whirlpoo4<BR>
Let their boiling billows stiffen,<BR>
Or thine origin I'll sing thee,<BR>
Tell thy lineage of evil.<BR>
Well I know thine evil nature,<BR>
Know thine origin and power,<BR>
Whence thou camest, where thou goest,<BR>
Know thine ancestry of evil.<BR>
Thou wert born upon the aspen,<BR>
Wert conceived upon the willows,<BR>
Near the borders of Pohyola,<BR>
In the courts of dismal Northland;<BR>
Sin-begotten was thy father,<BR>
And thy mother was Dishonor.</P>
<P>"While in infancy who fed thee<BR>
While thy mother could not nurse thee?<BR>
Surely thou wert fed by adders,<BR>
Nursed by foul and slimy serpents;<BR>
North-winds rocked thee into slumber,<BR>
Cradled thee in roughest weather,<BR>
In the worst of willow-marshes,<BR>
In the springs forever flowing,<BR>
Evil-born and evil-nurtured,<BR>
Grew to be an evil genius,<BR>
Evil was thy mind and spirit,<BR>
And the infant still was nameless,<BR>
Till the name of Frost was given<BR>
To the progeny of evil.</P>
<P>"Then the young lad lived in hedges,<BR>
Dwelt among the weeds and willows,<BR>
Lived in springs in days of summer,<BR>
On the borders of the marshes,<BR>
Tore the lindens in the winter,<BR>
Stormed among the glens and forests,<BR>
Raged among the sacred birch-trees,<BR>
Rattled in the alder-branches,<BR>
Froze the trees, the shoots, the grasses,<BR>
Evened all the plains and prairies,<BR>
Ate the leaves within the woodlands,<BR>
Made the stalks drop down their blossoms,<BR>
Peeled the bark on weeds and willows.</P>
<P>"Thou hast grown to large proportions,<BR>
Hast become too tall and mighty;<BR>
Dost thou labor to benumb me,<BR>
Dost thou wish mine ears and fingers,<BR>
Of my feet wouldst thou deprive me?<BR>
Do not strive to freeze this hero,<BR>
In his anguish and misfortune;<BR>
In my stockings I shall kindle<BR>
Fire to drive thee from my presence,<BR>
In my shoes lay flaming faggots,<BR>
Coals of fire in every garment,<BR>
Heated sandstones in my rigging;<BR>
Thus will hold thee at a distance.<BR>
Then thine evil form I'll banish<BR>
To the farthest Northland borders;<BR>
When thy journey is completed,<BR>
When thy home is reached in safety,<BR>
Freeze the caldrons in the castle,<BR>
Freeze the coal upon the hearthstone,<BR>
In the dough, the hands of women,<BR>
On its mother's lap, the infant,<BR>
Freeze the colt beside its mother.</P>
<P>"If thou shouldst not heed this order,<BR>
I shall banish thee still farther,<BR>
To the carbon-piles of Hisi,<BR>
To the chimney-hearth of Lempo,<BR>
Hurl thee to his fiery furnace,<BR>
Lay thee on the iron anvil,<BR>
That thy body may be hammered<BR>
With the sledges of the blacksmith,<BR>
May be pounded into atoms,<BR>
Twixt the anvil and the hammer.</P>
<P>"If thou shouldst not heed this order,<BR>
Shouldst not leave me to my freedom,<BR>
Know I still another kingdom,<BR>
Know another spot of resting;<BR>
I shall drive thee to the summer,<BR>
Lead thy tongue to warmer climates,<BR>
There a prisoner to suffer,<BR>
Never to obtain thy freedom<BR>
Till thy spirit I deliver,<BR>
Till I go myself and free thee."</P>
<P>Wicked Frost, the son of Winter,<BR>
Saw the magic bird of evil<BR>
Hovering above his spirit,<BR>
Straightway prayed for Ahti's mercy,<BR>
These the words the Frost-fiend uttered:<BR>
"Let us now agree together,<BR>
Neither one to harm the other,<BR>
Never in the course of ages,<BR>
Never while the moonlight glimmers<BR>
On the snow-capped hills of Northland.<BR>
If thou hearest that I bring thee<BR>
Cold to freeze thy feet and fingers,<BR>
Hurl me to the fiery furnace,<BR>
Hammer me upon the anvil<BR>
Of the blacksmith, Ilmarinen;<BR>
Lead my tongue to warmer climates,<BR>
Banish me to lands of summer,<BR>
There a prisoner to suffer,<BR>
Nevermore to gain my freedom."</P>
<P>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Left his vessel in the ocean,<BR>
Frozen in the ice of Northland,<BR>
Left his warlike boat forever,<BR>
Started on his cheerless journey<BR>
To the borders of Pohyola,<BR>
And the mighty Tiera followed<BR>
In the tracks of his companion.<BR>
On the ice they journeyed northward<BR>
Briskly walked upon the ice-plain,<BR>
Walked one day, and then a second,<BR>
Till the closing of the third day,<BR>
When the Hunger-land approached them,<BR>
When appeared Starvation-island.</P>
<P>Here the hardy Lemminkainen<BR>
Hastened forward to the castle,<BR>
This the hero's prayer and question;<BR>
"Is there food within this castle,<BR>
Fish or fowl within its larders,<BR>
To refresh us on our journey,<BR>
Mighty heroes, cold and weary?<BR>
When the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Found no food within the castle,<BR>
Neither fish, nor fowl, nor bacon,<BR>
Thus he cursed it and departed:<BR>
"May the fire destroy these chambers,<BR>
May the waters flood this dwelling,<BR>
Wash it to the seas of Mana!"</P>
<P>Then they hastened onward, onward,<BR>
Hastened on through field and forest,<BR>
Over by-ways long untrodden,<BR>
Over unknown paths and snow-fields;<BR>
Here the hardy Lemminkainen,<BR>
Reckless hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Pulled the soft wool from the ledges,<BR>
Gathered lichens from the tree-trunks,<BR>
Wove them into magic stockings,<BR>
Wove them into shoes and mittens,<BR>
On the settles of the hoar-frost,<BR>
In the stinging cold of Northland.</P>
<P>Then he sought to find some pathway,<BR>
That would guide their wayward footsteps,<BR>
And the hero spake as follows:<BR>
"O thou Tiera, friend beloved,<BR>
Shall we reach our destination,<BR>
Wandering for days together,<BR>
Through these Northland fields and forests?<BR>
Kura thus replies to Ahti:<BR>
"We, alas! have come for vengeance,<BR>
Come for blood and retribution,<BR>
To the battle-fields of Northland,<BR>
To the dismal Sariola,<BR>
Here to leave our souls and bodies,<BR>
Here to starve, and freeze, and perish,<BR>
In the dreariest of places,<BR>
In this sun-forsaken country!<BR>
Never shall we gain the knowledge,<BR>
Never learn it, never tell it,<BR>
Which the pathway that can guide us<BR>
To the forest-beds to suffer,<BR>
To the Pohya-plains to perish,<BR>
In the home-land of the ravens,<BR>
Fitting food for crows and eagles.<BR>
Often do the Northland vultures<BR>
Hither come to feed their fledgelings;<BR>
Hither bring the birds of heaven<BR>
Bits of flesh and blood of heroes;<BR>
Often do the beaks of ravens<BR>
Tear the flesh of kindred corpses,<BR>
Often do the eagle's talons<BR>
Carry bones and trembling vitals,<BR>
Such as ours, to feed their nestlings,<BR>
In their rocky homes and ledges.</P>
<P>"Oh! my mother can but wonder,<BR>
Never can divine the answer,<BR>
Where her reckless son is roaming,<BR>
Where her hero's blood is flowing,<BR>
Whether in the swamps and lowlands<BR>
Whether in the heat of battle,<BR>
Or upon the waves of the ocean,<BR>
Or upon the hop-feld mountains,<BR>
Or along some forest by-way.<BR>
Nothing can her mind discover<BR>
Of the frailest of her heroes,<BR>
Only think that he has perished.<BR>
Thus the hoary-headed mother<BR>
Weeps and murmurs in her chambers:<BR>
'Where is now my son beloved,<BR>
In the kingdom of Manala?<BR>
Sow thy crops, thou dread Tuoni,<BR>
Harrow well the fields of Kalma!<BR>
Now the bow receives its respite<BR>
From the fingers of my Tiera;<BR>
Bow and arrow now are useless,<BR>
Now the merry birds can fatten<BR>
In the fields, and fens, and forests;<BR>
Bears may live in dens of freedom,<BR>
On the fields may sport the elk-herds.'"<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Thus it is, mine aged mother,<BR>
Thou that gavest me existence!<BR>
Thou hast reared thy broods of chickens,<BR>
Hatched and reared thy flights of white-swans<BR>
All of them the winds have scattered,<BR>
Or the evil Lempo frightened;<BR>
One flew hither, and one thither,<BR>
And a third one, lost forever!<BR>
Think thou of our former pleasures,<BR>
Of our better days together,<BR>
When I wandered like the flowers,<BR>
Like the berry in the meadows.<BR>
Many saw my form majestic,<BR>
Many thought me well-proportioned.<BR>
Now is not as then with Ahti,<BR>
Into evil days have fallen,<BR>
Since I see but storms and darkness!<BR>
Then my eyes beheld but sunshine,<BR>
Then we did not weep and murmur,<BR>
Did not fill our hearts with sorrow,<BR>
When the maids in joy were singing,<BR>
When the virgins twined their tresses;<BR>
Then the women joined in joyance,<BR>
Whether brides were happy-wedded,<BR>
Whether bridegrooms choose discreetly,<BR>
Whether they were wise or unwise.</P>
<P>"But we must not grow disheartened,<BR>
Let the Island-maidens cheer us;<BR>
Here we are not yet enchanted,<BR>
Not bewitched by magic singing,<BR>
On the paths not left to perish,<BR>
Sink and perish on our journey.<BR>
Full of youth we should not suffer,<BR>
Strong, we should not die unworthy,<BR>
Whom the wizards have enchanted,<BR>
Have bewitched with songs of magic;<BR>
Sorcerers may charm and conquer,<BR>
Bury them within their dungeons,<BR>
Hide them spell-bound in their cabins.<BR>
Let the wizards charm each other,<BR>
And bewitch their magic offspring,<BR>
Bring their tribes to fell destruction.<BR>
Never did my gray-haired father<BR>
Bow submission to a wizard,<BR>
Offer worship to magicians.<BR>
These the words my father uttered,<BR>
These the thoughts his son advances:<BR>
'Guard us, thou O great Creator,<BR>
Shield us, thou O God of mercy,<BR>
With thine arms of grace protect us,<BR>
Help us with thy strength and wisdom,<BR>
Guide the minds of all thy heroes,<BR>
Keep aright the thoughts of women,<BR>
Keep the old from speaking evil,<BR>
Keep the young from sin and folly,<BR>
Be to us a help forever,<BR>
Be our Guardian and our Father,<BR>
That our children may not wander<BR>
From the ways of their Creator,<BR>
From the path that God has given!'"</P>
<P>Then the hero Lemminkainen,<BR>
Made from cares the fleetest racers,<BR>
Sable racers from his sorrows,<BR>
Reins he made from days of evil,<BR>
From his sacred pains made saddles.<BR>
To the saddle, quickly springing,<BR>
Galloped he away from trouble,<BR>
To his dear and aged mother;<BR>
And his comrade, faithful Tiera,<BR>
Galloped to his Island-dwelling.</P>
<P>Now departs wild Lemminkainen,<BR>
Brave and reckless Kaukomieli,<BR>
From these ancient songs and legends;<BR>
Only guides his faithful Kura<BR>
To his waiting bride and kindred,<BR>
While these lays and incantations<BR>
Shall be turned to other heroes.</P>
