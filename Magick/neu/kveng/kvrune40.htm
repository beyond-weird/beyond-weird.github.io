<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">BIRTH OF THE HARP.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Onward steered his goodly vessel,<BR>
From the isle of Lemminkainen,<BR>
From the borders of the village;<BR>
Steered his war-ship through the waters,<BR>
Sang it o'er the ocean-billows,<BR>
Joyful steered it to Pohyola.</P>
<P>On the banks were maidens standing,<BR>
And the daughters spake these measures:<BR>
"List the music on the waters!<BR>
What this wonderful rejoicing,<BR>
What this singing on the billows?<BR>
Far more beautiful this singing,<BR>
This rejoicing on the waters,<BR>
Than our ears have heard in Northland."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
Steered his wonder-vessel onward,<BR>
Steered one day along the sea-shore,<BR>
Steered the next through shallow waters,<BR>
Steered the third day through the rivers.<BR>
Then the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
Suddenly some words remembered,<BR>
He had heard along the fire-stream<BR>
Near the cataract and whirlpool,<BR>
And these words the hero uttered:<BR>
"Cease, O cataract, thy roaring,<BR>
Cease, O waterfall, thy foaming!<BR>
Maidens of the foam and current,<BR>
Sitting on the rocks in water,<BR>
On the stone-blocks in the river,<BR>
Take the foam and white-capped billows<BR>
In your arms and still their anger,<BR>
That our ships may pass in safety!<BR>
Aged dame beneath the eddy,<BR>
Thou that livest in the sea-foam,<BR>
Swimming, rise above the waters,<BR>
Lift thy head above the whirlpool,<BR>
Gather well the foam and billows<BR>
In thine arms and still their fury,<BR>
That our ship may pass in safety!<BR>
Ye, O rocks beneath the current,<BR>
Underneath the angry waters,<BR>
Lower well your heads of danger,<BR>
Sink below our magic vessel,<BR>
That our ship may pass in safety!</P>
<P>"Should this prayer prove inefficient,<BR>
Kimmo, hero son of Kammo,<BR>
Bore an outlet with thine auger,<BR>
Cut a channel for this vessel<BR>
Through the rocks beneath the waters,<BR>
That our ship may pass in safety!<BR>
Should all this prove unavailing,<BR>
Hostess of the running water,<BR>
Change to moss these rocky ledges,<BR>
Change this vessel to an air-bag,<BR>
That between these rocks and billows<BR>
It may float, and pass in safety!</P>
<P>"Virgin of the sacred whirlpool,<BR>
Thou whose home is in the river,<BR>
Spin from flax of strongest fiber,<BR>
Spin a thread of crimson color,<BR>
Draw it gently through the water,<BR>
That the thread our ship may follow,<BR>
And our vessel pass in safety!<BR>
Goddess of the helm, thou daughter<BR>
Of the ocean-winds and sea-foam,<BR>
Take thy helm endowed with mercy,<BR>
Guide our vessel through these dangers,<BR>
Hasten through these floods enchanted,<BR>
Passing by the house of envy,<BR>
By the gates of the enchanters,<BR>
That our ship may pass in safety!</P>
<P>"Should this prayer prove inefficient,<BR>
Ukko, Ruler of creation, .<BR>
Guide our vessel with thy fire-sword,<BR>
Guide it with thy blade of lightning,<BR>
Through the dangers of these rapids,<BR>
Through the cataract and whirlpool,<BR>
That our ship may pass in safety!"</P>
<P>Thereupon old Wainamoinen<BR>
Steered his boat through winds and waters,<BR>
Through the rocky chinks and channels,<BR>
Through the surges wildly tossing;<BR>
And the vessel passed in safety<BR>
Through the dangers of the current,<BR>
Through the sacred stream and whirlpool.<BR>
As it gains the open waters,<BR>
Gains at length the broad-lake's bosom,<BR>
Suddenly its motion ceases,<BR>
On some object firmly anchored.<BR>
Thereupon young Ilmarinen,<BR>
With the aid of Lemminkainen,<BR>
Plunges in the lake the rudder,<BR>
Struggles with the aid of magic;<BR>
But he cannot move the vessel,<BR>
Cannot free it from its moorings.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Thus addresses his companion:<BR>
"O thou hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Stoop and look beneath this war-ship,<BR>
See on what this boat is anchored,<BR>
See on what our craft is banging,<BR>
In this broad expanse of water,<BR>
In the broad-lake's deepest soundings,<BR>
If upon some rock or tree-snag,<BR>
Or upon some other hindrance."</P>
<P>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Looked beneath the magic vessel,<BR>
Peering through the crystal waters,<BR>
Spake and these the words be uttered:<BR>
"Does not rest upon a sand-bar,<BR>
Nor upon a rock, nor tree-snag,<BR>
But upon the back and shoulders<BR>
Of the mighty pike of Northland,<BR>
On the fin-bones of the monster."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
Spake these words to Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Many things we find in water,<BR>
Rocks, and trees, and fish, and sea-duck;<BR>
Are we on the pike's broad shoulders,<BR>
On the fin-bones of the monster,<BR>
Pierce the waters with thy broadsword,<BR>
Cut the monster into pieces."</P>
<P>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen,<BR>
Reckless wizard, filled with courage,<BR>
Pulls his broadsword from his girdle,<BR>
From its sheath, the bone-divider,<BR>
Strikes with might of magic hero,<BR>
Headlong falls into the water;<BR>
And the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Lifts the wizard from the river,<BR>
Speaks these words to dripping Ahti:<BR>
"Accidents will come to mortals,<BR>
Accidents will come to heroes,<BR>
By the hundreds, by the thousands,<BR>
Even to the gods above us!"</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Drew his broadsword from his girdle,<BR>
From its sheath his blade of honor,<BR>
Tried to slay the pike of Northland<BR>
With the weapon of his forging;<BR>
But he broke his sword in pieces,<BR>
Did not harm the water-monster.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
Thus addresses his companions<BR>
"Poor apologies for heroes!<BR>
When occasion calls for victors,<BR>
When we need some great magician,<BR>
Need a hero filled with valor,<BR>
Then the arm that comes is feeble,<BR>
And the mind insane or witless,<BR>
Strength and reason gone to others!"</P>
<P>Straightway ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Miracle of strength and wisdom,<BR>
Draws his fire-sword from his girdle,<BR>
Wields the mighty blade of magic,<BR>
Strikes the waters as the lightning,<BR>
Strikes the pike beneath the vessel,<BR>
And impales, the mighty monster;<BR>
Raises him above the surface,<BR>
In the air the pike he circles,<BR>
Cuts the monster into pieces;<BR>
To the water falls the pike-tail,<BR>
To the ship the head and body;<BR>
Easily the ship moves onward.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<BR>
To the shore directs his vessel,<BR>
On the strand the boat he anchors,<BR>
Looks in every nook and corner<BR>
For the fragments of the monster;<BR>
Gathers well the parts together,<BR>
Speaks these words to those about him:<BR>
"Let the oldest of the heroes<BR>
Slice for me the pike of Northland,<BR>
Slice the fish to fitting morsels."</P>
<P>Answered all the men and heroes,<BR>
And the maidens spake, assenting:<BR>
"Worthier the catcher's fingers,<BR>
Wainamoinen's hands are sacred!"</P>
<P>Thereupon the wise magician<BR>
Drew a fish-knife from his girdle,<BR>
Sliced the pike to fitting morsels,<BR>
Spake again to those about him:<BR>
"Let the youngest of the maidens<BR>
Cook for me the pike of Northland,<BR>
Set for me a goodly dinner!"</P>
<P>All the maidens quick responded,<BR>
All the virgins vied in cooking;<BR>
Neither could outdo the other,<BR>
Thus the pike was rendered toothsome.<BR>
Feasted all the old magicians,<BR>
Feasted all the younger heroes,<BR>
Feasted all the men and maidens;<BR>
On the rocks were left the fish-bones,<BR>
Only relics of their feasting.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Looked upon the pile of fragments,<BR>
On the fish-bones looked and pondered,<BR>
Spake these words in meditation:<BR>
"Wondrous things might be constructed<BR>
From the relies of this monster,<BR>
Were they in the blacksmith's furnace,<BR>
In the hands of the magician,<BR>
In the hands of Ilmarinen."<BR>
Spake the blacksmith of Wainola:<BR>
"Nothing fine can be constructed<BR>
From the bones and teeth of fishes<BR>
By the skillful forger-artist,<BR>
By the hands of the magician."<BR>
These the words of Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Something wondrous might be builded<BR>
From these jaws, and teeth, and fish-bones;<BR>
Might a magic harp be fashioned,<BR>
Could an artist be discovered<BR>
That could shape them to my wishes."</P>
<P>But he found no fish-bone artist<BR>
That could shape the harp of joyance<BR>
From the relies of their feasting,<BR>
From the jaw-bones of the monster,<BR>
To the will of the magician.<BR>
Thereupon wise Wainamoinen<BR>
Set himself at work designing;<BR>
Quick became a fish-bone artist,<BR>
Made a harp of wondrous beauty,<BR>
Lasting joy and pride of Suomi.<BR>
Whence the harp's enchanting arches?<BR>
From the jaw-bones of the monster.<BR>
Whence the necessary harp-pins?<BR>
From the pike-teeth firmly fastened.<BR>
Whence the sweetly singing harp-strings?<BR>
From the tail of Lempo's stallion.<BR>
Thus was born the harp of magic<BR>
From the mighty pike of Northland,<BR>
From the relies from the feasting<BR>
Of the heroes of Wainola.<BR>
All the young men came to view it,<BR>
All the aged with their children,<BR>
Mothers with their beauteous daughters,<BR>
Maidens with their golden tresses;<BR>
All the people on the islands<BR>
Came to view the harp of joyance,<BR>
Pride and beauty of the Northland.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Let the aged try the harp-strings,<BR>
Gave it to the young magicians,<BR>
To the dames and to their daughters,<BR>
To the maidens, silver-tinselled,<BR>
To the singers of Wainola.<BR>
When the young men touched the harp-strings,<BR>
Then arose the notes of discord;<BR>
When the aged played upon it,<BR>
Dissonance their only music.<BR>
Spake the wizard, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"O ye witless, worthless children,<BR>
O ye senseless, useless maidens,<BR>
O ye wisdom-lacking heroes,<BR>
Cannot play this harp of magic,<BR>
Cannot touch the notes of concord!<BR>
Give to me this thing or beauty,<BR>
Hither bring the harp of fish-bones,<BR>
Let me try my skillful fingers."<BR>
Lemminkainen touched the harp-strings,<BR>
Carefully the strings adjusted,<BR>
Turned the harp in all directions,<BR>
Fingered all the strings in sequence,<BR>
Played the instrument of wonder,<BR>
But it did not speak in concord,<BR>
Did not sing the notes of joyance.<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"There is none among these maidens,<BR>
None among these youthful heroes,<BR>
None among the old magicians<BR>
That can play the harp of magic,<BR>
Touch the notes of joy and pleasure.<BR>
Let us take the harp to Pohya,<BR>
There to find a skillful player<BR>
That can touch the strings in concord."</P>
<P>Then they sailed to Sariola,<BR>
To Pohyola took the wonder,<BR>
There to find the harp a master.<BR>
All the heroes of Pohyola,<BR>
All the boys and all the maidens,<BR>
Ancient dames, and bearded minstrels,<BR>
Vainly touched the harp of beauty.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Took the harp-strings in her fingers;<BR>
All the youth of Sariola,<BR>
Youth of every tribe and station,<BR>
Vainly touched the harp of fish-bone;<BR>
Could not find the notes of joyance,<BR>
Dissonance their only pleasure;<BR>
Shrieked the harp-strings like the whirlwinds,<BR>
All the tones wore harsh and frightful.</P>
<P>In a corner slept a blind man,<BR>
Lay a gray-beard on the oven,<BR>
Rousing from his couch of slumber,<BR>
Murmured thus within his corner:<BR>
"Cease at once this wretched playing,<BR>
Make an end of all this discord;<BR>
It benumbs mine ears for hearing,<BR>
Racks my brain, despoils my senses,<BR>
Robs me of the sweets of sleeping.<BR>
If the harp of Suomi's people<BR>
True delight cannot engender,<BR>
Cannot bring the notes of pleasure,<BR>
Cannot sing to sleep the aged,<BR>
Cast the thing upon the waters,<BR>
Sink it in the deeps of ocean,<BR>
Take it back to Kalevala,<BR>
To the home of him that made it,<BR>
To the bands of its creator."</P>
<P>Thereupon the harp made answer,<BR>
To the blind man sang these measures:<BR>
"Shall not fall upon the waters,<BR>
Shall not sink within the ocean;<BR>
I will play for my creator,<BR>
Sing in melody and concord<BR>
In the fingers of my master."</P>
<P>Carefully the harp was carried<BR>
To the artist that had made it<BR>
To the hands of its creator,<BR>
To the feet of Wainamoinen.</P>
