<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">LEMMINKAINEN'S RESTORATION.</H1>
<P>LEMMINKAINEN'S aged mother<BR>
Anxious roams about the islands,<BR>
Anxious wonders in her chambers,<BR>
What the fate of Lemminkainen,<BR>
Why her son so long has tarried;<BR>
Thinks that something ill has happened<BR>
To her hero in Pohyola.<BR>
Sad, indeed, the mother's anguish,<BR>
As in vain she waits his coming,<BR>
As in vain she asks the question,<BR>
Where her daring son is roaming,<BR>
Whether to the fir-tree mountain,<BR>
Whether to the distant heath-land,<BR>
Or upon the broad-sea's ridges,<BR>
On the floods and rolling waters,<BR>
To the war's contending armies,<BR>
To the heat and din of battle,<BR>
Steeped in blood of valiant heroes,<BR>
Evidence of fatal warfare.</P>
<P>Daily does the wife Kyllikki<BR>
Look about her vacant chamber,<BR>
In the home of Lemminkainen,<BR>
At the court of Kaukomieli;<BR>
Looks at evening, looks at morning,<BR>
Looks, perchance, upon his hair-brush,<BR>
Sees alas! the blood-drops oozing,<BR>
Oozing from the golden bristles,<BR>
And the blood-drops, scarlet-colored.</P>
<P>Then the beauteous wife, Kyllikki,<BR>
Spake these words in deeps of anguish:<BR>
"Dead or wounded is my husband,<BR>
Or at best is filled with trouble,<BR>
Lost perhaps in Northland forests,<BR>
In some glen unknown to heroes,<BR>
Since alas! the blood is flowing<BR>
From the brush of Lemminkainen,<BR>
Red drops oozing from the bristles."</P>
<P>Thereupon the anxious mother<BR>
Looks upon the bleeding hair-brush<BR>
And begins this wail of anguish:<BR>
"Woe is me, my life hard-fated,<BR>
Woe is me, all joy departed!<BR>
For alas! my son and hero,<BR>
Valiant hero of the islands,<BR>
Son of trouble and misfortune!<BR>
Some sad fate has overtaken<BR>
My ill-fated Lemminkainen!<BR>
Blood is flowing from his hair-brush,<BR>
Oozing from its golden bristles,<BR>
And the drops are scarlet-colored."</P>
<P>Quick her garment's hem she clutches,<BR>
On her arm she throws her long-robes,<BR>
Fleetly flies upon her journey;<BR>
With her might she hastens northward,<BR>
Mountains tremble from her footsteps,<BR>
Valleys rise and heights are lowered,<BR>
Highlands soon become as lowlands,<BR>
All the hills and valleys levelled.<BR>
Soon she gains the Northland village,<BR>
Quickly asks about her hero,<BR>
These the words the mother utters:<BR>
"O thou hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Where hast thou my Lemminkainen?<BR>
Tell me of my son and hero!"</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Gives this answer to the mother:<BR>
"Nothing know I of thy hero,<BR>
Of the hero of the islands;<BR>
Where thy son may be I know not,<BR>
Cannot lend the information;<BR>
Once I gave thy son a courser,<BR>
Hitched the racer to his snow-sledge,<BR>
This the last of Lemminkainen;<BR>
May perchance be drowned in Wuhne,<BR>
Frozen In the icy ocean,<BR>
Fallen prey to wolves in hunger,<BR>
In a bear's den may have perished."<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answers:<BR>
"Thou art only speaking falsehoods,<BR>
Northland wolves cannot devour us,<BR>
Nor the bears kill Kaukomieli;<BR>
He can slay the wolves of Pohya<BR>
With the fingers of his left hand;<BR>
Bears of Northland he would silence<BR>
With the magic of his singing.</P>
<P>"Hostess of Pohyola, tell me<BR>
Whither thou hast sent my hero;<BR>
I shall burst thy many garners,<BR>
Shall destroy the magic Sampo,<BR>
If thou dost not tell me truly<BR>
Where to find my Lemminkainen."<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"I have well thy hero treated,<BR>
Well my court has entertained him,<BR>
Gave him of my rarest viands,<BR>
Fed him at my well-filled tables,<BR>
Placed him in a boat of copper,<BR>
Thus to float adown the current,<BR>
This the last of Lemminkainen;<BR>
Cannot tell where he has wandered.<BR>
Whether in the foam of waters,<BR>
Whether in the boiling torrent,<BR>
Whether in the drowning whirlpool."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen's mother answers:<BR>
Thou again art speaking falsely;<BR>
Tell me now the truth I pray thee,<BR>
Make an end of thy deception,<BR>
Where is now my Lemminkainen,<BR>
Whither hast thou sent my hero,<BR>
Young and daring son of Kalew?<BR>
If a third time thou deceivest,<BR>
I will send thee plagues, unnumbered,<BR>
I will send thee fell destruction,<BR>
Certain death will overtake thee."<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"This the third time that I answer,<BR>
This the truth that I shall tell thee:<BR>
I have sent the Kalew-hero<BR>
To the Hisi-fields and forests,<BR>
There to hunt the moose of Lempo;<BR>
Sent him then to catch the fire-horse,<BR>
Catch the fire-expiring stallion,<BR>
On the distant plains of Juutas,<BR>
In the realm of cruel Hisi.<BR>
Then I sent him to the Death-stream,<BR>
In the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
With his bow and but one arrow,<BR>
There to shoot the swan as dowry<BR>
For my best and fairest daughter;<BR>
Have not heard about thy hero<BR>
Since he left for Tuonela;<BR>
May in misery have fallen,<BR>
May have perished in Manala;<BR>
Has not come to ask my daughter,<BR>
Has not come to woo the maiden,<BR>
Since he left to hunt the death-swan."</P>
<P>Now the mother seeks her lost one,<BR>
For her son she weeps and trembles,<BR>
Like the wolf she bounds through fenlands,<BR>
Like the bear, through forest thickets,<BR>
Like the wild-boar, through the marshes,<BR>
Like the hare, along the sea-coast,<BR>
To the sea-point, like the hedgehog<BR>
Like the wild-duck swims the waters,<BR>
Casts the rubbish from her pathway,<BR>
Tramples down opposing brush-wood,<BR>
Stops at nothing in her journey<BR>
Seeks a long time for her hero,<BR>
Seeks, and seeks, and does not find him.</P>
<P>Now she asks the trees the question,<BR>
And the forest gives this answer:<BR>
"We have care enough already,<BR>
Cannot think about thy matters;<BR>
Cruel fates have we to battle,<BR>
Pitiful our own misfortunes!<BR>
We are felled and chopped in pieces,<BR>
Cut in blocks for hero-fancy,<BR>
We are burned to death as fuel,<BR>
No one cares how much we suffer."</P>
<P>Now again the mother wanders,<BR>
Seeks again her long-lost hero,<BR>
Seeks, and seeks, and does not find him.<BR>
Paths arise and come to meet her,<BR>
And she questions thus the pathways:<BR>
"Paths of hope that God has fashioned,<BR>
Have ye seen my Lemminkainen,<BR>
Has my son and golden hero<BR>
Travelled through thy many kingdoms?"<BR>
Sad, the many pathways answer:<BR>
"We ourselves have cares sufficient,<BR>
Cannot watch thy son and hero,<BR>
Wretched are the lives of pathways,<BR>
Deep indeed our own misfortunes;<BR>
We are trodden by, the red-deer,<BR>
By the wolves, and bears, and roebucks,<BR>
Driven o'er by heavy cart-wheels,<BR>
By the feet of dogs are trodden,<BR>
Trodden under foot of heroes,<BR>
Foot-paths for contending armies."</P>
<P>Seeks again the frantic mother,<BR>
Seeks her long-lost son and hero,<BR>
Seeks, and seeks, and does not find him;<BR>
Finds the Moon within her orbit,<BR>
Asks the Moon in pleading measures:<BR>
"Golden Moon, whom God has stationed<BR>
In the heavens, the Sun's companion,<BR>
Hast thou seen my Kaukomieli,<BR>
Hast thou seen my silver apple,<BR>
Anywhere in thy dominions? "<BR>
Thus the golden Moon makes answer:<BR>
"I have trouble all-sufficient,<BR>
Cannot watch thy daring hero;<BR>
Long the journey I must travel,<BR>
Sad the fate to me befallen,<BR>
Pitiful mine own misfortunes,<BR>
All alone the nights to wander,<BR>
Shine alone without a respite,<BR>
In the winter ever watching,<BR>
In the summer sink and perish."</P>
<P>Still the mother seeks, and wanders,<BR>
Seeks, and does not find her hero,<BR>
Sees the Sun in the horizon,<BR>
And the mother thus entreats him:<BR>
Silver Sun, whom God has fashioned,<BR>
Thou that giveth warmth and comfort,<BR>
Hast thou lately seen my hero,<BR>
Hast thou seen my Lemminkainen,<BR>
Wandering in thy dominions?"<BR>
Thus the Sun in kindness answers:<BR>
"Surely has thy hero perished,<BR>
To ingratitude a victim;<BR>
Lemminkainen died and vanished<BR>
In Tuoni's fatal river,<BR>
In the waters of Manala,<BR>
In the sacred stream and whirlpool,<BR>
In the cataract and rapids,<BR>
Sank within the drowning current<BR>
To the realm of Tuonela,<BR>
To Manala's lower regions."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen's mother weeping,<BR>
Wailing in the deeps of anguish,<BR>
Mourns the fate of Kaukomieli,<BR>
Hastens to the Northland smithy,<BR>
To the forge of Ilmarinen,<BR>
These the words the mother utters:<BR>
"Ilmarinen, metal-artist,<BR>
Thou that long ago wert forging,<BR>
Forging earth a concave cover,<BR>
Yesterday wert forging wonders,<BR>
Forge thou now, immortal blacksmith,<BR>
Forge a rake with shaft of copper,<BR>
Forge the teeth of strongest metal,<BR>
Teeth in length a hundred fathoms,<BR>
And five hundred long the handle."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen does as bidden,<BR>
Makes the rake in full perfection.<BR>
Lemminkainen's anxious mother<BR>
Takes the magic rake and hastens<BR>
To the river of Tuoni,<BR>
Praying to the Sun as follows:<BR>
"Thou, O Sun, by God created,<BR>
Thou that shinest on thy Maker,<BR>
Shine for me in heat of magic,<BR>
Give me warmth, and strength, and courage,<BR>
Shine a third time full of power,<BR>
Lull to sleep the wicked people,<BR>
Still the people of Manala,<BR>
Quiet all Tuoni's empire."</P>
<P>Thereupon the sun of Ukko,<BR>
Dearest child of the Creator,<BR>
Flying through the groves of Northland,<BR>
Sitting on a curving birch-tree,<BR>
Shines a little while in ardor,<BR>
Shines again in greater fervor,<BR>
Shines a third time full of power,<BR>
Lulls to sleep the wicked people<BR>
In the Manala home and kingdom,<BR>
Still the heroes with their broadswords,<BR>
Makes the lancers halt and totter,<BR>
Stills the stoutest of the spearmen,<BR>
Quiets Tuoni's ghastly empire.<BR>
Now the Sun retires in magic,<BR>
Hovers here and there a moment<BR>
Over Tuoni's hapless sleepers,<BR>
Hastens upward to his station,<BR>
To his Jumala home and kingdom.</P>
<P>Lemminkainen's faithful mother<BR>
Takes the rake of magic metals,<BR>
Rakes the Tuoni river bottoms,<BR>
Rakes the cataract and whirlpool,<BR>
Rakes the swift and boiling current<BR>
Of the sacred stream of death-land,<BR>
In the Manala home and kingdom.<BR>
Searching for her long-lost hero,<BR>
Rakes a long time, finding nothing;<BR>
Now she wades the river deeper,<BR>
To her belt in mud and water,<BR>
Deeper, deeper, rakes the death-stream,<BR>
Rakes the river's deepest caverns,<BR>
Raking up and down the current,<BR>
Till at last she finds his tunic,<BR>
Heavy-hearted, finds his jacket;<BR>
Rakes again and rakes unceasing,<BR>
Finds the hero's shoes and stockings,<BR>
Sorely troubled, finds these relies;<BR>
Now she wades the river deeper,<BR>
Rakes the Manala shoals and shallows,<BR>
Rakes the deeps at every angle;<BR>
As she draws the rake the third time<BR>
From the Tuoni shores and waters,<BR>
In the rake she finds the body<BR>
Of her long-lost Lemminkainen,<BR>
In the metal teeth entangled,<BR>
In the rake with copper handle.</P>
<P>Thus the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Thus the son of Kalevala,<BR>
Was recovered from the bottom<BR>
Of the Manala lake and river.<BR>
There were wanting many fragments,<BR>
Half the head, a hand, a fore-arm,<BR>
Many other smaller portions,<BR>
Life, above all else, was missing.<BR>
Then the mother, well reflecting,<BR>
Spake these words in bitter weeping:<BR>
"From these fragments, with my magic,<BR>
I will bring to life my hero."</P>
<P>Hearing this, the raven answered,<BR>
Spake these measures to the mother:<BR>
"There is not in these a hero,<BR>
Thou canst not revive these fragments;<BR>
Eels have fed upon his body,<BR>
On his eyes have fed the whiting;<BR>
Cast the dead upon the waters,<BR>
On the streams of Tuonela,<BR>
Let him there become a walrus,<BR>
Or a seal, or whale, or porpoise."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen's mother does not<BR>
Cast the dead upon the waters,<BR>
On the streams of Tuonela,<BR>
She again with hope and courage,<BR>
Rakes the river lengthwise, crosswise,<BR>
Through the Manala pools and caverns,<BR>
Rakes up half the head, a fore-arm,<BR>
Finds a hand and half the back-bone,<BR>
Many other smaller portions;<BR>
Shapes her son from all the fragments,<BR>
Shapes anew her Lemminkainen,<BR>
Flesh to flesh with skill she places,<BR>
Gives the bones their proper stations,<BR>
Binds one member to the other,<BR>
Joins the ends of severed vessels,<BR>
Counts the threads of all the venules,<BR>
Knits the parts in apposition;<BR>
Then this prayer the mother offers:</P>
<P>"Suonetar, thou slender virgin,<BR>
Goddess of the veins of heroes,<BR>
Skilful spinner of the vessels,<BR>
With thy slender, silver spindle,<BR>
With thy spinning-wheel of copper,<BR>
Set in frame of molten silver,<BR>
Come thou hither, thou art needed;<BR>
Bring the instruments for mending,<BR>
Firmly knit the veins together,<BR>
At the end join well the venules,<BR>
In the wounds that still are open,<BR>
In the members that are injured.</P>
<P>"Should this aid be inefficient;<BR>
There is living in the ether,<BR>
In a boat enriched with silver,<BR>
In a copper boat, a maiden,<BR>
That can bring to thee assistance.<BR>
Come, O maiden, from the ether,<BR>
Virgin from the belt of heaven,<BR>
Row throughout these veins, O maiden,<BR>
Row through all these lifeless members,<BR>
Through the channels of the long-bones,<BR>
Row through every form of tissue.<BR>
Set the vessels in their places,<BR>
Lay the heart in right position,<BR>
Make the pulses beat together,<BR>
Join the smallest of the veinlets,<BR>
And unite with skill the sinews.<BR>
Take thou now a slender needle,<BR>
Silken thread within its eyelet,<BR>
Ply the silver needle gently,<BR>
Sew with care the wounds together.</P>
<P>"Should this aid be inefficient,<BR>
Thou, O God, that knowest all things,<BR>
Come and give us thine assistance,<BR>
Harness thou thy fleetest racer<BR>
Call to aid thy strongest courser,<BR>
In thy scarlet sledge come swiftly,<BR>
Drive through all the bones and channels,<BR>
Drive throughout these lifeless tissues,<BR>
Drive thy courser through each vessel,<BR>
Bind the flesh and bones securely,<BR>
In the joints put finest silver,<BR>
Purest gold in all the fissures.</P>
<P>"Where the skin is broken open,<BR>
Where the veins are torn asunder,<BR>
Mend these injuries with magic;<BR>
Where the blood has left the body,<BR>
There make new blood flow abundant;<BR>
Where the bones are rudely broken,<BR>
Set the parts in full perfection;<BR>
Where the flesh is bruised and loosened,<BR>
Touch the wounds with magic balsam,<BR>
Do not leave a part imperfect;<BR>
Bone, and vein, and nerve, and sinew,<BR>
Heart, and brain, and gland, and vessel,<BR>
Heal as Thou alone canst heal them."</P>
<P>These the means the mother uses,<BR>
Thus she joins the lifeless members,<BR>
Thus she heals the death-like tissues,<BR>
Thus restores her son and hero<BR>
To his former life and likeness;<BR>
All his veins are knit together,<BR>
All their ends are firmly fastened,<BR>
All the parts in apposition,<BR>
Life returns, but speech is wanting,<BR>
Deaf and dumb, and blind, and senseless.<BR>
Now the mother speaks as follows:<BR>
"Where may I procure the balsam,<BR>
Where the drops of magic honey,<BR>
To anoint my son and hero,<BR>
Thus to heal my Lemminkainen,<BR>
That again his month may open,<BR>
May again begin his singing,<BR>
Speak again in words of wonder,<BR>
Sing again his incantations?</P>
<P>"Tiny bee, thou honey-birdling,<BR>
Lord of all the forest flowers,<BR>
Fly away and gather honey,<BR>
Bring to me the forest-sweetness,<BR>
Found in Metsola's rich gardens,<BR>
And in Tapio's fragrant meadows,<BR>
From the petals of the flowers,<BR>
From the blooming herbs and grasses,<BR>
Thus to heal my hero's anguish,<BR>
Thus to heal his wounds of evil."</P>
<P>Thereupon the honey-birdling<BR>
Flies away on wings of swiftness,<BR>
Into Metsola's rich gardens,<BR>
Into Tapio's flowery meadows,<BR>
Gathers sweetness from the meadows,<BR>
With the tongue distills the honey<BR>
From the cups of seven flowers,<BR>
From the bloom of countless grasses;<BR>
Quick from Metsola returning,<BR>
Flying, humming darting onward,<BR>
With his winglets honey-laden,<BR>
With the store of sweetest odors,<BR>
To the mother brings the balsam.<BR>
Lemminkainen's anxious mother<BR>
Takes the balm of magic virtues,<BR>
And anoints the injured hero,<BR>
Heals his wounds and stills his anguish;<BR>
But the balm is inefficient,<BR>
For her son is deaf and speechless.</P>
<P>Then again out-speaks the mother:<BR>
Lemminkainen's Restoration.<BR>
"Little bee, my honey-birdling,<BR>
Fly away in one direction,<BR>
Fly across the seven oceans,<BR>
In the eighth, a magic island,<BR>
Where the honey is enchanted,<BR>
To the distant Turi-castles,<BR>
To the chambers of Palwoinen;<BR>
There the honey is effective,<BR>
There, the wonder-working balsam,<BR>
This may heal the wounded hero;<BR>
Bring me of this magic ointment,<BR>
That I may anoint his eyelids,<BR>
May restore his injured senses."</P>
<P>Thereupon the honey-birdling<BR>
Flew away o'er seven oceans,<BR>
To the old enchanted island;<BR>
Flies one day, and then a second,<BR>
On the verdure does not settle,<BR>
Does not rest upon the flowers;<BR>
Flies a third day, fleetly onward,<BR>
Till a third day evening brings him<BR>
To the island in the ocean,<BR>
To the meadows rich in honey,<BR>
To the cataract and fire-flow,<BR>
To the sacred stream and whirlpool.</P>
<P>There the honey was preparing,<BR>
There the magic balm distilling<BR>
In the tiny earthen vessels,<BR>
In the burnished copper kettles,<BR>
Smaller than a maiden's thimble,<BR>
Smaller than the tips of fingers.<BR>
Faithfully the busy insect<BR>
Gathers the enchanted honey<BR>
From the magic Turi-cuplets<BR>
In the chambers of Palwoinen.</P>
<P>Time had gone but little distance,<BR>
Ere the bee came loudly humming<BR>
Flying fleetly, honey-laden;<BR>
In his arms were seven vessels,<BR>
Seven, the vessels on each shoulder;<BR>
All were filled with honey-balsam,<BR>
With the balm of magic virtues.</P>
<P>Lemminkainen's tireless mother<BR>
Quick anoints her speechless hero,<BR>
With the magic Turi-balsam,<BR>
With the balm of seven virtues;<BR>
Nine the times that she anoints him<BR>
With the honey of Palwoinen,<BR>
With the wonder-working balsam;<BR>
But the balm is inefficient,<BR>
For the hero still is speechless.<BR>
Then again out-speaks the mother:<BR>
"Honey-bee, thou ether birdling,<BR>
Fly a third time on thy journey,<BR>
Fly away to high Jumala,<BR>
Fly thou to the seventh heaven,<BR>
Honey there thou'lt find abundant,<BR>
Balsam of the highest virtue,<BR>
Only used by the Creator,<BR>
Only made from the breath of Ukko.<BR>
God anoints his faithful children,<BR>
With the honey of his wisdom,<BR>
When they feel the pangs of sorrow,<BR>
When they meet the powers of evil.<BR>
Dip thy winglets in this honey,<BR>
Steep thy plumage in His sweetness,<BR>
Hither bring the all-sufficient<BR>
Balsam of the great Creator;<BR>
This will still my hero's anguish,<BR>
This will heal his wounded tissues,<BR>
This restore his long-lost vision,<BR>
Make the Northland hills re-echo<BR>
With the magic of his singing,<BR>
With his wonderful enchantment."<BR>
Thus the honey-bee made answer:<BR>
"I can never fly to heaven,<BR>
To the seventh of the heavens,<BR>
To the distant home of Ukko,<BR>
With these wings of little virtue."<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"Thou canst surely fly to heaven,<BR>
To the seventh of the heavens,<BR>
O'er the Moon, beneath the sunshine,<BR>
Through the dim and distant starlight.<BR>
On the first day, flying upward,<BR>
Thou wilt near the Moon in heaven,<BR>
Fan the brow of Kootamoinen;<BR>
On the second thou canst rest thee<BR>
On the shoulders of Otava;<BR>
On the third day, flying higher,<BR>
Rest upon the seven starlets,<BR>
On the heads of Hetewan&egrave;;<BR>
Short the journey that is left thee,<BR>
Inconsiderable the distance<BR>
To the home of mighty Ukko,<BR>
To the dwellings of the blessed."</P>
<P>Thereupon the bee arising,<BR>
From the earth flies swiftly upward,<BR>
Hastens on with graceful motion,<BR>
By his tiny wings borne heavenward,<BR>
In the paths of golden moonbeams,<BR>
Touches on the Moon's bright borders,<BR>
Fans the brow of Kootamoinen,<BR>
Rests upon Otava's shoulders,<BR>
Hastens to the seven starlets.,<BR>
To the heads of Hetewan&egrave;,<BR>
Flies to the Creator's castle,<BR>
To the home of generous Ukko,<BR>
Finds the remedy preparing,<BR>
Finds the balm of life distilling,<BR>
In the silver-tinted caldrons,<BR>
In the purest golden kettles;<BR>
On one side, heart-easing honey,<BR>
On a second, balm of joyance,<BR>
On the third, life-giving balsam.<BR>
Here the magic bee, selecting,<BR>
Culls the sweet, life-giving balsam,<BR>
Gathers too, heart-easing honey,<BR>
Heavy-laden hastens homeward.</P>
<P>Time had traveled little distance,<BR>
Ere the busy bee came humming<BR>
To the anxious mother waiting,<BR>
In his arms a hundred cuplets,<BR>
And a thousand other vessels,<BR>
Filled with honey, filled with balsam,<BR>
Filled with the balm of the Creator.</P>
<P>Lemminkainen's mother quickly<BR>
Takes them on her, tongue and tests them,<BR>
Finds a balsam all-sufficient.<BR>
Then the mother spake as follows:<BR>
"I have found the long-sought balsam,<BR>
Found the remedy of Ukko,<BR>
Where-with God anoints his people,<BR>
Gives them life, and faith, and wisdom,<BR>
Heals their wounds and stills their anguish,<BR>
Makes them strong against temptation,<BR>
Guards them from the evil-doers."</P>
<P>Now the mother well anointing,<BR>
Heals her son, the magic singer,<BR>
Eyes, and ears, and tongue, and temples,<BR>
Breaks, and cuts, and seams, anointing,<BR>
Touching well the life-blood centres,<BR>
Speaks these words of magic import<BR>
To the sleeping Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Wake, arise from out thy slumber,<BR>
From the worst of low conditions,<BR>
From thy state of dire misfortune!"</P>
<P>Slowly wakes the son and hero,<BR>
Rises from the depths of slumber,<BR>
Speaks again in magic accents,<BR>
These the first words of the singer:<BR>
"Long, indeed, have I been sleeping,<BR>
Long unconscious of existence,<BR>
But my sleep was full of sweetness,<BR>
Sweet the sleep in Tuonela,<BR>
Knowing neither joy nor sorrow!"<BR>
This the answer of his mother:<BR>
"Longer still thou wouldst have slumbered,<BR>
Were it not for me, thy, mother;<BR>
Tell me now, my son beloved,<BR>
Tell me that I well may hear thee,<BR>
Who enticed thee to Manala,<BR>
To the river of Tuoni,<BR>
To the fatal stream and whirlpool?"</P>
<P>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Gave this answer to his mother:<BR>
"Nasshut, the decrepit shepherd<BR>
Of the flocks of Sariola,<BR>
Blind, and halt, and poor, and wretched,<BR>
And to whom I did a favor;<BR>
From the slumber-land of envy<BR>
Nasshut sent me to Manala,<BR>
To the river of Tuoni;<BR>
Sent a serpent from the waters,<BR>
Sent an adder from the death-stream,<BR>
Through the heart of Lemminkainen;<BR>
Did not recognize the serpent,<BR>
Could not speak the serpent-language,<BR>
Did not know the sting of adders."<BR>
Spake again the ancient mother:<BR>
"O thou son of little insight,<BR>
Senseless hero, fool-magician,<BR>
Thou didst boast betimes thy magic<BR>
To enchant the wise enchanters,<BR>
On the dismal shores of Lapland,<BR>
Thou didst think to banish heroes,<BR>
From the borders of Pohyola;<BR>
Didst not know the sting of serpents,<BR>
Didst not know the reed of waters,<BR>
Nor the magic word-protector!<BR>
Learn the origin of serpents,<BR>
Whence the poison of the adder.</P>
<P>"In the floods was born the serpent,<BR>
From the marrow of the gray-duck,<BR>
From the brain of ocean-swallows;<BR>
Suoyatar had made saliva,<BR>
Cast it on the waves of ocean,<BR>
Currents drove it outward, onward,<BR>
Softly shone the sun upon it,<BR>
By the winds 'twas gently cradled,<BR>
Gently nursed by winds and waters,<BR>
By the waves was driven shoreward,<BR>
Landed by the surging billows.<BR>
Thus the serpent, thing of evil,<BR>
Filling all the world with trouble,<BR>
Was created in the waters<BR>
Born from Suoyatar, its maker."</P>
<P>Then the mother of the hero<BR>
Rocked her son to rest and comfort,<BR>
Rocked him to his former being,<BR>
To his former life and spirit,<BR>
Into greater magic powers;<BR>
Wiser, handsomer than ever<BR>
Grew the hero of the islands;<BR>
But his heart was full of trouble,<BR>
And his mother, ever watchful,<BR>
Asked the cause of his dejection.<BR>
This is Lemminkainen's answer:<BR>
"This the cause of all my sorrow;<BR>
Far away my heart is roaming,<BR>
All my thoughts forever wander<BR>
To the Northland's blooming virgins,<BR>
To the maids of braided tresses.<BR>
Northland's ugly hostess, Louhi,<BR>
Will not give to me her daughter,<BR>
Fairest maiden of Pohyola,<BR>
Till I kill the swan of Mana,<BR>
With my bow and but one arrow,<BR>
In the river of Tuoni.<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answers,<BR>
In the sacred stream and whirlpool.<BR>
"Let the swan swim on in safety,<BR>
Give the water-bird his freedom,<BR>
In the river of Manala,<BR>
In the whirlpool of Tuoni;<BR>
Leave the maiden in the Northland.,<BR>
With her charms and fading beauty;<BR>
With thy fond and faithful mother,<BR>
Go at once to Kalevala,<BR>
To thy native fields and fallows.<BR>
Praise thy fortune, all sufficient,<BR>
Praise, above all else, thy Maker.<BR>
Ukko gave thee aid when needed,<BR>
Thou wert saved by thy Creator,<BR>
From thy long and hopeless slumber,<BR>
In the waters of Tuoni,<BR>
In the chambers of Manala.<BR>
I unaided could not save thee,<BR>
Could not give the least assistance;<BR>
God alone, omniscient Ukko,<BR>
First and last of the creators,<BR>
Can revive the dead and dying,<BR>
Can protect his worthy people<BR>
From the waters of Manala, .<BR>
From the fatal stream and whirlpool,<BR>
In the kingdom of Tuoni."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, filled with wisdom,<BR>
With his fond and faithful mother,<BR>
Hastened straightway on his journey<BR>
To his distant home and kindred,<BR>
To the Wainola fields and meadows,<BR>
To the plains of Kalevala.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</P>
<P>Here I leave my Kaukomieli,<BR>
Leave my hero Lemminkainen,<BR>
Long I leave him from my singing,<BR>
Turn my song to other heroes,<BR>
Send it forth on other pathways,<BR>
Sing some other golden legend.</P>
