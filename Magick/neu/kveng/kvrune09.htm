<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">ORIGIN OF IRON.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, thus encouraged,<BR>
Quickly rises in his snow-sledge,<BR>
Asking no one for assistance,<BR>
Straightway hastens to the cottage,<BR>
Takes a seat within the dwelling.<BR>
Come two maids with silver pitchers,<BR>
Bringing also golden goblets;<BR>
Dip they up a very little,<BR>
But the very smallest measure<BR>
Of the blood of the magician,<BR>
From the wounds of Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>From the fire-place calls the old man,<BR>
Thus the gray-beard asks the minstrel:<BR>
"Tell me who thou art of heroes,<BR>
Who of all the great magicians?<BR>
Lo! thy blood fills seven sea-boats,<BR>
Eight of largest birchen vessels,<BR>
Flowing from some hero's veinlets,<BR>
From the wounds of some magician.<BR>
Other matters I would ask thee;<BR>
Sing the cause of this thy trouble,<BR>
Sing to me the source of metals,<BR>
Sing the origin of iron,<BR>
How at first it was created."</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Made this answer to the gray-beard:<BR>
"Know I well the source of metals,<BR>
Know the origin of iron;<BR>
f can tell bow steel is fashioned.<BR>
Of the mothers air is oldest,<BR>
Water is the oldest brother,<BR>
And the fire is second brother,<BR>
And the youngest brother, iron;<BR>
Ukko is the first creator.<BR>
Ukko, maker of the heavens,<BR>
Cut apart the air and water,<BR>
Ere was born the metal, iron.<BR>
Ukko, maker of the heavens,<BR>
Firmly rubbed his hands together,<BR>
Firmly pressed them on his knee-cap,<BR>
Then arose three lovely maidens,<BR>
Three most beautiful of daughters;<BR>
These were mothers of the iron,<BR>
And of steel of bright-blue color.<BR>
Tremblingly they walked the heavens,<BR>
Walked the clouds with silver linings,<BR>
With their bosoms overflowing<BR>
With the milk of future iron,<BR>
Flowing on and flowing ever,<BR>
From the bright rims of the cloudlets<BR>
To the earth, the valleys filling,<BR>
To the slumber-calling waters.</P>
<P>"Ukko's eldest daughter sprinkled<BR>
Black milk over river channels<BR>
And the second daughter sprinkled<BR>
White milk over hills and mountains,<BR>
While the youngest daughter sprinkled<BR>
Red milk over seas and oceans.<BR>
Whero the black milk had been sprinked,<BR>
Grew the dark and ductile iron;<BR>
Where the white milk had been sprinkled.<BR>
Grew the iron, lighter-colored;<BR>
Where the red milk had been sprinkled,<BR>
Grew the red and brittle iron.</P>
<P>"After Time had gone a distance,<BR>
Iron hastened Fire to visit,<BR>
His beloved elder brother,<BR>
Thus to know his brother better.<BR>
Straightway Fire began his roarings,<BR>
Labored to consume his brother,<BR>
His beloved younger brother.<BR>
Straightway Iron sees his danger,<BR>
Saves himself by fleetly fleeing,<BR>
From the fiery flame's advances,<BR>
Fleeing hither, fleeing thither,<BR>
Fleeing still and taking shelter<BR>
In the swamps and in the valleys,<BR>
In the springs that loudly bubble,<BR>
By the rivers winding seaward,<BR>
On the broad backs of the marshes,<BR>
Where the swans their nests have builded,<BR>
Where the wild geese hatch their goslings.</P>
<P>"Thus is iron in the swamp-lands,<BR>
Stretching by the water-courses,<BR>
Hidden well for many ages,<BR>
Hidden in the birchen forests,<BR>
But he could not hide forever<BR>
From the searchings of his brother;<BR>
Here and there the fire has caught him,<BR>
Caught and brought him to his furnace,<BR>
That the spears, and swords, and axes,<BR>
Might be forged and duly hammered.<BR>
In the swamps ran blackened waters,<BR>
From the heath the bears came ambling,<BR>
And the wolves ran through the marshes.<BR>
Iron then made his appearance,<BR>
Where the feet of wolves had trodden,<BR>
Where the paws of bears had trampled.</P>
<P>"Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Came to earth to work the metal;<BR>
He was born upon the Coal-mount,<BR>
Skilled and nurtured in the coal-fields;<BR>
In one hand, a copper hammer,<BR>
In the other, tongs of iron;<BR>
In the night was born the blacksmith,<BR>
In the morn he built his smithy,<BR>
Sought with care a favored hillock,<BR>
Where the winds might fill his bellows;<BR>
Found a hillock in the swamp-lands,<BR>
Where the iron hid abundant;<BR>
There he built his smelting furnace,<BR>
There he laid his leathern bellows,<BR>
Hastened where the wolves had travelled,<BR>
Followed where the bears had trampled,<BR>
Found the iron's young formations,<BR>
In the wolf-tracks of the marshes,<BR>
In the foot-prints of the gray-bear.</P>
<P>"Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
'Thus addressed the sleeping iron:<BR>
Thou most useful of the metals,<BR>
Thou art sleeping in the marshes,<BR>
Thou art hid in low conditions,<BR>
Where the wolf treads in the swamp-lands,<BR>
Where the bear sleeps in the thickets.<BR>
Hast thou thought and well considered,<BR>
What would be thy future station,<BR>
Should I place thee in the furnace,<BR>
Thus to make thee free and useful?'</P>
<P>"Then was Iron sorely frightened,<BR>
Much distressed and filled with horror,<BR>
When of Fire he heard the mention,<BR>
Mention of his fell destroyer.</P>
<P>"Then again speaks Ilmarinen,<BR>
Thus the smith addresses Iron:<BR>
'Be not frightened, useful metal,<BR>
Surely Fire will not consume thee,<BR>
Will not burn his youngest brother,<BR>
Will not harm his nearest kindred.<BR>
Come thou to my room and furnace,<BR>
Where the fire is freely burning,<BR>
Thou wilt live, and grow, and prosper,<BR>
Wilt become the swords of heroes,<BR>
Buckles for the belts of women.'</P>
<P>"Ere arose the star of evening,<BR>
Iron ore had left the marshes,<BR>
From the water-beds had risen,<BR>
Had been carried to the furnace,<BR>
In the fire the smith had laid it,<BR>
Laid it in his smelting furnace.<BR>
Ilmarinen starts the bellows,<BR>
Gives three motions of the handle,<BR>
And the iron flows in streamlets<BR>
From the forge of the magician,<BR>
Soon becomes like baker's leaven,<BR>
Soft as dough for bread of barley.<BR>
Then out-screamed the metal, Iron:<BR>
'Wondrous blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Take, O take me from thy furnace,<BR>
From this fire and cruel torture.'</P>
<P>"Ilmarinen thus made answer:<BR>
'I will take thee from my furnace,<BR>
'Thou art but a little frightened,<BR>
Thou shalt be a mighty power,<BR>
Thou shalt slay the best of heroes,<BR>
Thou shalt wound thy dearest brother.'<BR>
"Straightway Iron made this promise,<BR>
Vowed and swore in strongest accents,<BR>
By the furnace, by the anvil,<BR>
By the tongs, and by the hammer,<BR>
These the words he vowed and uttered:<BR>
'Many trees that I shall injure,<BR>
Shall devour the hearts of mountains,<BR>
Shall not slay my nearest kindred,<BR>
Shall not kill the best of heroes,<BR>
Shall not wound my dearest brother;<BR>
Better live in civil freedom,<BR>
Happier would be my life-time,<BR>
Should I serve my fellow-beings,<BR>
Serve as tools for their convenience,<BR>
Than as implements of warfare,<BR>
Slay my friends and nearest. kindred,<BR>
Wound the children of my mother.'</P>
<P>"Now the master, Ilmarinen,<BR>
The renowned and skilful blacksmith,<BR>
From the fire removes the iron,<BR>
Places it upon the anvil,<BR>
Hammers well until it softens,<BR>
Hammers many fine utensils,<BR>
Hammers spears, and swords, and axes,<BR>
Hammers knives, and forks, and hatchets,<BR>
Hammers tools of all descriptions.</P>
<P>"Many things the blacksmith needed,<BR>
Many things he could not fashion,<BR>
Could not make the tongue of iron,<BR>
Could not hammer steel from iron,<BR>
Could not make the iron harden.<BR>
Well considered Ilmarinen,<BR>
Deeply thought and long reflected.<BR>
Then he gathered birchen ashes,<BR>
Steeped the ashes in the water,<BR>
Made a lye to harden iron,<BR>
Thus to form the steel most needful.<BR>
With his tongue he tests the mixture,<BR>
Weighs it long and well considers,<BR>
And the blacksmith speaks as follows:<BR>
'All this labor is for nothing,<BR>
Will not fashion steel from iron,<BR>
Will not make the soft ore harden.'</P>
<P>"Now a bee flies from the meadow,<BR>
Blue-wing coming from the flowers,<BR>
Flies about, then safely settles<BR>
Near the furnace of the smithy.</P>
<P>"'Thus the smith the bee addresses,<BR>
These the words of Ilmarinen:<BR>
'Little bee, thou tiny birdling,<BR>
Bring me honey on thy winglets,<BR>
On thy tongue, I pray thee, bring me<BR>
Sweetness from the fragrant meadows,<BR>
From the little cups of flowers,<BR>
From the tips of seven petals,<BR>
That we thus may aid the water<BR>
To produce the steel from iron.'</P>
<P>"Evil Hisi's bird, the hornet,<BR>
Heard these words of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Looking from the cottage gable,<BR>
Flying to the bark of birch-trees,<BR>
While the iron bars were heating<BR>
While the steel was being tempered;<BR>
Swiftly flew the stinging hornet,<BR>
Scattered all the Hisi horrors,<BR>
Brought the blessing of the serpent,<BR>
Brought the venom of the adder,<BR>
Brought the poison of the spider,<BR>
Brought the stings of all the insects,<BR>
Mixed them with the ore and water,<BR>
While the steel was being, tempered.</P>
<P>"Ilmarinen, skilful blacksmith,<BR>
First of all the iron-workers,<BR>
Thought the bee had surely brought him<BR>
Honey from the fragrant meadows,<BR>
From the little cups of flowers,<BR>
From the tips of seven petals,<BR>
And he spake the words that follow:<BR>
'Welcome, welcome, is thy coming,<BR>
Honeyed sweetness from the flowers<BR>
Thou hast brought to aid the water,<BR>
Thus to form the steel from iron!'</P>
<P>"Ilmarinen, ancient blacksmith,<BR>
Dipped the iron into water,<BR>
Water mixed with many poisons,<BR>
Thought it but the wild bee's honey;<BR>
Thus he formed the steel from iron.<BR>
When he plunged it into water,<BR>
Water mixed with many poisons,<BR>
When be placed it in the furnace,<BR>
Angry grew the hardened iron,<BR>
Broke the vow that he had taken,<BR>
Ate his words like dogs and devils,<BR>
Mercilessly cut his brother,<BR>
Madly raged against his kindred,<BR>
Caused the blood to flow in streamlets<BR>
From the wounds of man and hero.<BR>
This, the origin of iron,<BR>
And of steel of light blue color."</P>
<P>From the hearth arose the gray-beard,<BR>
Shook his heavy looks and answered:<BR>
"Now I know the source of iron,<BR>
Whence the steel and whence its evils;<BR>
Curses on thee, cruel iron,<BR>
Curses on the steel thou givest,<BR>
Curses on thee, tongue of evil,<BR>
Cursed be thy life forever!<BR>
Once thou wert of little value,<BR>
Having neither form nor beauty,<BR>
Neither strength nor great importance,<BR>
When in form of milk thou rested,<BR>
When for ages thou wert hidden<BR>
In the breasts of God's three daughters,<BR>
Hidden in their heaving bosoms,<BR>
On the borders of the cloudlets,<BR>
In the blue vault of the heavens.</P>
<P>"Thou wert once of little value,<BR>
Having neither form nor beauty,<BR>
Neither strength nor great importance,<BR>
When like water thou wert resting<BR>
On the broad back of the marshes,<BR>
On the steep declines of mountains,<BR>
When thou wert but formless matter,<BR>
Only dust of rusty color.</P>
<P>"Surely thou wert void of greatness,<BR>
Having neither strength nor beauty,<BR>
When the moose was trampling on thee,<BR>
When the roebuck trod upon thee,<BR>
When the tracks of wolves were in thee,<BR>
And the bear-paws scratched thy body.<BR>
Surely thou hadst little value<BR>
When the skilful Ilmarinen,<BR>
First of all the iron-workers,<BR>
Brought thee from the blackened swamp-lands,<BR>
Took thee to his ancient smithy,<BR>
Placed thee in his fiery furnace.<BR>
Truly thou hadst little vigor,<BR>
Little strength, and little danger,<BR>
When thou in the fire wert hissing,<BR>
Rolling forth like seething water,<BR>
From the furnace of the smithy,<BR>
When thou gavest oath the strongest,<BR>
By the furnace, by the anvil,<BR>
By the tongs, and by the hammer,<BR>
By the dwelling of the blacksmith,<BR>
By the fire within the furnace.</P>
<P>"Now forsooth thou hast grown mighty,<BR>
Thou canst rage in wildest fury;<BR>
Thou hast broken all thy pledges,<BR>
All thy solemn vows hast broken,<BR>
Like the dogs thou shamest honor,<BR>
Shamest both thyself and kindred,<BR>
Tainted all with breath of evil.<BR>
Tell who drove thee to this mischief,<BR>
Tell who taught thee all thy malice,<BR>
Tell who gavest thee thine evil!<BR>
Did thy father, or thy mother,<BR>
Did the eldest of thy brothers,<BR>
Did the youngest of thy sisters,<BR>
Did the worst of all thy kindred<BR>
Give to thee thine evil nature?<BR>
Not thy father, nor thy mother,<BR>
Not the eldest of thy brothers,<BR>
Not the youngest of thy sisters,<BR>
Not the worst of all thy kindred,<BR>
But thyself hast done this mischief,<BR>
Thou the cause of all our trouble.<BR>
Come and view thine evil doings,<BR>
And amend this flood of damage,<BR>
Ere I tell thy gray-haired mother,<BR>
Ere I tell thine aged father.<BR>
Great indeed a mother's anguish,<BR>
Great indeed a father's sorrow,<BR>
When a son does something evil,<BR>
When a child runs wild and lawless.</P>
<P>"Crimson streamlet, cease thy flowing<BR>
From the wounds of Wainamoinen;<BR>
Blood of ages, stop thy coursing<BR>
From the veins of the magician;<BR>
Stand like heaven's crystal pillars,<BR>
Stand like columns in the ocean,<BR>
Stand like birch-trees in the forest,<BR>
Like the tall reeds in the marshes,<BR>
Like the high-rocks on the sea-coast,<BR>
Stand by power of mighty magic!</P>
<P>"Should perforce thy will impel thee,<BR>
Flow thou on thine endless circuit,<BR>
Through the veins of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Through the bones, and through the muscles,<BR>
Through the lungs, and heart, and liver,<BR>
Of the mighty sage and singer;<BR>
Better be the food of heroes,<BR>
Than to waste thy strength and virtue<BR>
On the meadows and the woodlands,<BR>
And be lost in dust and ashes.<BR>
Flow forever in thy circle;<BR>
Thou must cease this crimson out-flow;<BR>
Stain no more the grass and flowers,<BR>
Stain no more these golden hill-tops,<BR>
Pride and beauty of our heroes.<BR>
In the veins of the magician,<BR>
In the heart of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Is thy rightful home and storehouse.<BR>
Thither now withdraw thy forces,<BR>
Thither hasten, swiftly flowing;<BR>
Flow no more as crimson currents,<BR>
Fill no longer crimson lakelets,<BR>
Must not rush like brooks in spring-tide,<BR>
Nor meander like the rivers.</P>
<P>"Cease thy flow, by word of magic,<BR>
Cease as did the falls of Tyrya,<BR>
As the rivers of Tuoni,<BR>
When the sky withheld her rain-drops,<BR>
When the sea gave up her waters,<BR>
In the famine of the seasons,<BR>
In the years of fire and torture.<BR>
If thou heedest not this order,<BR>
I shall offer other measures,<BR>
Know I well of other forces;<BR>
I shall call the Hisi irons,<BR>
In them I shall boil and roast thee,<BR>
Thus to check thy crimson flowing,<BR>
Thus to save the wounded hero.</P>
<P>"If these means be inefficient,<BR>
Should these measures prove unworthy,<BR>
I shall call omniscient Ukko,<BR>
Mightiest of the creators,<BR>
Stronger than all ancient heroes,<BR>
Wiser than the world-magicians;<BR>
He will check the crimson out-flow,<BR>
He will heal this wound of hatchet.</P>
<P>"Ukko, God of love and mercy,<BR>
God and Master Of the heavens,<BR>
Come thou hither, thou art needed,<BR>
Come thou quickly I beseech thee,<BR>
Lend thy hand to aid thy children,<BR>
Touch this wound with healing fingers,<BR>
Stop this hero's streaming life-blood,<BR>
Bind this wound with tender leaflets,<BR>
Mingle with them healing flowers,<BR>
Thus to check this crimson current,<BR>
Thus to save this great magician,<BR>
Save the life of Wainamoinen."</P>
<P>Thus at last the blood-stream ended,<BR>
As the magic words were spoken.<BR>
Then the gray-beard, much rejoicing,<BR>
Sent his young son to the smithy,<BR>
There to make a healing balsam,<BR>
From the herbs of tender fibre,<BR>
From the healing plants and flowers,<BR>
From the stalks secreting honey,<BR>
From the roots, and leaves, and blossoms.</P>
<P>On the way he meets an oak-tree,<BR>
And the oak the son addresses:<BR>
"Hast thou honey in thy branches,<BR>
Does thy sap run full of sweetness?"<BR>
Thus the oak-tree wisely answers:<BR>
"Yea, but last night dripped the honey<BR>
Down upon my spreading branches,<BR>
And the clouds their fragrance sifted,<BR>
Sifted honey on my leaflets,<BR>
From their home within the heavens."</P>
<P>Then the son takes oak-wood splinters,<BR>
Takes the youngest oak-tree branches,<BR>
Gathers many healing grasses,<BR>
Gathers many herbs and flowers,<BR>
Rarest herbs that grow in Northland,<BR>
Places them within the furnace<BR>
In a kettle made of copper;<BR>
Lets them steep and boil together,<BR>
Bits of bark chipped from the oak-tree,<BR>
Many herbs of healing virtues;<BR>
Steeps them one day, then a second,<BR>
Three long days of summer weather,<BR>
Days and nights in quick succession;<BR>
Then he tries his magic balsam,<BR>
Looks to see if it is ready,<BR>
If his remedy is finished;<BR>
But the balsam is unworthy.</P>
<P>Then he added other grasses,<BR>
Herbs of every healing virtue,<BR>
That were brought from distant nations,<BR>
Many hundred leagues from Northland,<BR>
Gathered by the wisest minstrels,<BR>
Thither brought by nine enchanters.<BR>
Three days more be steeped the balsam,<BR>
Three nights more the fire be tended,<BR>
Nine the days and nights be watched it,<BR>
Then again be tried the ointment,<BR>
Viewed it carefully and tested,<BR>
Found at last that it was ready,<BR>
Found the magic balm was finished.</P>
<P>Near by stood a branching birch-tree.<BR>
On the border of the meadow,<BR>
Wickedly it had been broken,<BR>
Broken down by evil Hisi;<BR>
Quick he takes his balm of healing,<BR>
And anoints the broken branches,<BR>
Rubs the balsam in the fractures,<BR>
Thus addresses then the birch-tree:<BR>
"With this balsam I anoint thee,<BR>
With this salve thy wounds I cover,<BR>
Cover well thine injured places;<BR>
Now the birch-tree shall recover,<BR>
Grow more beautiful than ever."</P>
<P>True, the birch-tree soon recovered,<BR>
Grew more beautiful than ever,<BR>
Grew more uniform its branches,<BR>
And its bole more strong and stately.<BR>
Thus it was be tried the balsam,<BR>
Thus the magic salve he tested,<BR>
Touched with it the splintered sandstone,<BR>
Touched the broken blocks of granite,<BR>
Touched the fissures in the mountains,<BR>
And the broken parts united,<BR>
All the fragments grew together.</P>
<P>Then the young boy quick returning<BR>
With the balsam he had finished,<BR>
To the gray-beard gave the ointment,<BR>
And the boy these measures uttered<BR>
"Here I bring the balm of healing,<BR>
Wonderful the salve I bring thee;<BR>
It will join the broken granite,<BR>
Make the fragments grow together,<BR>
Heat the fissures in the mountains,<BR>
And restore the injured birch-tree."</P>
<P>With his tongue the old man tested,<BR>
Tested thus the magic balsam,<BR>
Found the remedy effective,<BR>
Found the balm had magic virtues;<BR>
Then anointed he the minstrel,<BR>
Touched the wounds of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Touched them with his magic balsam,<BR>
With the balm of many virtues;<BR>
Speaking words of ancient wisdom,<BR>
These the words the gray-beard uttered:<BR>
"Do not walk in thine own virtue,<BR>
Do not work in thine own power,<BR>
Walk in strength of thy Creator;<BR>
Do not speak in thine own wisdom,<BR>
Speak with tongue of mighty Ukko.<BR>
In my mouth, if there be sweetness,<BR>
It has come from my Creator;<BR>
If my bands are filled with beauty,<BR>
All the beauty comes from Ukko."</P>
<P>When the wounds had been anointed,<BR>
When the magic salve had touched them,<BR>
Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Suffered fearful pain and anguish,<BR>
Sank upon the floor in torment,<BR>
Turning one way, then another,<BR>
Sought for rest and found it nowhere,<BR>
Till his pain the gray-beard banished,<BR>
Banished by the aid of magic,<BR>
Drove away his killing torment<BR>
To the court of all our trouble,<BR>
To the highest hill of torture,<BR>
To the distant rocks and ledges,<BR>
To the evil-bearing mountains,<BR>
To the realm of wicked Hisi.<BR>
Then be took some silken fabric,<BR>
Quick he tore the silk asunder,<BR>
Making equal strips for wrapping,<BR>
Tied the ends with silken ribbons,<BR>
Making thus a healing bandage;<BR>
Then he wrapped with skilful fingers<BR>
Wainamoinen's knee and ankle,<BR>
Wrapped the wounds of the magician,<BR>
And this prayer the gray-beard uttered<BR>
"Ukko's fabric is the bandage,<BR>
Ukko's science is the surgeon,<BR>
These have served the wounded hero,<BR>
Wrapped the wounds of the magician.<BR>
Look upon us, God of mercy,<BR>
Come and guard us, kind Creator,<BR>
And protect us from all evil!<BR>
Guide our feet lest they may stumble,<BR>
Guard our lives from every danger,<BR>
From the wicked wilds of Hisi."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Felt the mighty aid of magic,<BR>
Felt the help of gracious Ukko,<BR>
Straightway stronger grew in body,<BR>
Straightway were the wounds united,<BR>
Quick the fearful pain departed.<BR>
Strong and hardy grew the hero,<BR>
Straightway walked in perfect freedom,<BR>
Turned his knee in all directions,<BR>
Knowing neither pain nor trouble.</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Raised his eyes to high Jumala,<BR>
Looked with gratitude to heaven,<BR>
Looked on high, in joy and gladness,<BR>
Then addressed omniscient Ukko,<BR>
This the prayer the minstrel uttered:<BR>
"O be praised, thou God of mercy,<BR>
Let me praise thee, my Creator,<BR>
Since thou gavest me assistance,<BR>
And vouchsafed me thy protection,<BR>
Healed my wounds and stilled mine anguish,<BR>
Banished all my pain and trouble,<BR>
Caused by Iron and by Hisi.<BR>
O, ye people of Wainola,<BR>
People of this generation,<BR>
And the folk of future ages,<BR>
Fashion not in emulation,<BR>
River boat, nor ocean shallop,<BR>
Boasting of its fine appearance,<BR>
God alone can work completion,<BR>
Give to cause its perfect ending,<BR>
Never hand of man can find it,<BR>
Never can the hero give it,<BR>
Ukko is the only Master."</P>
