<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">KYLLIKKI'S BROKEN VOW.</H1>
<P>LEMMINKAINEN, artful husband,<BR>
Reckless hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Constantly beside his young wife.,<BR>
Passed his life in sweet contentment,<BR>
And the years rolled swiftly onward;<BR>
Ahti thought not of the battles,<BR>
Nor Kyllikki of the dances.</P>
<P>Once upon a time it happened<BR>
That the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Went upon the lake a-fishing,<BR>
Was not home at early evening,<BR>
As the cruel night descended;<BR>
To the village went Kyllikki,<BR>
To the dance of merry maidens.</P>
<P>Who will tell the evil story,<BR>
Who will bear the information<BR>
To the husband, Lemminkainen?<BR>
Ahti's sister tells the story,<BR>
And the sister's name, Ainikki.</P>
<P>Soon she spreads the cruel tidings,<BR>
Straightway gives the information,<BR>
Of Kyllikki's perjured honor,<BR>
These the words Ainikki utters:<BR>
"Ahti, my beloved brother,<BR>
To the village went Kyllikki,<BR>
To the hall of many strangers,<BR>
To the plays and village dances,<BR>
With the young men and the maidens,<BR>
With the maids of braided tresses,<BR>
To the halls of joy and pleasure."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, much dejected,<BR>
Broken-hearted, flushed with anger,<BR>
Spake these words in measured accents:<BR>
"Mother dear, my gray-haired mother,<BR>
Wilt thou straightway wash my linen<BR>
In the blood of poison-serpents,<BR>
In the black blood of the adder?<BR>
I must hasten to the combat,<BR>
To the camp-fires of the Northland,<BR>
To the battle-fields of Lapland;<BR>
To the village went Kyllikki,<BR>
To the play of merry maidens,<BR>
To the games and village dances,<BR>
With the maids of braided tresses."<BR>
Straightway speaks the wife, Kyllikki:<BR>
"My beloved husband, Ahti,<BR>
Do not go to war, I pray thee.<BR>
In the evening I lay sleeping,<BR>
Slumbering I saw in dream-land<BR>
Fire upshooting from the chimney,<BR>
Flames arising, mounting skyward,<BR>
From the windows of this dwelling,<BR>
From the summits of these rafters,<BR>
Piercing through our upper chambers,<BR>
Roaring like the fall of waters,<BR>
Leaping from the floor and ceiling,<BR>
Darting from the halls and doorways."</P>
<P>But the doubting Lemminkainen<BR>
Makes this answer to Kyllikki:<BR>
"I discredit dreams or women,<BR>
Have no faith in vows of maidens!<BR>
Faithful mother of my being,<BR>
Hither bring my mail of copper;<BR>
Strong desire is stirring in me<BR>
For the cup of deadly combat,<BR>
For the mead of martial conquest."<BR>
This the pleading mother's answer:<BR>
"Lemminkainen, son beloved,<BR>
Do not go to war I pray thee;<BR>
We have foaming beer abundant,<BR>
In our vessels beer of barley,<BR>
Held in casks by oaken spigots;<BR>
Drink this beer of peace and pleasure,<BR>
Let us drink of it together."<BR>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"I shall taste no more the viands,<BR>
In the home of false Kyllikki;<BR>
Rather would I drink the water<BR>
From the painted tips of birch-oars;<BR>
Sweeter far to me the water,<BR>
Than the beverage of dishonor,<BR>
At my mother's home and fireside!</P>
<P>"Hither bring my martial doublet,<BR>
Bring me now the sword of battle,<BR>
Bring my father's sword of honor;<BR>
I must go to upper Northland,<BR>
To the battle-fields of Lapland,<BR>
There to win me gold and silver."<BR>
This the anxious mother's answer:<BR>
"My beloved Kaukomieli,<BR>
We have gold in great abundance,<BR>
Gold and silver in the store-room;<BR>
Recently upon the uplands,<BR>
In the early hours of morning,<BR>
Toiled the workmen in the corn-fields,<BR>
Plowed the meadows filled with serpents,<BR>
When the plowshare raised the cover<BR>
From a chest of gold and silver,<BR>
Countless was the gold uncovered,<BR>
Hid beneath the grassy meadow;<BR>
This the treasure I have brought thee,<BR>
Take the countless gold in welcome."<BR>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Do not wish thy household silver,<BR>
From the wars I'll earn my silver;<BR>
Gold and silver from the combat<BR>
Are to me of greater value<BR>
Than the wealth thou hast discovered.<BR>
Bring me now my heavy armor,<BR>
Bring me too my spear and broadsword;<BR>
To the Northland I must hasten,<BR>
To the bloody wars of Lapland,<BR>
Thither does my pride impel me,<BR>
Thitherward my heart is turning.</P>
<P>"I have heard a tale of Lapland,<BR>
Some believe the wondrous story,<BR>
That a maid in Pimentola<BR>
Lives that does not care for suitors,<BR>
Does not care for bearded heroes."<BR>
This the aged mother's answer:<BR>
"Warlike Athi, son beloved,<BR>
In thy home thou hast Kyllikki,<BR>
Fairest wife of all the islands;<BR>
Strange to see two wives abiding<BR>
In the home of but one husband."<BR>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"To the village runs Kyllikki;<BR>
Let her run to village dances,<BR>
Let her sleep in other dwellings,<BR>
With the village youth find pleasure,<BR>
With the maids of braided tresses."</P>
<P>Seeks the mother to detain him,<BR>
Thus the anxious mother answers:<BR>
"Do not go, my son beloved,<BR>
Ignorant of Pohya-witchcraft,<BR>
To the distant homes of Northland<BR>
Till thou hast the art of magic,<BR>
Till thou hast some little wisdom<BR>
Do not go to fields of battle,<BR>
To the fires of Northland's children,<BR>
To the slaughter-fields of Lapland,<BR>
Till of magic thou art master.<BR>
There the Lapland maids will charm thee,<BR>
Turyalanders will bewitch thee,<BR>
Sing thy visage into charcoal,<BR>
Head and shoulders to the furnace,<BR>
Into ashes sing thy fore-arm,<BR>
Into fire direct thy footsteps."<BR>
Spake the warlike Lemminkainen:<BR>
Wizards often have bewitched me,<BR>
And the fascinating serpents;<BR>
Lapland wizards, three in number,<BR>
On an eve in time of summer,<BR>
Sitting on a rock at twilight,<BR>
Not a garment to protect them,<BR>
Once bewitched me with their magic;<BR>
This much they have taken from me,<BR>
This the sum of all my losses:<BR>
What the hatchet gains from flint-stone,<BR>
What the auger bores from granite,<BR>
What the heel chips from the iceberg,<BR>
And what death purloins from tomb-stones.</P>
<P>"Horribly the wizards threatened,<BR>
Tried to sink me with their magic,<BR>
In the water of the marshes,<BR>
In the mud and treacherous quicksand,<BR>
To my chin in mire and water;<BR>
But I too was born a hero,<BR>
Born a hero and magician,<BR>
Was not troubled by their magic.</P>
<P>"Straightway I began my singing,<BR>
Sang the archers with their arrows,<BR>
Sang the spearmen with their weapons,<BR>
Sang the swordsmen with their poniards,<BR>
Sang the singers with their singing,<BR>
The enchanters with their magic,<BR>
To the rapids of the rivers,<BR>
To the highest fall of waters,<BR>
To the all-devouring whirlpool,<BR>
To the deepest depths of ocean,<BR>
Where the wizards still are sleeping,<BR>
Sleeping till the grass shoots upward<BR>
Through the beards and wrinkled faces,<BR>
Through the locks of the enchanters,<BR>
As they sleep beneath the billows."</P>
<P>Still entreats the anxious mother,<BR>
Still beseeches Lemminkainen,<BR>
Trying to restrain the hero,<BR>
While Kyllikki begs forgiveness;<BR>
This the language of the mother:<BR>
"Do not go, my son beloved,<BR>
To the villages of Northland,<BR>
Nor to Lapland's frigid borders;<BR>
Dire misfortune will befall thee,<BR>
Star of evil settle o'er thee,<BR>
Lemminkainen's end, destruction.</P>
<P>"Couldst thou speak in tongues a hundred,<BR>
I could not believe thee able,<BR>
Through the magic of thy singing,<BR>
To enchant the sons of Lapland<BR>
To the bottom of the ocean,<BR>
Dost not know the Tury-language,<BR>
Canst but speak the tongue of Suomi,<BR>
Canst not win by witless magic."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, reckless hero,<BR>
Also known as Kaukomieli,<BR>
Stood beside his mother, combing<BR>
Out his sable locks and musing,<BR>
Brushing down his beard, debating,<BR>
Steadfast still in his decision,<BR>
Quickly hurls his brush in anger,<BR>
Hurls it to the wall opposing,<BR>
Gives his mother final answer,<BR>
These the words that Ahti uses:<BR>
"Dire misfortune will befall me,<BR>
Some sad fate will overtake me,<BR>
Evil come to Lemminkainen,<BR>
When the blood flows from that hair-brush,<BR>
When blood oozes from those bristles."</P>
<P>Thus the warlike Lemminkainen<BR>
Goes to never-pleasant Lapland,<BR>
Heeding not his mother's warning,<BR>
Heeding not her prohibition.<BR>
Thus the hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Quick equips himself for warfare,<BR>
On his head a copper helmet,<BR>
On his shoulders caps of copper,<BR>
On his body iron armor,<BR>
Steel, the belt around his body;<BR>
As he girds himself for battle,<BR>
Ahti thus soliloquizing:<BR>
"Strong the hero in his armor,<BR>
Strong indeed in copper helmet,<BR>
Powerful in mail of iron,<BR>
Stronger far than any hero<BR>
On the dismal shores of Lapland,<BR>
Need not fear their wise enchanters,<BR>
Need not fear their strongest foemen,<BR>
Need not fear a war with wizards."</P>
<P>Grasped he then the sword of battle,<BR>
Firmly grasped the heavy broadsword<BR>
That Tuoni had been grinding,<BR>
That the gods had brightly burnished,<BR>
Thrust it in the leathern scabbard,<BR>
Tied the scabbard to his armor.</P>
<P>How do heroes guard from danger,<BR>
Where protect themselves from evil?<BR>
Heroes guard their homes and firesides,<BR>
Guard their doors, and roofs, and windows,<BR>
Guard the posts that bold the torch-lights,<BR>
Guard the highways to the court-yard,<BR>
Guard the ends of all the gate-ways.<BR>
Heroes guard themselves from women,<BR>
Carefully from merry maidens;<BR>
If in this their strength be wanting,<BR>
Easy fall the heroes, victims<BR>
To the snares of the enchanters.<BR>
Furthermore are heroes watchful<BR>
Of the tribes of warlike giants,<BR>
Where the highway doubly branches,<BR>
On the borders of the blue-rock,<BR>
On the marshes filled with evil,<BR>
Near the mighty fall of waters,<BR>
Near the circling of the whirlpool,<BR>
Near the fiery springs and rapids.<BR>
Spake the stout-heart, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Rise ye heroes of the broadsword,<BR>
Ye, the earth's eternal heroes,<BR>
From the deeps, ye sickle-bearers,<BR>
From the brooks, ye crossbow-shooters,<BR>
Come, thou forest, with thine archers,<BR>
Come, ye thickets, with your armies,<BR>
Mountain spirits, with your powers,<BR>
Come, fell Hisi, with thy horrors,<BR>
Water-mother, with thy dangers,<BR>
Come, Wellamo, with thy mermaids,<BR>
Come, ye maidens from the valleys,<BR>
Come, ye nymphs from winding rivers,<BR>
Be protection to this hero,<BR>
Be his day-and-night companions,<BR>
Body-guard to Lemminkainen,<BR>
Thus to blunt the spears of wizards,<BR>
Thus to dull their pointed arrows,<BR>
That the spears of the enchanters,<BR>
That the arrows of the archers,<BR>
That the weapons of the foemen,<BR>
May not harm this bearded hero.</P>
<P>"Should this force be insufficient,<BR>
I can call on other powers,<BR>
I can call the gods above me,<BR>
Call the great god of the heavens,<BR>
Him who gives the clouds their courses,<BR>
Him who rules through boundless ether,<BR>
Who directs the march of storm-winds.</P>
<P>"Ukko, thou O God above me,<BR>
Thou the father of creation,<BR>
Thou that speakest through the thunder,<BR>
Thou whose weapon is the lightning,<BR>
Thou whose voice is borne by ether,<BR>
Grant me now thy mighty fire-sword,<BR>
Give me here thy burning arrows,<BR>
Lightning arrows for my quiver,<BR>
Thus protect me from all danger,<BR>
Guard me from the wiles of witches,<BR>
Guide my feet from every evil,<BR>
Help me conquer the enchanters,<BR>
Help me drive them from the Northland;<BR>
Those that stand in front of battle,<BR>
Those that fill the ranks behind me,<BR>
Those around me, those above me,<BR>
Those beneath me, help me banish,.<BR>
With their knives, and swords, and cross-bows,<BR>
With their spears of keenest temper,<BR>
With their tongues of evil magic;<BR>
Help me drive these Lapland wizards<BR>
To the deepest depths of ocean,<BR>
There to wrestle with Wellamo."</P>
<P>Then the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
Whistled loudly for his stallion,<BR>
Called the racer from the hurdles,<BR>
Called his brown steed from the pasture,<BR>
Threw the harness on the courser,<BR>
Hitched the fleet-foot to the snow-sledge,<BR>
Leaped upon the highest cross-bench,<BR>
Cracked his whip above the racer,<BR>
And the steed flies onward swiftly,<BR>
Bounds the sleigh upon its journey,<BR>
And the golden plain re-echoes;<BR>
Travels one day, then a second,<BR>
Travels all the next day northward,<BR>
Till the third day evening brings him<BR>
To a sorry Northland village,<BR>
On the dismal shores of Lapland.</P>
<P>Here the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Drove along the lowest highway,<BR>
Through the streets along the border,<BR>
To a court-yard in the hamlet,<BR>
Asked one standing in the doorway:<BR>
"Is there one within this dwelling,<BR>
That can loose my stallion's breastplate,<BR>
That can lift his heavy collar,<BR>
That these shafts can rightly lower?"</P>
<P>On the floor a babe was playing,<BR>
And the young child gave this answer:<BR>
"There is no one in this dwelling<BR>
That can loose thy stallion's breastplate,<BR>
That can lift his heavy collar,<BR>
That the shafts can rightly lower."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, not discouraged,<BR>
Whips his racer to a gallop,<BR>
Rushes forward through the village,<BR>
On the middle of the highways,<BR>
To the court-yard in the centre,<BR>
Asks one standing in the threshold,<BR>
Leaning on the penthouse door-posts:<BR>
"Is there any one here dwelling<BR>
That can slip my stallion's bridle,<BR>
That can loose his leathern breast-straps,<BR>
That can tend my royal racer?"</P>
<P>From the fire-place spake a wizard,<BR>
From her bench the witch made answer:<BR>
"Thou canst find one in this dwelling,<BR>
That can slip thy courser's bridle,<BR>
That can loose his heavy breastplate,<BR>
That can tend thy royal racer.<BR>
There are here a thousand heroes<BR>
That can make thee hasten homeward,<BR>
That can give thee fleet-foot stallions,<BR>
That can chase thee to thy country,<BR>
Reckless rascal and magician,<BR>
To thy home and fellow minstrels,<BR>
To the uplands of thy father,<BR>
To the cabins of thy mother,<BR>
To the work-bench of thy brother,<BR>
To the dairy or thy sister,<BR>
Ere the evening star has risen,<BR>
Ere the sun retires to slumber."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, little fearing,<BR>
Gives this answer to the wizard:<BR>
"I should slay thee for thy pertness,<BR>
That thy clatter might be silenced."</P>
<P>Then he whipped his fiery charger,<BR>
And the steed flew onward swiftly,<BR>
On the upper of the highways,<BR>
To the court-yard on the summit.<BR>
When the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
Had approached the upper court-yard,<BR>
Uttered he the words that follow:<BR>
"O thou Hisi, stuff this watch-dog,<BR>
Lempo, stuff his throat and nostrils,<BR>
Close the mouth of this wild barker,<BR>
Bridle well the vicious canine,<BR>
That the watcher may be silent<BR>
While the hero passes by him."</P>
<P>Then he stepped within the court-room,<BR>
With his whip he struck the flooring,<BR>
From the floor arose a vapor,<BR>
In the fog appeared a pigmy,<BR>
Who unhitched the royal racer,<BR>
From his back removed the harness,<BR>
Gave the weary steed attention.<BR>
Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Carefully advanced and listened.<BR>
No one saw the strange magician,<BR>
No one heard his cautious footsteps;<BR>
Heard he songs within the dwelling,<BR>
Through the moss-stuffed chinks heard voices.<BR>
Through the walls he beard them singing,<BR>
Through the doors the peals of laughter.</P>
<P>Then he spied within the court-rooms,<BR>
Lurking slyly in the hall-ways,<BR>
Found the court-rooms filled with singers,<BR>
By the walls were players seated,<BR>
Near the doors the wise men hovered,<BR>
Skilful ones upon the benches,<BR>
Near the fires the wicked wizards;<BR>
All were singing songs of Lapland,<BR>
Singing songs of evil Hisi.</P>
<P>Now the minstrel, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Changes both his form and stature,<BR>
Passes through the inner door-ways,<BR>
Enters he the spacious court-hall,<BR>
And these words the hero utters:<BR>
"Fine the singing quickly ending,<BR>
Good the song that quickly ceases;<BR>
Better far to keep thy wisdom<BR>
Than to sing it on the house-tops."</P>
<P>Comes the hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Fleetly rushing through the door-way,<BR>
To the centre of the court-room,<BR>
And addresses thus the stranger:<BR>
Formerly a dog lay watching,<BR>
Was a cur of iron-color,<BR>
Fond of flesh, a bone-devourer,<BR>
Loved to lick the blood of strangers.<BR>
Who then art thou of the heroes,<BR>
Who of all the host of heroes,<BR>
That thou art within my court-rooms,<BR>
That thou comest to my dwelling,<BR>
Was not seen without my portals,<BR>
Was not scented by my watch-dogs?<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Do not think that I come hither<BR>
Having neither wit nor wisdom,<BR>
Having neither art nor power,<BR>
Wanting in ancestral knowledge,<BR>
Lacking prudence of the fathers,<BR>
That thy watch-dogs may devour me.</P>
<P>"My devoted mother washed me,<BR>
When a frail and tender baby,<BR>
Three times in the nights of summer,<BR>
Nine times in the nights of autumn,<BR>
That upon my journeys northward<BR>
I might sing the ancient wisdom,<BR>
Thus protect myself from danger;<BR>
When at home I sing as wisely<BR>
As the minstrels of thy hamlet."</P>
<P>Then the singer, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Ancient hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Quick began his incantations,<BR>
Straightway sang the songs of witchcraft,<BR>
From his fur-robe darts the lightning,<BR>
Flames outshooting from his eye-balls,<BR>
From the magic of his singing<BR>
From his wonderful enchantment.<BR>
Sang the very best of singers<BR>
To the very worst of minstrels,<BR>
Filled their mouths with dust and ashes,<BR>
Piled the rocks upon their shoulders,<BR>
Stilled the best of Lapland witches,<BR>
Stilled the sorcerers and wizards.<BR>
Then he banished all their heroes,<BR>
Banished all their proudest minstrels,<BR>
This one hither, that one thither,<BR>
To the lowlands poor in verdure,<BR>
To the unproductive uplands,<BR>
To the oceans wanting whiting,<BR>
To the waterfalls of Rutya,<BR>
To the whirlpool hot and flaming,<BR>
To the waters decked with sea-foam,<BR>
Into fires and boiling waters,<BR>
Into everlasting torment.</P>
<P>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Sang the foemen with their broadswords?<BR>
Sang the heroes with their weapons,<BR>
Sang the eldest, sang the youngest,<BR>
Sang the middle-aged, enchanted;<BR>
Only one he left his senses,<BR>
He a poor, defenseless shepherd,<BR>
Old and sightless, halt and wretched,<BR>
And the old man's name was Nasshut.<BR>
Spake the miserable shepherd:<BR>
"Thou hast old and young enchanted,<BR>
Thou hast banished all our heroes,<BR>
Why hast spared this wretched shepherd?"<BR>
This is Lemminkainen's answer:<BR>
"Therefore have I not bewitched thee:<BR>
Thou art old, and blind, and wretched<BR>
Feeble-minded thou, and harmless,<BR>
Loathsome now without my magic.<BR>
Thou didst, in thy better life-time,<BR>
When a shepherd filled with malice,<BR>
Ruin all thy mother's berries,<BR>
Make thy sister, too unworthy,<BR>
Ruin all thy brother's cattle,<BR>
Drive to death thy father's stallions,<BR>
Through the marshes, o'er the meadows,<BR>
Through the lowlands, o'er the mountains,<BR>
Heeding not thy mother's counsel."</P>
<P>Thereupon the wretched Nasshut,<BR>
Angry grew and swore for vengeance,<BR>
Straightway limping through the door-way,<BR>
Hobbled on beyond the court-yard,<BR>
O'er the meadow-lands and pastures,<BR>
To the river of the death-land,<BR>
To the holy stream and whirlpool,<BR>
To the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
To the islands of Manala;<BR>
Waited there for Kaukomieli,<BR>
Listened long for Lemminkainen,<BR>
Thinking he must pass this river<BR>
On his journey to his country,<BR>
On. the highway to the islands,<BR>
From the upper shores of Pohya,<BR>
From the dreary Sariola.</P>
