<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">CAPTURE OF THE FIRE-FISH.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, the enchanter,<BR>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<BR>
Long reflected, well considered,<BR>
How to weave the net of flax-yarn,<BR>
Weave the fish-net of the fathers.<BR>
Spake the minstrel of Wainola:<BR>
"Who will plow the field and fallow,<BR>
Sow the flax, and spin the flax-threads,<BR>
That I may prepare the fish-net,<BR>
Wherewith I may catch the Fire-pike,<BR>
May secure the thing of evil?"</P>
<P>Soon they found a fertile island,<BR>
Found the fallow soil befitting,<BR>
On the border of the heather,<BR>
And between two stately oak-trees.<BR>
They prepared the soil for sowing.<BR>
Searching everywhere for flax-seed,<BR>
Found it in Tuoni's kingdom,<BR>
In the keeping of an insect.<BR>
Then they found a pile of ashes,<BR>
Where the fire had burned a vessel;<BR>
In the ashes sowed the seedlings<BR>
Near the Alue-lake and border,<BR>
In the rich and loamy fallow.<BR>
There the seed took root and flourished,<BR>
Quickly grew to great proportions,<BR>
In a single night in summer.<BR>
Thus the flax was sowed at evening,<BR>
Placed within the earth by moonlight;<BR>
Quick it grew, and quickly ripened,<BR>
Quick Wainola's heroes pulled it,<BR>
Quick they broke it on the hackles,<BR>
Hastened with it to the waters,<BR>
Dipped it in the lake and washed it;<BR>
Quickly brought it borne and dried it.<BR>
Quickly broke, and combed, and smoothed it,<BR>
Brushed it well at early morning,<BR>
Laid it into laps for spinning<BR>
Quick the maidens twirl the spindles,<BR>
Spin the flaxen threads for weaving,<BR>
In a single night in summer.<BR>
Quick the sisters wind and reel it,<BR>
Make it ready for the needle.<BR>
Brothers weave it into fish-nets,<BR>
And the fathers twist the cordage,<BR>
While the mothers knit the meshes,<BR>
Rapidly the mesh-stick circles;<BR>
Soon the fish-net is completed,<BR>
In a single night in summer.<BR>
As the magic net is finished,<BR>
And in length a hundred fathoms,<BR>
On the rim three hundred fathoms.<BR>
Rounded stones are fastened to it,<BR>
Joined thereto are seven float-boards.</P>
<P>Now the young men take the fish-net,<BR>
And the old men cheer them onward,<BR>
Wish them good-luck at their fishing.<BR>
Long they row and drag the flax-seine,<BR>
Here and there the net is lowered;<BR>
Now they drag it lengthwise, sidewise,<BR>
Drag it through the slimy reed-beds;<BR>
But they do not catch the Fire-pike,<BR>
Only smelts, and luckless red-fish,<BR>
Little fish of little value.<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Let us go ourselves a-fishing,<BR>
Let us catch the fish of evil!"</P>
<P>To the fishing went the brothers,<BR>
Magic heroes of the Northland,<BR>
Pulled the fish-net through the waters,<BR>
Toward an island in the deep-sea<BR>
Then they turn and drag the fish-net<BR>
Toward a meadow jutting seaward;<BR>
Now they drag it toward Wainola,<BR>
Draw it lengthwise, sidewise, crosswise,<BR>
Catching fish of every species,<BR>
salmon, trout, and pike, and whiting,<BR>
Do not catch the evil Fire-fish.</P>
<P>Then the master, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Made additions to its borders,<BR>
Made it many fathoms wider,<BR>
And a hundred fathoms longer,<BR>
Then these words the hero uttered<BR>
"Famous blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Let us go again a-fishing,<BR>
Row again the magic fish-net,<BR>
Drag it well through all the waters,<BR>
That we may obtain the Fire-pike!"</P>
<P>Thereupon the Northland heroes<BR>
Go a second time a-fishing,<BR>
Drag their nets across the rivers,<BR>
Lakelets, seas, and bays, and inlets,<BR>
Catching fish of many species,<BR>
But the Fire-fish is not taken.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient singer,<BR>
Long reflecting, spake these measures:<BR>
"Dear Wellamo, water-hostess,<BR>
Ancient mother with the reed-breast,<BR>
Come, exchange thy water-raiment,<BR>
Change thy coat of reeds and rushes<BR>
For the garments I shall give thee,<BR>
Light sea-foam, thine inner vesture,<BR>
And thine outer, moss and sea-grass,<BR>
Fashioned by the wind's fair daughters,<BR>
Woven by the flood's sweet maidens;<BR>
I will give thee linen vestments<BR>
Spun from flax of softest fiber,<BR>
Woven by the Moon's white virgins,<BR>
Fashioned by the Sun's bright daughters<BR>
Fitting raiment for Wellamo!</P>
<P>"Ahto, king of all the waters,<BR>
Ruler of a thousand grottoes,<BR>
Take a pole of seven fathoms,<BR>
Search with this the deepest waters,<BR>
Rummage well the lowest bottoms;<BR>
Stir up all the reeds and sea-weeds,<BR>
Hither drive a school of gray-pike,<BR>
Drive them to our magic fish-net,<BR>
From the haunts in pike abounding,<BR>
From the caverns, and the trout-holes,<BR>
From the whirlpools of the deep-sea,<BR>
From the bottomless abysses,<BR>
Where the sunshine never enters,<BR>
Where the moonlight never visits,<BR>
And the sands are never troubled."</P>
<P>Rose a pigmy from the waters,<BR>
From the floods a little hero,<BR>
Riding on a rolling billow,<BR>
And the pigmy spake these measures:<BR>
"Dost thou wish a worthy helper,<BR>
One to use the pole and frighten<BR>
Pike and salmon to thy fish-nets?"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<BR>
Answered thus the lake-born hero:<BR>
"Yea, we need a worthy helper,<BR>
One to hold the pole, and frighten<BR>
Pike and salmon to our fish-nets."</P>
<P>Thereupon the water-pigmy<BR>
Cut a linden from the border,<BR>
Spake these words to Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Shall I scare with all my powers,<BR>
With the forces of my being,<BR>
As thou needest shall I scare them?"<BR>
Spake the minstrel, Wainamoinen:<BR>
"If thou scarest as is needed,<BR>
Thou wilt scare with all thy forces,<BR>
With the strength of thy dominions."</P>
<P>Then began the pigmy-hero,<BR>
To affright the deep-sea-dwellers;<BR>
Drove the fish in countless numbers<BR>
To the net of the magicians.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Drew his net along the waters,<BR>
Drew it with his ropes of flax-thread,<BR>
Spake these words of magic import:<BR>
"Come ye fish of Northland waters<BR>
To the regions of my fish-net,<BR>
As my hundred meshes lower."</P>
<P>Then the net was drawn and fastened,<BR>
Many were the gray-pike taken<BR>
By he master and magician.<BR>
Wainamoinen, happy-hearted,<BR>
Hastened to a neighboring island,<BR>
To a blue-point in the waters,<BR>
Near a red-bridge on the headland;<BR>
Landed there his draught of fishes,<BR>
Cast the pike upon the sea-shore,<BR>
And the Fire-pike was among them,<BR>
Cast the others to the waters.<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"May I touch thee with my fingers,<BR>
Using not my gloves of iron,<BR>
Using not my blue-stone mittens?<BR>
This the Sun-child hears and answers:<BR>
"I should like to carve the Fire-fish,<BR>
I should like this pike to handle,<BR>
If I had the knife of good-luck."</P>
<P>Quick a knife falls from the heavens,<BR>
From the clouds a magic fish-knife,<BR>
Silver-edged and golden-headed,<BR>
To the girdle of the Sun-child;<BR>
Quick he grasps the copper handle,<BR>
Quick the hero carves the Fire-pike,<BR>
Finds therein the tortured lake-trout;<BR>
Carves the lake-trout thus discovered.<BR>
Finds therein the fated whiting;<BR>
Carves the whiting, finds a blue-ball<BR>
In the third cave of his body.<BR>
He, the blue-ball quick unwinding,<BR>
Finds within a ball of scarlet;<BR>
Carefully removes the cover,<BR>
Finds the ball of fire within it,<BR>
Finds the flame from heaven fallen,<BR>
From the heights of the seventh heaven,<BR>
Through nine regions of the ether.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen long reflected<BR>
How to get the magic fire-ball<BR>
To Wainola's fireless hearth-stones,<BR>
To his cold and cheerless dwellings.<BR>
Quick he snatched the fire of heaven<BR>
From the fingers of the Sun-child.<BR>
Wainamoinen's beard it singes,<BR>
Burns the brow of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Burns the fingers of the blacksmith.<BR>
Rolling forth it hastens westward,<BR>
Hastens to the Alue shore-lines,<BR>
Burns the juniper and alder,<BR>
Burns the and heath and meadow,<BR>
Rises to the lofty linden,<BR>
Burns the firs upon the mountains;<BR>
Hastens onward, onward, onward,<BR>
Burns the islands of the Northland,<BR>
Burns the Sawa fields and forests,<BR>
Burns the dry lands of Karyala.</P>
<P>Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Hastens through the fields and fenlands,<BR>
Tracks the ranger to the glen-wood,<BR>
Finds the Fire-child in an elm-tree,<BR>
Sleeping in a bed of fungus.</P>
<P>Thereupon wise Wainamoinen<BR>
Wakes the child and speaks these measures:<BR>
"Wicked fire that God created,<BR>
Flame of Ukko from the heavens,<BR>
Thou hast gone in vain to sea-caves,<BR>
To the lakes without a reason;<BR>
Better go thou to my village,<BR>
To the hearth-stones of my people;<BR>
Hide thyself within my chimneys,<BR>
In mine ashes sleep and linger.<BR>
In the day-time I will use thee<BR>
To devour the blocks of birch-wood;<BR>
In the evening I will hide thee<BR>
Underneath the golden circle."</P>
<P>Then he took the willing Panu,<BR>
Took the willing fire of Ukko,<BR>
Laid it in a box of tinder,<BR>
In the punk-wood of a birch-tree,<BR>
In a vessel forged from copper;<BR>
Carried it with care and pleasure<BR>
To the fog-point in the waters,<BR>
To the island forest covered.<BR>
Thus returned the fire to Northland,<BR>
To the chambers of Wainola,<BR>
To the hearths of Kalevala.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, famous blacksmith,<BR>
Hastened to the deep-sea's margin,<BR>
Sat upon the rock of torture,<BR>
Feeling pain the flame had given,<BR>
Laved his wounds with briny water,<BR>
Thus to still the Fire-child's fury,<BR>
Thus to end his persecutions.</P>
<P>Long reflecting, Ilmarinen<BR>
Thus addressed the flame of Ukko:<BR>
"Evil Panu from the, heavens,<BR>
Wicked son of God from ether,<BR>
Tell me what has made thee angry,<BR>
Made thee burn my weary members,<BR>
Burn my beard, and face, and fingers,<BR>
Made me suffer death-land tortures?<BR>
Spake again young Ilmarinen:<BR>
"How can I wild Panu conquer,<BR>
How shall I control his conduct,<BR>
Make him end his evil doings?<BR>
Come, thou daughter from Pohyola,<BR>
Come, white virgin of the hoar-frost,<BR>
Come on shoes of ice from Lapland,<BR>
Icicles upon thy garments,<BR>
In one band a cup of white-frost,<BR>
In the other hand an ice-spoon;<BR>
Sprinkle snow upon my members,<BR>
Where the Fire-child has been resting,<BR>
Let the hoar-frost fall and settle.</P>
<P>"Should this prayer be unavailing,<BR>
Come, thou son of Sariola,<BR>
Come, thou child of Frost from Pohya,<BR>
Come, thou Long-man from the ice-plains,<BR>
Of the height of stately pine-trees,<BR>
Slender as the trunks of lindens,<BR>
On thy hands the gloves of Hoar-frost,<BR>
Cap of ice upon thy forehead,<BR>
On thy waist a white-frost girdle;<BR>
Bring the ice-dust from Pohyola,<BR>
From the cold and sunless village.<BR>
Rain is crystallized in Northland,<BR>
Ice in Pohya is abundant,<BR>
Lakes of ice and ice-bound rivers,<BR>
Frozen smooth, the sea of ether.<BR>
Bounds the hare in frosted fur-robe,<BR>
Climbs the bear in icy raiment,<BR>
Ambles o'er the snowy mountains.<BR>
Swans of frost descend the rivers,<BR>
Ducks of ice in countless numbers<BR>
Swim upon thy freezing waters,<BR>
Near the cataract and whirlpool.<BR>
Bring me frost upon thy snow-sledge,<BR>
Snow and ice in great abundance,<BR>
From the summit of the wild-top,<BR>
From the borders of the mountains.<BR>
With thine ice, and snow, and hoar-frost<BR>
Cover well mine injured members<BR>
Where wild Panu has been resting,<BR>
Where the child of Fire has lingered.</P>
<P>"Should this call be ineffective,<BR>
Ukko, God of love and mercy,<BR>
First and last of the creators,<BR>
From the east send forth a snow-cloud,<BR>
From the west despatch a second,<BR>
Join their edges well together,<BR>
Let there be no vacant places,<BR>
Let these clouds bring snow and<BR>
Lay the healing balm of Ukko<BR>
On my burning, tortured tissues,<BR>
Where wild Panu has been resting."<BR>
Thus the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Stills the pains by fire engendered,<BR>
Stills the agonies and tortures<BR>
Brought him by the child of evil,<BR>
Brought him by the wicked Panu.</P>
