<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">CAPTURE OF THE SAMPO.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, old and truthful,<BR>
With the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
With the reckless son of Lempo,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
On the sea's smooth plain departed,<BR>
On the far-extending waters,<BR>
To the village, cold and dreary,<BR>
To the never-pleasant Northland,<BR>
Where the heroes fall and perish.<BR>
Ilmarinen led the rowers<BR>
On one side the magic war-ship,<BR>
And the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
Led the rowers on the other.<BR>
Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
Laid his hand upon the rudder,<BR>
Steered his vessel o'er the waters,<BR>
Through the foam and angry billows<BR>
To Pohyola's place of landing,<BR>
To the cylinders of copper,<BR>
Where the war-ships lie at anchor.</P>
<P>When they had arrived at Pohya,<BR>
When their journey they had ended,<BR>
On the land they rolled their vessel,<BR>
On the copper-banded rollers,<BR>
Straightway journeyed to the village,<BR>
Hastened to the halls and hamlets<BR>
Of the dismal Sariola.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Thus addressed the stranger-heroes:<BR>
Magic heroes of Wainola,<BR>
What the tidings ye are bringing<BR>
To the people of my village?"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel.<BR>
Gave this answer to the hostess:<BR>
"All the hosts of Kalevala<BR>
Are inquiring for the Sampo,<BR>
Asking for the lid in colors;<BR>
Hither have these heroes journeyed<BR>
To divide the priceless treasure.<BR>
Thus the hostess spake in answer:<BR>
"No one would divide a partridge,<BR>
Nor a squirrel, with three heroes;<BR>
Wonderful the magic Sampo,<BR>
Plenty does it bring to Northland;<BR>
And the colored lid re-echoes<BR>
From the copper-bearing mountains,<BR>
From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<BR>
To the joy of its possessors."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:<BR>
"If thou wilt not share the Sampo,<BR>
Give to us an equal portion,<BR>
We will take it to Wainola,<BR>
With its lid of many colors,<BR>
Take by force the hope of Pohya."</P>
<P>Thereupon the Northland hostess<BR>
Angry grew and sighed for vengeance;<BR>
Called her people into council,<BR>
Called the hosts of Sariola,<BR>
Heroes with their trusted broadswords,<BR>
To destroy old Wainamoinen<BR>
With his people of the Northland.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<BR>
Hastened to his harp of fish-bone,<BR>
And began his magic playing;<BR>
All of Pohya stopped and listened,<BR>
Every warrior was silenced<BR>
By the notes of the magician;<BR>
Peaceful-minded grew the soldiers,<BR>
All the maidens danced with pleasure,<BR>
While the heroes fell to weeping,<BR>
And the young men looked in wonder.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen plays unceasing,<BR>
Plays the maidens into slumber,<BR>
Plays to sleep the young and aged,<BR>
All of Northland sleeps and listens.<BR>
Wise and wondrous Wainamoinen,<BR>
The eternal bard and singer,<BR>
Searches in his pouch of leather,<BR>
Draws therefrom his slumber-arrows,<BR>
Locks the eyelids of the sleepers,<BR>
Of the heroes of Pohyola,<BR>
Sings and charms to deeper slumber<BR>
All the warriors of the Northland.<BR>
Then the heroes of Wainola<BR>
Hasten to obtain the Sampo,<BR>
To procure the lid in colors<BR>
From the copper-bearing mountains.<BR>
From behind nine locks of copper,<BR>
In the stone-berg of Pohyola.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Then began his wondrous singing,<BR>
Sang in gentle tones of magic,<BR>
At the entrance to the mountain,<BR>
At the border of the stronghold;<BR>
Trembled all the rocky portals,<BR>
And the iron-banded pillars<BR>
Fell and crumbled at his singing.</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, magic blacksmith,<BR>
Well anointed all the hinges,<BR>
All the bars and locks anointed,<BR>
And the bolts flew back by magic,<BR>
All the gates unlocked in silence,<BR>
Opened for the great magician.<BR>
Spake the minstrel Wainamoinen:<BR>
"O thou daring Lemminkainen,<BR>
Friend of mine in times of trouble,<BR>
Enter thou within the mountain,<BR>
Bring away the wondrous Sampo,<BR>
Bring away the lid in colors!"</P>
<P>Quick the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Ever ready for a venture,<BR>
Hastens to the mountain-caverns,<BR>
There to find the famous Sampo,<BR>
There to get the lid in colors;<BR>
Strides along with conscious footsteps,<BR>
Thus himself he vainly praises:<BR>
"Great am I and full of glory,<BR>
Wonder-hero, son of Ukko,<BR>
I will bring away the Sampo,<BR>
Turn about the lid in colors,<BR>
Turn it on its magic hinges!"</P>
<P>Lemminkainen finds the wonder,<BR>
Finds the Sampo in the mountain,<BR>
Labors long with strength heroic,<BR>
Tugs with might and main to turn it;<BR>
Motionless remains the treasure,<BR>
Deeper sinks the lid in colors,<BR>
For the roots have grown about it,<BR>
Grown nine fathoms deep in sand-earth.</P>
<P>Lived a mighty ox in Northland,<BR>
Powerful in bone and sinew,<BR>
Beautiful in form and color,<BR>
Horns the length of seven fathoms,<BR>
Mouth and eyes of wondrous beauty.</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, reckless hero,<BR>
Harnesses the ox in pasture,<BR>
Takes the master-plow of Pohya,<BR>
Plows the roots about the Sampo,<BR>
Plows around the lid in colors,<BR>
And the sacred Sampo loosens,<BR>
Falls the colored lid in silence.<BR>
Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Brings the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Brings the daring Lemminkainen,<BR>
Lastly brings the magic Sampo,<BR>
From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<BR>
From the copper-bearing mountain,<BR>
Hides it in his waiting vessel,<BR>
In the war-ship of Wainola.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen called his people,<BR>
Called his crew of men and maidens,<BR>
Called together all his heroes,<BR>
Rolled his vessel to the water,<BR>
Into billowy deeps and dangers.<BR>
Spake the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Whither shall we take the Sampo,<BR>
Whither take the lid in colors,<BR>
From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<BR>
From this evil spot of Northland?"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, wise and faithful,<BR>
Gave this answer to the question:<BR>
"Thither shall we take the Sampo,<BR>
Thither take the lid in colors,<BR>
To the fog-point on the waters,<BR>
To the island forest-covered;<BR>
There the treasure may be hidden,<BR>
May remain in peace for ages,<BR>
Free from trouble, free from danger,<BR>
Where the sword will not molest it."</P>
<P>Then the minstrel, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Joyful, left the Pohya borders,<BR>
Homeward sailed, and happy-hearted,<BR>
Spake these measures on departing:<BR>
"Turn, O man-of-war, from Pohya,<BR>
Turn thy back upon the strangers,<BR>
Turn thou to my distant country!<BR>
Rock, O winds, my magic vessel,<BR>
Homeward drive my ship, O billows,<BR>
Lend the rowers your assistance,<BR>
Give the oarsmen easy labor,<BR>
On this vast expanse of waters!<BR>
Give me of thine oars, O Ahto,<BR>
Lend thine aid, O King of sea-waves,<BR>
Guide as with thy helm in safety,<BR>
Lay thy hand upon the rudder,<BR>
And direct our war-ship homeward;<BR>
Let the hooks of metal rattle<BR>
O'er the surging of the billows,<BR>
On the white-capped waves' commotion."</P>
<P>Then the master, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Guided home his willing vessel;<BR>
And the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
With the lively Lemminkainen,<BR>
Led the mighty host of rowers,<BR>
And the war-ship glided homeward<BR>
O'er the sea's unruffled surface,<BR>
O'er the mighty waste of waters.<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Once before I rode these billows,<BR>
There were viands for the heroes,<BR>
There was singing for the maidens;<BR>
But to-day I hear no singing,<BR>
Hear no songs upon the vessel,<BR>
Hear no music on the waters."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<BR>
Answered thus wild Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Let none sing upon the blue-sea,<BR>
On the waters, no rejoicing;<BR>
Singing would prolong our journey,<BR>
Songs disturb the host of rowers;<BR>
Soon will die the silver sunlight,<BR>
Darkness soon will overtake us,<BR>
On this evil waste of waters,<BR>
On this blue-sea, smooth and level."<BR>
These the words of Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Time will fly on equal pinions<BR>
Whether we have songs or silence;<BR>
Soon will disappear the daylight,<BR>
And the night as quickly follow,<BR>
Whether we be sad or joyous."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
O'er the blue backs of the billows,<BR>
Steered one day, and then a second,<BR>
Steered the third from morn till even,<BR>
When the wizard, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Once again addressed the master:<BR>
"Why wilt thou, O famous minstrel,<BR>
Sing no longer for thy people,<BR>
Since the Sampo thou hast captured,<BR>
Captured too the lid in colors?"<BR>
These the words of Wainamoinen:<BR>
"'Tis not well to sing too early!<BR>
Time enough for songs of joyance<BR>
When we see our home-land mansions,<BR>
When our journeyings have ended!"<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"At the helm, if I were sitting,<BR>
I would sing at morn and evening,<BR>
Though my voice has little sweetness;<BR>
Since thy songs are not forthcoming<BR>
Listen to my wondrous singing!"</P>
<P>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Raised his voice above the waters,<BR>
O'er the sea his song resounded;<BR>
But his measures were discordant,<BR>
And his notes were harsh and frightful.<BR>
Sang the wizard, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Screeched the reckless Kaukomieli,<BR>
Till the mighty war-ship trembled;<BR>
Far and wide was heard his singing,<BR>
Heard his songs upon the waters,<BR>
Heard within the seventh village,<BR>
Heard beyond the seven oceans.</P>
<P>Sat a crane within the rushes,<BR>
On a hillock clothed in verdure,<BR>
And the crane his toes was counting;<BR>
Suddenly he heard the singing<BR>
Of the wizard, Lemminkainen;<BR>
And the bird was justly frightened<BR>
At the songs of the magician.<BR>
Then with horrid voice, and screeching,<BR>
Flew the crane across the broad-sea<BR>
To the lakes of Sariola,<BR>
O'er Pohyola's hills and hamlets,<BR>
Screeching, screaming, over Northland,<BR>
Till the people of the darkness<BR>
Were awakened from their slumbers.</P>
<P>Louhi hastens to her hurdles,<BR>
Hastens to her droves of cattle,<BR>
Hastens also to her garners,<BR>
Counts her herds, inspects her store-house;<BR>
Undisturbed she finds her treasures.</P>
<P>Quick she journeys to the entrance<BR>
To the copper-bearing mountain,<BR>
Speaks these words as she approaches:<BR>
"Woe is me, my life hard-fated,<BR>
Woe to Louhi, broken-hearted!<BR>
Here the tracks of the destroyers,<BR>
All my locks and bolts are broken<BR>
By the hands of cruel strangers!<BR>
Broken are my iron hinges,<BR>
Open stand the mountain-portals<BR>
Leading to the Northland-treasure.<BR>
Has Pohyola lost her Sampo?"</P>
<P>Then she hastened to the chambers<BR>
Where the Sampo had been grinding;<BR>
But she found the chambers empty,<BR>
Lid and Sampo gone to others,<BR>
From the stone-berg of Pohyola,<BR>
From behind nine locks of copper,<BR>
In the copper-bearing mountain.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Angry grew and cried for vengeance;<BR>
As she found her fame departing,<BR>
Found her-strength fast disappearing,<BR>
Thus addressed the sea-fog virgin:<BR>
"Daughter of the morning-vapors,<BR>
Sift thy fogs from distant cloud-land,<BR>
Sift the thick air from the heavens,<BR>
Sift thy vapors from the ether,<BR>
On the blue-back of the broad-sea,<BR>
On the far extending waters,<BR>
That the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Friend of ocean-wave and billow,<BR>
May not baffle his pursuers!</P>
<P>"Should this prayer prove unavailing,<BR>
Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,<BR>
Raise thy head above the billows,<BR>
And destroy Wainola's heroes,<BR>
Sink them to thy deep sea-castles,<BR>
There devour them at thy pleasure;<BR>
Bring thou back the golden Sampo<BR>
To the people of Pohyola!</P>
<P>"Should these words be ineffective,<BR>
Ukko, mightiest of rulers,<BR>
Golden king beyond the welkin,<BR>
Sitting on a throne of silver,<BR>
Fill thy skies with heavy storm-clouds,<BR>
Call thy fleetest winds about thee,<BR>
Send them o'er the seven broad-seas,<BR>
There to find the fleeing vessel,<BR>
That the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
May not baffle his pursuers!"</P>
<P>Quick the virgin of the vapors<BR>
Breathed a fog upon the waters,<BR>
Made it settle on the war-ship<BR>
Of the, heroes of the Northland,<BR>
Held the minstrel, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Anchored in the fog and darkness;<BR>
Bound him one day, then a second,<BR>
Then a third till dawn of morning,<BR>
In the middle of the blue-sea,<BR>
Whence he could not flee in safety<BR>
From the wrath of his pursuers.</P>
<P>When the third night had departed,<BR>
Resting in the sea, and helpless,<BR>
Wainamoinen spake as follows,<BR>
"Not a man of strength and courage,<BR>
Not the weakest of the heroes,<BR>
Who upon the sea will suffer,<BR>
Sink and perish in the vapors,<BR>
Perish in the fog and darkness!"</P>
<P>With his sword he smote the billows,<BR>
From his magic blade flowed honey;<BR>
Quick the vapor breaks, and rises,<BR>
Leaves the waters clear for rowing;<BR>
Far extend the sky and waters,<BR>
Large the ring of the horizon,<BR>
And the troubled sea enlarges.</P>
<P>Time had journeyed little distance,<BR>
Scarce a moment had passed over,<BR>
When they heard a mighty roaring,<BR>
Heard a roaring and a rushing<BR>
Near the border of the vessel,<BR>
Where the foam was shooting skyward<BR>
O'er the boat of Wainamoinen.<BR>
Straightway youthful Ilmarinen<BR>
Sank in gravest apprehension,<BR>
From his cheeks the blood departed;<BR>
Pulled his cap down o'er his forehead,<BR>
Shook and trembled with emotion.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Casts his eyes upon the waters<BR>
Near the broad rim of his war-ship;<BR>
There perceives an ocean-wonder<BR>
With his head above the sea-foam.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, brave and mighty,<BR>
Seizes quick the water-monster,<BR>
Lifts him by his ears and questions:<BR>
"Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,<BR>
Why art rising from the blue-sea?<BR>
Wherefore dost thou leave thy castle,<BR>
Show thyself to mighty heroes,<BR>
To the heroes of Wainola?"</P>
<P>Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,<BR>
Ocean monster, manifested<BR>
Neither pleasure, nor displeasure,<BR>
Was not in the least affrighted,<BR>
Did not give the hero answer.</P>
<P>Whereupon the ancient minstrel,<BR>
Asked the second time the monster,<BR>
Urgently inquired a third time:<BR>
"Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,<BR>
Why art rising from the waters,<BR>
Wherefore dost thou leave the blue-sea?<BR>
Iku-Turso gave this answer:<BR>
For this cause I left my castle<BR>
Underneath the rolling billows:<BR>
Came I here with the intention<BR>
To destroy the Kalew-heroes,<BR>
And return the magic Sampo<BR>
To the people of Pohyola.<BR>
If thou wilt restore my freedom,<BR>
Spare my life, from pain and sorrow,<BR>
I will quick retrace my journey,<BR>
Nevermore to show my visage<BR>
To the people of Wainola,<BR>
Never while the moonlight glimmers<BR>
On the hills of Kalevala!"</P>
<P>Then the singer, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Freed the monster, Iku-Turso,<BR>
Sent him to his deep sea-castles,<BR>
Spake these words to him departing:<BR>
"Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,<BR>
Nevermore arise from ocean,<BR>
Nevermore let Northland-heroes<BR>
See thy face above the waters I<BR>
Nevermore has Iku-Turso<BR>
Risen to the ocean-level;<BR>
Never since have Northland sailors<BR>
Seen the head of this sea-monster.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Onward rowed his goodly vessel,<BR>
Journeyed but a little distance,<BR>
Scarce a moment had passed over,<BR>
When the King of all creators,<BR>
Mighty Ukko of the heavens,<BR>
Made the winds blow full of power,<BR>
Made the storms arise in fury,<BR>
Made them rage upon the waters.<BR>
From the west the winds came roaring,<BR>
From the north-east came in anger,<BR>
Winds came howling from the south-west,<BR>
Came the winds from all directions,<BR>
In their fury, rolling, roaring,<BR>
Tearing branches from the lindens,<BR>
Hurling needles from the pine-trees,<BR>
Blowing flowers from the heather,<BR>
Grasses blowing from the meadow,<BR>
Tearing up the very bottom<BR>
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea.<BR>
Roared the winds and lashed the waters<BR>
Till the waves were white with fury;<BR>
Tossed the war-ship high in ether,<BR>
Tossed away the harp of fish-bone,<BR>
Magic harp of Wainamoinen,<BR>
To the joy of King Wellamo,<BR>
To the pleasure of his people,<BR>
To the happiness of Ahto,<BR>
Ahto, rising from his caverns,<BR>
On the floods beheld his people<BR>
Carry off the harp of magic<BR>
To their home below the billows.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Heavy-hearted, spake these measures:<BR>
"I have lost what I created,<BR>
I have lost the harp of joyance;<BR>
Now my strength has gone to others,<BR>
All my pleasure too departed,<BR>
All my hope and comfort vanished!<BR>
Nevermore the harp of fish-bone<BR>
Will enchant the hosts of Suomi!"</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Sorrow-laden, spake as follows:<BR>
"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<BR>
Would that I had never journeyed<BR>
On these waters filled with dangers,<BR>
On the rolling waste before me,<BR>
In this war-ship false and feeble.<BR>
Winds and storms have I encountered,<BR>
Wretched days of toil and trouble,<BR>
I have witnessed in the Northland;<BR>
Never have I met such dangers<BR>
On the land, nor on the ocean,<BR>
Never in my hero life-time!"</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Spake and these the words he uttered:<BR>
"Weep no more, my goodly comrades,<BR>
In my bark let no one murmur;<BR>
Weeping cannot mend disaster,<BR>
Tears can never still misfortune,<BR>
Mourning cannot save from evil.</P>
<P>"Sea, command thy warring forces,<BR>
Bid thy children cease their fury!<BR>
Ahto, still thy surging billows!<BR>
Sink, Wellamo, to thy slumber,<BR>
That our boat may move in safety.<BR>
Rise, ye storm-winds, to your kingdoms,<BR>
Lift your heads above the waters,<BR>
To the regions of your kindred,<BR>
To your people and dominions;<BR>
Cut the trees within the forest,<BR>
Bend the lindens of the valley,<BR>
Let our vessel sail in safety!"</P>
<P>Then the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome wizard, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Spake these words in supplication:<BR>
"Come, O eagle, Turyalander,<BR>
Bring three feathers from thy pinions,<BR>
Three, O raven, three, O eagle,<BR>
To protect this bark from evil!"</P>
<P>All the heroes of Wainola<BR>
Call their forces to the rescue,<BR>
And repair the sinking vessel.<BR>
By the aid of master-magic,<BR>
Wainamoinen saved his war-ship,<BR>
Saved his people from destruction,<BR>
Well repaired his ship to battle<BR>
With the roughest seas of Northland;<BR>
Steers his mighty boat in safety<BR>
Through the perils of the whirlpool,<BR>
Through the watery deeps and dangers.</P>
