<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WAINAMOINEN'S BOAT-BUILDING.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<BR>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<BR>
For his boat was working lumber,<BR>
Working long upon his vessel,<BR>
On a fog-point jutting seaward,<BR>
On an island, forest-covered;<BR>
But the lumber failed the master,<BR>
Beams were wanting for his vessel,<BR>
Beams and scantling, ribs and flooring.<BR>
Who will find for him the lumber,<BR>
Who procure the timber needed<BR>
For the boat of Wainamoinen,<BR>
For the bottom of his vessel?</P>
<P>Pellerwoinen of the prairies,<BR>
Sampsa, slender-grown and ancient,<BR>
He will seek the needful timber,<BR>
He procure the beams of oak-wood<BR>
For the boat of Wainamoinen,<BR>
For the bottom of his vessel.</P>
<P>Soon he starts upon his journey<BR>
To the eastern fields and forests,<BR>
Hunts throughout the Northland mountain<BR>
To a second mountain wanders,<BR>
To a third he hastens, searching,<BR>
Golden axe upon his shoulder,<BR>
In his hand a copper hatchet.<BR>
Comes an aspen-tree to meet him<BR>
Of the height of seven fathoms.<BR>
Sampsa takes his axe of copper,<BR>
Starts to fell the stately aspen,<BR>
But the aspen quickly halting,<BR>
Speaks these words to Pellerwoinen:<BR>
"Tell me, hero, what thou wishest,<BR>
What the service thou art needing?"<BR>
Sampsa Pellerwoinen answers:<BR>
"This indeed, the needed service<BR>
That I ask of thee, O aspen:<BR>
Need thy lumber for a vessel,<BR>
For the boat of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Wisest of the wisdom-singers."</P>
<P>Quick and wisely speaks the aspen,<BR>
Thus its hundred branches answer:<BR>
"All the boats that have been fashioned<BR>
From my wood have proved but failures;<BR>
Such a vessel floats a distance,<BR>
Then it sinks upon the bottom<BR>
Of the waters it should travel.<BR>
All my trunk is filled with hollows,<BR>
Three times in the summer seasons<BR>
Worms devour my stem and branches,<BR>
Feed upon my heart and tissues."</P>
<P>Pellerwoinen leaves the aspen,<BR>
Hunts again through all the forest,<BR>
Wanders through the woods of Northland,<BR>
Where a pine-tree comes to meet him,<BR>
Of the height of fourteen fathoms.</P>
<P>With his axe he chops the pine-tree,<BR>
Strikes it with his axe of copper,<BR>
As he asks the pine this question:<BR>
"Will thy trunk give worthy timber<BR>
For the boat of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Wisest of the wisdom-singers?"<BR>
Loudly does the pine-tree answer:<BR>
"All the ships that have been fashioned<BR>
From my body are unworthy;<BR>
I am full of imperfections,<BR>
Cannot give thee needed timber<BR>
Wherewithal to build thy vessel;<BR>
Ravens live within ray branches,<BR>
Build their nests and hatch their younglings<BR>
Three times in my trunk in summer."</P>
<P>Sampsa leaves the lofty pine-tree,<BR>
Wanders onward, onward, onward,<BR>
To the woods of gladsome summer,<BR>
Where an oak-tree comes to meet him,<BR>
In circumference, three fathoms,<BR>
And the oak he thus addresses:<BR>
"Ancient oak-tree, will thy body<BR>
Furnish wood to build a vessel,<BR>
Build a boat for Wainamoinen,<BR>
Master-boat for the magician,<BR>
Wisest of the wisdom-singers?"<BR>
Thus the oak replies to Sampsa:<BR>
"I for thee will gladly furnish<BR>
Wood to build the hero's vessel;<BR>
I am tall, and sound, and hardy,<BR>
Have no flaws within my body;<BR>
Three times in the months of summer,<BR>
In the warmest of the seasons,<BR>
Does the sun dwell in my tree-top,<BR>
On my trunk the moonlight glimmers,<BR>
In my branches sings the cuckoo,<BR>
In my top her nestlings slumber."</P>
<P>Now the ancient Pellerwoinen<BR>
Takes the hatchet from his shoulder,<BR>
Takes his axe with copper handle,<BR>
Chops the body of the oak-tree;<BR>
Well he knows the art of chopping.<BR>
Soon he fells the tree majestic,<BR>
Fells the mighty forest-monarch,<BR>
With his magic axe and power.<BR>
From the stems he lops the branches,<BR>
Splits the trunk in many pieces,<BR>
Fashions lumber for the bottom,<BR>
Countless boards, and ribs, and braces,<BR>
For the singer's magic vessel,<BR>
For the boat of the magician.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and skilful,<BR>
The eternal wonder-worker,<BR>
Builds his vessel with enchantment,<BR>
Builds his boat by art of magic,<BR>
From the timber of the oak-tree,<BR>
From its posts, and planks, and flooring.<BR>
Sings a song, and joins the frame-work;<BR>
Sings a second, sets the siding;<BR>
Sings a third time, sets the row-locks;<BR>
Fashions oars, and ribs, and rudder,<BR>
Joins the sides and ribs together.<BR>
When the ribs were firmly fastened,<BR>
When the sides were tightly jointed,<BR>
Then alas! three words were wanting,<BR>
Lost the words of master-magic,<BR>
How to fasten in the ledges,<BR>
How the stern should be completed,<BR>
How complete the boat's forecastle.</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Wise and wonderful enchanter,<BR>
Heavy-hearted spake as follows:<BR>
"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<BR>
Never will this magic vessel<BR>
Pass in safety o'er the water,<BR>
Never ride the rough sea-billows."</P>
<P>Then he thought and long considered,<BR>
Where to find these words of magic,<BR>
Find the lost-words of the Master:<BR>
"From the brains of countless swallows,<BR>
From the heads of swans in dying,<BR>
From the plumage of the gray-duck?"</P>
<P>For these words the hero searches,<BR>
Kills of swans a goodly number,<BR>
Kills a flock of fattened gray-duck,<BR>
Kills of swallows countless numbers,<BR>
Cannot find the words of magic,<BR>
Not the lost-words of the Master.<BR>
Wainamoinen, wisdom-singer,<BR>
Still reflected and debated:<BR>
"I perchance may find the lost-words<BR>
On the tongue of summer-reindeer,<BR>
In the mouth of the white squirrel."</P>
<P>Now again he hunts the lost-words,<BR>
Hastes to find the magic sayings,<BR>
Kills a countless host of reindeer,<BR>
Kills a rafterful of squirrels,<BR>
Finds of words a goodly number,<BR>
But they are of little value,<BR>
Cannot find the magic lost-word.<BR>
Long he thought and well considered:<BR>
"I can find of words a hundred<BR>
In the dwellings of Tuoni,<BR>
In the Manala fields and castles."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen quickly journeys<BR>
To the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
There to find the ancient wisdom,<BR>
There to learn the secret doctrine;<BR>
Hastens on through fen and forest,<BR>
Over meads and over marshes,<BR>
Through the ever-rising woodlands,<BR>
Journeys one week through the brambles,<BR>
And a second through the hazels,<BR>
Through the junipers the third week,<BR>
When appear Tuoni's islands,<BR>
And the Manala fields and castles.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, brave and ancient,<BR>
Calls aloud in tones of thunder,<BR>
To the Tuonela deeps and dungeons,<BR>
And to Manala's magic castle:<BR>
"Bring a boat, Tuoni's daughter,<BR>
Bring a ferry-boat, O maiden,<BR>
That may bear me o'er this channel,<BR>
O'er this black and fatal river."</P>
<P>Quick the daughter of Tuoni,<BR>
Magic maid of little stature,<BR>
Tiny virgin of Manala,<BR>
Tiny washer of the linen,<BR>
Tiny cleaner of the dresses,<BR>
At the river of Tuoni,<BR>
In Manala's ancient castles,<BR>
Speaks these words to Wainamoinen,<BR>
Gives this answer to his calling:<BR>
"Straightway will I bring the row-boat,<BR>
When the reasons thou hast given<BR>
Why thou comest to Manala<BR>
In a hale and active body."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and artful.,<BR>
Gives this answer to the maiden:<BR>
"I was brought here by Tuoni,<BR>
Mana raised me from the coffin."<BR>
Speaks the maiden of Manala:<BR>
"This a tale of wretched liars;<BR>
Had Tuoni brought thee hither,<BR>
Mana raised thee from the coffin,<BR>
Then Tuoni would be with thee,<BR>
Manalainen too would lead thee,<BR>
With Tuoni's hat upon thee,<BR>
On thy hands, the gloves of Mana;<BR>
Tell the truth now, Wainamoinen,<BR>
What has brought thee to Manala?"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, artful hero,<BR>
Gives this answer, still finessing:<BR>
"Iron brought me to Manala,<BR>
To the kingdom of Tuoni."</P>
<P>Speaks the virgin of the death-land,<BR>
Mana's wise and tiny daughter:<BR>
"Well I know that this is falsehood,<BR>
Had the iron brought thee hither,<BR>
Brought thee to Tuoni's kingdom,<BR>
Blood would trickle from thy vesture,<BR>
And the blood-drops, scarlet-colored.<BR>
Speak the truth now, Wainamoinen,<BR>
This the third time that I ask thee."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, little heeding,<BR>
Still finesses to the daughter:<BR>
"Water brought me to Manala,<BR>
To the kingdom of Tuoui."<BR>
This the tiny maiden's answer:<BR>
"Well I know thou speakest falsely;<BR>
If the waters of Manala,<BR>
If the cataract and whirlpool,<BR>
Or the waves had brought thee hither,<BR>
From thy robes the drops would trickle,<BR>
Water drip from all thy raiment.<BR>
Tell the truth and I will serve thee,<BR>
What has brought thee to Manala?"</P>
<P>Then the wilful Wainamoinen<BR>
Told this falsehood to the maiden:<BR>
"Fire has brought me to Manala,<BR>
To the kingdom of Tuoni."<BR>
Spake again Tuoni's daughter:<BR>
"Well I know the voice of falsehood.<BR>
If the fire had brought thee hither,<BR>
Brought thee to Tuoni's empire,<BR>
Singed would be thy locks and eyebrows,<BR>
And thy beard be crisped and tangled.<BR>
O, thou foolish Wainamoinen,<BR>
If I row thee o'er the ferry,<BR>
Thou must speak the truth in answer,<BR>
This the last time I will ask thee;<BR>
Make an end of thy deception.<BR>
What has brought thee to Manala,<BR>
Still unharmed by pain or sickness,<BR>
Still untouched by Death's dark angel<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"At the first I spake, not truly,<BR>
Now I give thee rightful answer:<BR>
I a boat with ancient wisdom,<BR>
Fashioned with my powers of magic,<BR>
Sang one day and then a second,<BR>
Sang the third day until evening,<BR>
When I broke the magic main-spring,<BR>
Broke my magic sledge in pieces,<BR>
Of my song the fleetest runners;<BR>
Then I come to Mana's kingdom,<BR>
Came to borrow here a hatchet,<BR>
Thus to mend my sledge of magic,<BR>
Thus to join the parts together.<BR>
Send the boat now quickly over,<BR>
Send me, quick, Tuoni's row-boat,<BR>
Help me cross this fatal river,<BR>
Cross the channel of Manala."</P>
<P>Spake the daughter of Tuoni,<BR>
Mana's maiden thus replying:<BR>
"Thou art sure a stupid fellow,<BR>
Foresight wanting, judgment lacking,<BR>
Having neither wit nor wisdom,<BR>
Coming here without a reason,<BR>
Coming to Tuoni's empire;<BR>
Better far if thou shouldst journey<BR>
To thy distant home and kindred;<BR>
Man they that visit Mana,<BR>
Few return from Maria's kingdom."</P>
<P>Spake the good old Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Women old retreat from danger,<BR>
Not a man of any courage,<BR>
Not the weakest of the heroes.<BR>
Bring thy boat, Tuoni's daughter,<BR>
Tiny maiden of Manala,<BR>
Come and row me o'er the ferry."</P>
<P>Mana's daughter does as bidden,<BR>
Brings her boat to Wainamoinen,<BR>
Quickly rows him through the channel,<BR>
O'er the black and fatal river,<BR>
To the kingdom of Manala,<BR>
Speaks these words to the magician:<BR>
"Woe to thee! O Wainamoinen!<BR>
Wonderful indeed, thy magic,<BR>
Since thou comest to Manala,<BR>
Comest neither dead nor dying."</P>
<P>Tuonetar, the death-land hostess,<BR>
Ancient hostess of Tuoni,<BR>
Brings him pitchers filled with strong-beer,<BR>
Fills her massive golden goblets,<BR>
Speaks these measures to the stranger:<BR>
"Drink, thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Drink the beer of king Tuoni!"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, wise and cautious,<BR>
Carefully inspects the liquor,<BR>
Looks a long time in the pitchers,<BR>
Sees the spawning of the black-frogs,<BR>
Sees the young of poison-serpents,<BR>
Lizards, worms, and writhing adders,<BR>
Thus addresses Tuonetar:<BR>
"Have not come with this intention,<BR>
Have not come to drink thy poisons,<BR>
Drink the beer of Tuonela;<BR>
Those that drink Tuoni's liquors,<BR>
Those that sip the cups of Mana,<BR>
Court the Devil and destruction,<BR>
End their lives in want and ruin."<BR>
Tuonetar makes this answer:<BR>
"Ancient minstrel, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Tell me what has brought thee hither,<BR>
Brought thee to the, realm of Mana,<BR>
To the courts of Tuonela,<BR>
Ere Tuoni sent his angels<BR>
To thy home in Kalevala,<BR>
There to cut thy magic life-thread."<BR>
Spake the singer, Wainamoinen:<BR>
"I was building me a vessel,<BR>
At my craft was working, singing,<BR>
Needed three words of the Master,<BR>
How to fasten in the ledges,<BR>
How the stern should be completed,<BR>
How complete the boat's forecastle.<BR>
This the reason of my coming<BR>
To the empire of Tuoni,<BR>
To the castles of Manala:<BR>
Came to learn these magic sayings,<BR>
Learn the lost-words of the Master."<BR>
Spake the hostess, Tuonetar:<BR>
"Mana never gives these sayings,<BR>
Canst not learn them from Tuoni,<BR>
Not the lost-words of the Master;<BR>
Thou shalt never leave this kingdom,<BR>
Never in thy magic life-time,<BR>
Never go to Kalevala,<BR>
To Wainola's peaceful meadows.<BR>
To thy distant home and country."</P>
<P>Quick the hostess, Tuonetar,<BR>
Waves her magic wand of slumber<BR>
O'er the head of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Puts to rest the wisdom-hero,<BR>
Lays him on the couch of Mana,<BR>
In the robes of living heroes,<BR>
Deep the sleep that settles o'er him.<BR>
In Manala lived a woman,<BR>
In the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
Evil witch and toothless wizard,<BR>
Spinner of the threads of iron,<BR>
Moulder of the bands of copper,<BR>
Weaver of a hundred fish-nets,<BR>
Of a thousand nets of copper,<BR>
Spinning in the days of summer,<BR>
Weaving in the winter evenings,<BR>
Seated on a rock in water.</P>
<P>In the kingdom of Tuoni<BR>
Lived a man, a wicked wizard,<BR>
Three the fingers of the hero,<BR>
Spinner he of iron meshes,<BR>
Maker too of nets of copper,<BR>
Countless were his nets of metal,<BR>
Moulded on a rock in water,<BR>
Through the many days of summer.</P>
<P>Mana's son with crooked fingers,<BR>
Iron-pointed, copper fingers,<BR>
Pulls of nets, at least a thousand,<BR>
Through the river of Tuoni,<BR>
Sets them lengthwise, sets them crosswise,<BR>
In the fatal, darksome river,<BR>
That the sleeping Wainamomen,<BR>
Friend and brother of the waters,<BR>
May not leave the isle of Mana,<BR>
Never in the course of ages,<BR>
Never leave the death-land castles,<BR>
Never while the moonlight glimmers<BR>
On the empire of Tuoni.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, wise and wary,<BR>
Rising from his couch of slumber,<BR>
Speaks these words as he is waking:<BR>
"Is there not some mischief brewing,<BR>
Am I not at last in danger,<BR>
In the chambers of Tuoni,<BR>
In the Manala home and household?"</P>
<P>Quick he changes his complexion,<BR>
Changes too his form and feature,<BR>
Slips into another body;<BR>
Like a serpent in a circle,<BR>
Rolls black-dyed upon the waters;<BR>
Like a snake among the willows,<BR>
Crawls he like a worm of magic,<BR>
Like an adder through the grasses,<BR>
Through the coal-black stream of death-land,<BR>
Through a thousand nets of copper<BR>
Interlaced with threads of iron,<BR>
From the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
From the castles of Manala.</P>
<P>Mana's son, the wicked wizard,<BR>
With his iron-pointed fingers,<BR>
In the early morning hastens<BR>
To his thousand nets of copper,<BR>
Set within the Tuoni river,<BR>
Finds therein a countless number<BR>
Of the death-stream fish and serpents;<BR>
Does not find old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Wainamoinen, wise and wary,<BR>
Friend and fellow of the waters.</P>
<P>When the wonder-working hero<BR>
Had escaped from Tuonela,<BR>
Spake he thus in supplication:<BR>
"Gratitude to thee, O Ukko,<BR>
Do I bring for thy protection!<BR>
Never suffer other heroes,<BR>
Of thy heroes not the wisest,<BR>
To transgress the laws of nature;<BR>
Never let another singer,<BR>
While he lives within the body,<BR>
Cross the river of Tuoni,<BR>
As thou lovest thy creations.<BR>
Many heroes cross the channel,<BR>
Cross the fatal stream of Mana,<BR>
Few return to tell the story,<BR>
Few return from Tuonela,<BR>
From Manala's courts and castles."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen calls his people,<BR>
On the plains of Kalevala,<BR>
Speaks these words of ancient wisdom,<BR>
To the young men, to the maidens,<BR>
To the rising generation:<BR>
"Every child of Northland, listen:<BR>
If thou wishest joy eternal,<BR>
Never disobey thy parents,<BR>
Never evil treat the guiltless,<BR>
Never wrong the feeble-minded,<BR>
Never harm thy weakest fellow,<BR>
Never stain thy lips with falsehood,<BR>
Never cheat thy trusting neighbor,<BR>
Never injure thy companion,<BR>
Lest thou surely payest penance<BR>
In the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
In the prison of Manala;<BR>
There, the home of all the wicked,<BR>
There the couch of the unworthy,<BR>
There the chambers of the guilty.<BR>
Underneath Manala's fire-rock<BR>
Are their ever-flaming couches,<BR>
For their pillows hissing serpents,<BR>
Vipers green their writhing covers,<BR>
For their drink the blood of adders,<BR>
For their food the pangs of hunger,<BR>
Pain and agony their solace;<BR>
If thou wishest joy eternal,<BR>
Shun the kingdom of Tuoui!"</P>
