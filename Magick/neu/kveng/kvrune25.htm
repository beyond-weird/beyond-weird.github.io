<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WAINAMOINEN'S WEDDING-SONGS.</H1>
<P>AT the home of Ilmarinen<BR>
Long had they been watching, waiting,<BR>
For the coming of the blacksmith,<BR>
With his bride from Sariola.<BR>
Weary were the eyes of watchers,<BR>
Waiting from the father's portals,<BR>
Looking from the mother's windows;<BR>
Weary were the young knees standing<BR>
At the gates of the magician;<BR>
Weary grew the feet of children,<BR>
Tramping to the walls and watching;<BR>
Worn and torn, the shoes of heroes,<BR>
Running on the shore to meet him.</P>
<P>Now at last upon a morning<BR>
Of a lovely day in winter,<BR>
Heard they from the woods the rumble<BR>
Of a snow-sledge swiftly bounding.<BR>
Lakko, hostess of Wainola,<BR>
She the lovely Kalew-daughter,<BR>
Spake these words in great excitement:<BR>
"'Tis the sledge of the magician,<BR>
Comes at last the metal-worker<BR>
From the dismal Sariola,<BR>
By his side the Bride of Beauty!<BR>
Welcome, welcome, to this hamlet,<BR>
Welcome to thy mother's hearth-stone,<BR>
To the dwelling of thy father,<BR>
By thine ancestors erected!"</P>
<P>Straightway came great Ilmarinen<BR>
To his cottage drove the blacksmith,<BR>
To the fireside of his father,<BR>
To his mother's ancient dwelling.<BR>
Hazel-birds were sweetly singing<BR>
On the newly-bended collar;<BR>
Sweetly called the sacred cuckoos<BR>
From the summit of the break-board;<BR>
Merry, jumped the graceful squirrel<BR>
On the oaken shafts and cross-bar.</P>
<P>Lakko, Kalew's fairest hostess,<BR>
Beauteous daughter of Wainola,<BR>
Spake these words of hearty welcome:<BR>
"For the new moon hopes the village,<BR>
For the sun, the happy maidens,<BR>
For the boat, the swelling water;<BR>
I have not the moon expected,<BR>
For the sun have not been waiting,<BR>
I have waited for my hero,<BR>
Waited for the Bride of Beauty;<BR>
Watched at morning, watched at evening,<BR>
Did not know but some misfortune,<BR>
Some sad fate had overtaken<BR>
Bride and bridegroom on their journey;<BR>
Thought the maiden growing weary,<BR>
Weary of my son's attentions,<BR>
Since he faithfully had promised<BR>
To return to Kalevala,<BR>
Ere his foot-prints had departed<BR>
From the snow-fields of his father.<BR>
Every morn I looked and listened,<BR>
Constantly I thought and wondered<BR>
When his sledge would rumble homeward,<BR>
When it would return triumphant<BR>
To his home, renowned and ancient.<BR>
Had a blind and beggared straw-horse<BR>
Hobbled to these shores awaiting,<BR>
With a sledge of but two pieces,<BR>
Well the steed would have been lauded,<BR>
Had it brought my son beloved,<BR>
Had it brought the Bride of Beauty.<BR>
Thus I waited long, impatient,<BR>
Looking out from morn till even,<BR>
Watching with my head extended,<BR>
With my tresses streaming southward,<BR>
With my eyelids widely opened,<BR>
Waiting for my son's returning<BR>
To this modest home of heroes,<BR>
To this narrow place of resting.<BR>
Finally am I rewarded,<BR>
For the sledge has come triumphant,<BR>
Bringing home my son and hero,<BR>
By his side the Rainbow maiden,<BR>
Red her cheeks, her visage winsome,<BR>
Pride and joy of Sariola.</P>
<P>"Wizard-bridegroom of Wainola,<BR>
Take thy-courser to the stable,<BR>
Lead him to the well-filled manger,<BR>
To the best of grain and clover;<BR>
Give to us thy friendly greetings,<BR>
Greetings send to all thy people.<BR>
When thy greetings thou hast ended,<BR>
Then relate what has befallen<BR>
To our hero in his absence.<BR>
Hast thou gone without adventure<BR>
To the dark fields of Pohyola,<BR>
Searching for the Maid of Beauty?<BR>
Didst thou scale the hostile ramparts,<BR>
Didst thou take the virgin's mansion,<BR>
Passing o'er her mother's threshold,<BR>
Visiting the halls of Louhi?</P>
<P>"But I know without the asking,<BR>
See the answer to my question:<BR>
Comest from the North a victor,<BR>
On thy journey well contented;<BR>
Thou hast brought the Northland daughter,<BR>
Thou hast razed the hostile portals,<BR>
Thou hast stormed the forts of Louhi,<BR>
Stormed the mighty walls opposing,<BR>
On thy journey to Pohyola,<BR>
To the village of the father.<BR>
In thy care the bride is sitting,<BR>
In thine arms, the Rainbow-maiden,<BR>
At thy side, the pride of Northland,<BR>
Mated to the highly-gifted.<BR>
Who has told the cruel story,<BR>
Who the worst of news has scattered,<BR>
That thy suit was unsuccessful,<BR>
That in vain thy steed had journeyed?<BR>
Not in vain has been thy wooing,<BR>
Not in vain thy steed has travelled<BR>
To the dismal homes of Lapland;<BR>
He has journeyed heavy laden,<BR>
Shaken mane, and tail, and forelock,<BR>
Dripping foam from lips and nostrils,<BR>
Through the bringing of the maiden,<BR>
With the burden of the husband.</P>
<P>"Come, thou beauty, from the snow-sledge,<BR>
Come, descend thou from the cross-bench,<BR>
Do not linger for assistance,<BR>
Do not tarry to be carried;<BR>
If too young the one that lifts thee,<BR>
If too proud the one in waiting,<BR>
Rise thou, graceful, like a young bird,<BR>
Hither glide along the pathway,<BR>
On the tan-bark scarlet- colored,<BR>
That the herds of kine have evened,<BR>
That the gentle lambs have trodden,<BR>
Smoothened by the tails of horses.<BR>
Haste thou here with gentle footsteps,<BR>
Through the pathway smooth and tidy,<BR>
On the tiles of even surface,<BR>
On thy second father's court-yard,<BR>
To thy second mother's dwelling,<BR>
To thy brother's place of resting,<BR>
To thy sister's silent chambers.<BR>
Place thy foot within these portals,<BR>
Step across this waiting threshold,<BR>
Enter thou these halls of joyance,<BR>
Underneath these painted rafters,<BR>
Underneath this roof of ages.<BR>
During all the winter evenings,<BR>
Through the summer gone forever,<BR>
Sang the tiling made of ivory,<BR>
Wishing thou wouldst walk upon it;<BR>
Often sang the golden ceiling,<BR>
Hoping thou wouldst walk beneath it,<BR>
And the windows often whistled,<BR>
Asking thee to sit beside them;<BR>
Even on this merry morning,<BR>
Even on the recent evening,<BR>
Sat the aged at their windows,<BR>
On the sea-shore ran the children,<BR>
Near the walls the maidens waited,<BR>
Ran the boys upon the highway,<BR>
There to watch the young bride's coming,<BR>
Coming with her hero-husband.</P>
<P>"Hail, ye courtiers of Wainola,<BR>
With the heroes of the fathers,<BR>
Hail to thee, Wainola's hamlet,<BR>
Hail, ye halls with heroes peopled,<BR>
Hail, ye rooms with all your inmates,<BR>
Hail to thee, sweet golden moonlight,<BR>
Hail to thee, benignant Ukko,<BR>
Hail companions of the bridegroom!<BR>
Never has there been in Northland<BR>
Such a wedding-train of honor,<BR>
Never such a bride of beauty.</P>
<P>"Bridegroom, thou beloved hero,<BR>
Now untie the scarlet ribbons,<BR>
And remove the silken muffler,<BR>
Let us see the honey-maiden,<BR>
See the Daughter of the Rainbow.<BR>
Seven years hast thou been wooing,<BR>
Hast thou brought the maid affianced,<BR>
Wainamoinen's Wedding-Songs.<BR>
Hast thou sought a sweeter cuckoo,<BR>
Sought one fairer than the moonlight,<BR>
Sought a mermaid from the ocean?<BR>
But I know without the asking,<BR>
See the answer to my question:<BR>
Thou hast brought the sweet-voiced cuckoo,<BR>
Thou hast found the swan of beauty<BR>
Plucked the sweetest flower of Northland,<BR>
Culled the fairest of the jewels,<BR>
Gathered Pohya's sweetest berry!"</P>
<P>Sat a babe upon the matting,<BR>
And the young child spake as follows:<BR>
"Brother, what is this thou bringest,<BR>
Aspen-log or trunk of willow,<BR>
Slender as the mountain-linden?<BR>
Bridegroom, well dost thou remember,<BR>
Thou hast hoped it all thy life-time,<BR>
Hoped to bring the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
Thou a thousand times hast said it,<BR>
Better far than any other,<BR>
Not one like the croaking raven,<BR>
Nor the magpie from the border,<BR>
Nor the scarecrow from the corn-fields,<BR>
Nor the vulture from the desert.<BR>
What has this one done of credit,<BR>
In the summer that has ended?<BR>
Where the gloves that she has knitted,<BR>
Where the mittens she has woven?<BR>
Thou hast brought her empty-handed,<BR>
Not a gift she brings thy father;<BR>
In thy chests the nice are nesting,<BR>
Long-tails feeding on thy vestments,<BR>
And thy bride, cannot repair them."</P>
<P>Lakko hostess of Wainola,<BR>
She the faithful Kalew-daughter, <BR>
Hears the young child's speech in wonder,<BR>
Speaks these words of disapproval:<BR>
Silly prattler, cease thy talking,<BR>
Thou Last spoken in dishonor;<BR>
Let all others be astonished,<BR>
Reap thy malice on thy kindred,<BR>
must not harm the Bride of Beauty,<BR>
Rainbow-daughter of the Northland.<BR>
False indeed is this thy Prattle,<BR>
All thy words are full or evil,<BR>
Fallen from thy tongue of mischief<BR>
From the lips of one unworthy.<BR>
Excellent the hero 's young bride,<BR>
Best of all in Sariola,<BR>
Like the, strawberry in summer,<BR>
Like the daisy from the meadow,<BR>
Like the cuckoo from the forest,<BR>
Like the bluebird from the aspen,<BR>
Like the redbreast from the heather,<BR>
Like the martin. from the linden;<BR>
Never couldst thou find in Ehstland<BR>
Such a virgin as this daughter,<BR>
Such a graceful beauteous maiden,<BR>
With such dignity of Carriage,<BR>
With such arms of pearly whiteness,<BR>
With. a neck so fair and lovely.<BR>
Neither is she empty-handed,<BR>
She has brought us furs abundant, <BR>
Brought us many silken garments,<BR>
Richest weavings of Pohyola.<BR>
Many beauteous things the maiden,<BR>
With the spindle has accomplished,<BR>
Spun and woven with her fingers<BR>
Dresses of the finest texture<BR>
She in winter has upfolded,<BR>
Bleached them in the days of spring-time,<BR>
Dried them at the hour of noon-day,<BR>
For our couches finest linen,<BR>
For our heads the softest pillows,<BR>
For our comfort woollen blankets,<BR>
For our necks the silken ribbons."<BR>
To the bride speaks gracious Lakko:<BR>
"Goodly wife, thou Maid of Beauty,<BR>
Highly wert thou praised as daughter,<BR>
In thy father's distant country;<BR>
Here thou shalt be praised forever<BR>
By the kindred of thy husband;<BR>
Thou shalt never suffer sorrow,<BR>
Never give thy heart to grieving;<BR>
In the swamps thou wert not nurtured,<BR>
Wert not fed beside the brooklets;<BR>
Thou wert born 'neath stars auspicious,<BR>
Nurtured from the richest garners,<BR>
Thou wert taken to the brewing<BR>
Of the sweetest beer in Northland.</P>
<P>"Beauteous bride from Sariola,<BR>
Shouldst thou see me bringing hither<BR>
Casks of corn, or wheat, or barley;<BR>
Bringing rye in great abundance,<BR>
They belong to this thy household;<BR>
Good the plowing of thy husband.<BR>
Good his sowing and his reaping.</P>
<P>"Bride of Beauty from the Northland,<BR>
Thou wilt learn this home to manage,<BR>
Learn to labor with thy kindred;<BR>
Good the home for thee to dwell in,<BR>
Good enough for bride and daughter.<BR>
At thy hand will rest the milk-pail,<BR>
And the churn awaits thine order;<BR>
It is well here for the maiden,<BR>
Happy will the young bride labor,<BR>
Easy are the resting-benches;<BR>
Here the host is like thy father,<BR>
Like thy mother is the hostess,<BR>
All the sons are like thy brothers,<BR>
Like thy sisters are the daughters.</P>
<P>"Shouldst thou ever have a longing<BR>
For the whiting of the ocean,<BR>
For thy, father's Northland salmon,<BR>
For thy brother's hazel-chickens,<BR>
Ask them only of thy husband,<BR>
Let thy hero-husband bring them.<BR>
There is not in all of Northland,<BR>
Not a creature of the forest,<BR>
Not a bird beneath the ether,<BR>
Not a fish within the waters,<BR>
Not the largest, nor the smallests<BR>
That thy husband cannot capture.<BR>
It is well here for the maiden,<BR>
Here the bride may live in freedom,<BR>
Need not turn the heavy millstone,<BR>
Need not move the iron pestle;<BR>
Here the wheat is ground by water,<BR>
For the rye, the swifter current,<BR>
While the billows wash the vessels<BR>
And the surging waters rinse them.<BR>
Thou hast here a lovely village,<BR>
Finest spot in all of Northland,<BR>
In the lowlands sweet the verdure,<BR>
in the uplands, fields of beauty,<BR>
With the lake-shore near the hamlet,<BR>
Near thy home the running water,<BR>
Where the goslings swim and frolic,<BR>
Water-birds disport in numbers."</P>
<P>Thereupon the bride and bridegroom<BR>
Were refreshed with richest viands,<BR>
Given food and drink abundant,<BR>
Fed on choicest bits of reindeer,<BR>
On the sweetest loaves of barley,<BR>
On the best of wheaten biscuits,<BR>
On the richest beer of Northland.<BR>
Many things were on the table,<BR>
Many dainties of Wainola,<BR>
In the bowls of scarlet color,<BR>
In the platters deftly painted,<BR>
Many cakes with honey sweetened,<BR>
To each guest was butter given,<BR>
Many bits of trout and whiting,<BR>
Larger salmon carved in slices,<BR>
With the knives of molten silver,<BR>
Rimmed with gold the silver handles,<BR>
Beer of barley ceaseless flowing,<BR>
Honey-drink that was not purchased,<BR>
In the cellar flows profusely,<BR>
Beer for all, the tongues to quicken,<BR>
Mead and beer the minds to freshen.<BR>
Who is there to lead the singing,<BR>
Lead the songs of Kalevala?</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
The eternal, wise enchanter,<BR>
Quick begins his incantations,<BR>
Straightway sings the songs that follow.<BR>
"Golden brethren, dearest kindred,<BR>
Ye, my loved ones, wise and worthy<BR>
Ye companions, highly-gifted,<BR>
Listen to my simple sayings:<BR>
Rarely stand the geese together,<BR>
Sisters do not mate each other,<BR>
Not together stand the brothers,<BR>
Nor the children of one mother,<BR>
In the countries of the Northland.</P>
<P>"Shall we now begin the singing,<BR>
Sing the songs of old tradition?<BR>
Singers can but sing their wisdom,<BR>
And the cuckoo call the spring-time,<BR>
And the goddess of the heavens<BR>
Only dyes the earth in beauty;<BR>
So the goddesses of weaving<BR>
Can but weave from dawn till twilight,<BR>
Ever sing the youth of Lapland<BR>
In their straw-shoes full of gladness,<BR>
When the coarse-meat of the roebuck,<BR>
Or of blue-moose they have eaten.<BR>
Wherefore should I not be singing,<BR>
And the children not be chanting<BR>
Of the biscuits of Wainola,<BR>
Of the bread of Kalew-waters?<BR>
Even Sing the lads of Lapland<BR>
In their straw-shoes filled with joyance,<BR>
Drinking but a cup of water,<BR>
Eating but the bitter tan-bark.<BR>
Wherefore should I not be singing,<BR>
And the children not be chanting<BR>
Of the beer of Kalevala,<BR>
Brewed from barley in perfection,<BR>
Dressed in quaint and homely costume,<BR>
As they sit beside their hearth-stones.<BR>
Wherefore should I not be singing,<BR>
And the children too be chanting<BR>
Underneath these painted rafters,<BR>
In these halls renowned and ancient?<BR>
This the place for men to linger,<BR>
This the court-room for the maidens,<BR>
Near the foaming beer of barley,<BR>
Honey-brewed in great abundance,<BR>
Very near, the salmon-waters,<BR>
Near, the nets for trout and whiting,<BR>
Here where food is never wanting,<BR>
Where the beer is ever brewing.<BR>
Here Wainola's sons assemble,<BR>
Here Wainola's daughters gather,<BR>
Here they never eat in trouble,<BR>
Here they live without regretting,<BR>
In the life-time of the landlord,<BR>
While the hostess lives and prospers.</P>
<P>"Who shall first be sung and lauded?<BR>
Shall it be the bride or bridegroom?<BR>
Let us praise the bridegroom's father,<BR>
Let the hero-host be chanted,<BR>
Him whose home is in the forest,<BR>
Him who built upon the mountains,<BR>
Him who brought the trunks of lindens,<BR>
With their tops and slender branches,<BR>
Brought them to the best of places,<BR>
Joined them skilfully together,<BR>
For the mansion of the nation,<BR>
For this famous hero-dwelling,<BR>
Walls procured upon the lowlands,<BR>
Rafters from the pine and fir-tree,<BR>
From the woodlands beams of oak-wood,<BR>
From the berry-plains the studding,<BR>
Bark was furnished by the aspen,<BR>
And the mosses from the fenlands.<BR>
Trimly builded is this mansion,<BR>
In a haven warmly sheltered;<BR>
Here a hundred men have labored,<BR>
On the roof have stood a thousand,<BR>
As this spacious house was building,<BR>
As this roof was tightly jointed.<BR>
Here the ancient mansion-builder,<BR>
When these rafters were erected,<BR>
Lost in storms his locks of sable,<BR>
Scattered by the winds of heaven.<BR>
Often has the hero-landlord<BR>
On the rocks his gloves forgotten,<BR>
Left his hat upon the willows,<BR>
Lost his mittens in the marshes;<BR>
Oftentimes the mansion-builder,<BR>
In the early hours of morning,<BR>
Ere his workmen had awakened,<BR>
Unperceived by all the village,<BR>
Has arisen from his slumber,<BR>
Left his cabin the snow-fields,<BR>
Combed his locks among the branches,<BR>
Bathed his eyes in dews of morning.</P>
<P>"Thus obtained the pleasant landlord<BR>
Friends to fill his spacious dwelling,<BR>
Fill his benches with magicians,<BR>
Fill his windows with enchanters,<BR>
Fill his halls with wizard-singers,<BR>
Fill his floors with ancient speakers,<BR>
Fill his ancient court with strangers,<BR>
Fill his hurdles with the needy;<BR>
Thus the Kalew-host is lauded.</P>
<P>"Now I praise the genial hostess,<BR>
Who prepares the toothsome dinner,<BR>
Fills with plenty all her tables,<BR>
Bakes the honeyed loaves of barley,<BR>
Kneads the dough with magic fingers,<BR>
With her arms of strength and beauty,<BR>
Bakes her bread in copper ovens,<BR>
Feeds her guests and bids them welcome,<BR>
Feeds them on the toothsome bacon,<BR>
On the trout, and pike, and whiting,<BR>
On the rarest fish in ocean,<BR>
On the dainties of Wainola.</P>
<P>"Often has the faithful hostess<BR>
Risen from her couch in silence,<BR>
Ere the crowing of the watcher,<BR>
To prepare the wedding-banquet,<BR>
Make her tables look attractive.<BR>
Brew the honey-beer of wedlock.<BR>
Excellently has the housewife,<BR>
Has the hostess filled with wisdom,<BR>
Brewed the beer from hops and barley,<BR>
From the corn of Kalevala,<BR>
From the wheat-malt honey-seasoned,<BR>
Stirred the beer with graceful fingers,<BR>
At the oven in the penthouse,<BR>
In the chamber swept and polished.<BR>
Neither did the prudent hostess,<BR>
Beautiful, and full of wisdom,<BR>
Let the barley sprout too freely,<BR>
Lest the beer should taste of black-earth,<BR>
Be too bitter in the brewing,<BR>
Often went she to the garners,<BR>
Went alone at hour of midnight,<BR>
Was not frightened by the black-wolf,<BR>
Did not fear the beasts of woodlands.</P>
<P>"Now the hostess I have lauded,<BR>
Let me praise the favored suitor,<BR>
Now the honored hero-bridegroom,<BR>
Best of all the village-masters.<BR>
Clothed in purple is the hero,<BR>
Raiment brought from distant nations,<BR>
Tightly fitting to his body;<BR>
Snugly sets his coat of ermine,<BR>
To the floor it hangs in beauty,<BR>
Trailing from his neck and shoulders,<BR>
Little of his vest appearing,<BR>
Peeping through his outer raiment,<BR>
Woven by the Moon's fair daughters,<BR>
And his vestment silver-tinselled.<BR>
Dressed in neatness is the suitor,<BR>
Round his waist a belt of copper,<BR>
Hammered by the Sun's sweet maidens,<BR>
Ere the early fires were lighted,<BR>
Ere the fire had been discovered.<BR>
Dressed in richness is the bridegroom,<BR>
On his feet are silken stockings,<BR>
Silken ribbons on his ankles,<BR>
Gold and silver interwoven.<BR>
Dressed in beauty is the bridegroom,<BR>
On his feet are shoes of deer-skin,<BR>
Like the swans upon the water,<BR>
Like the blue-duck on the sea-waves,<BR>
Like the thrush among the willows,<BR>
Like the water-birds of Northland.<BR>
Well adorned the hero-suitor,<BR>
With his locks of golden color,<BR>
With his gold-beard finely braided,<BR>
Hero-hat upon his forehead,<BR>
Piercing through the forest branches,<BR>
Reaching to the clouds of heaven,<BR>
Bought with countless gold and silver,<BR>
Priceless is the suitor's head-gear.</P>
<P>"Now the bridegroom has been lauded,<BR>
I will praise the young bride's playmate,<BR>
Day-companion in her childhood,<BR>
In the maiden's magic mansion.<BR>
Whence was brought the merry maiden,<BR>
From the village of Tanikka?<BR>
Thence was never brought the playmate,<BR>
Playmate of the bride in childhood.<BR>
Has she come from distant nations,<BR>
From the waters of the Dwina,<BR>
O'er the ocean far-outstretching?<BR>
Not from Dwina came the maiden,<BR>
Did not sail across the waters;<BR>
Grew as berry in the mountains,<BR>
As a strawberry of sweetness,<BR>
On the fields the child of beauty,<BR>
In the glens the golden flower.<BR>
Thence has come the young bride's playmate,<BR>
Thence arose her fair companion.<BR>
Tiny are her feet and fingers,<BR>
Small her lips of scarlet color,<BR>
Like the maiden's loom of Suomi;<BR>
Eyes that shine in kindly beauty<BR>
Like the twinkling stars of heaven;<BR>
Beam the playmate's throbbing temples<BR>
Like the moonlight on the waters.<BR>
Trinkets has the bride's companion,<BR>
On her neck a golden necklace,<BR>
In her tresses, silken ribbons,<BR>
On her arms are golden bracelets,<BR>
Golden rings upon her fingers,<BR>
Pearls are set in golden ear-rings,<BR>
Loops of gold upon her temples,<BR>
And with pearls her brow is studded.<BR>
Northland thought the Moon was shining<BR>
When her jeweled ear-ringsglistened;<BR>
Thought the Sun had left his station<BR>
When her girdle shone in beauty;<BR>
Thought a ship was homeward sailing<BR>
When her colored head-gear fluttered.<BR>
Thus is praised the bride's companion,<BR>
Playmate of the Rainbow-maiden.</P>
<P>"Now I praise the friends assembled,<BR>
All appear in graceful manners;<BR>
If the old are wise and silent,<BR>
All the youth are free and merry,<BR>
All the guests are fair and worthy.<BR>
Never was there in Wainola,<BR>
Never will there be in Northland,<BR>
Such a company assembled;<BR>
All the children speak in joyance,<BR>
All the aged move sedately;<BR>
Dressed in white are all the maidens,<BR>
Like the hoar-frost of the morning,<BR>
Like the welcome dawn of spring-time,<BR>
Like the rising of the daylight.<BR>
Silver then was more abundant,<BR>
Gold among the guests in plenty,<BR>
On the hills were money, pockets,<BR>
Money-bags along the valleys,<BR>
For the friends that were invited,<BR>
For the guests in joy assembled.<BR>
All the friends have now been lauded,<BR>
Each has gained his meed of honor."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Song-deliverer of Northland,<BR>
Swung himself upon the fur-bench<BR>
Or his magic sledge of copper,<BR>
Straightway hastened to his hamlet,<BR>
Singing as he journeyed onward,<BR>
Singing charms and incantations,<BR>
Singing one day, then a second,<BR>
All the third day chanting legends.<BR>
On the rocks the runners rattled,<BR>
Hung the sledge upon a birch-stump,<BR>
Broke it into many pieces,<BR>
With the magic of his singing;<BR>
Double were the runners bended,<BR>
All the parts were torn asunder,<BR>
And his magic sledge was ruined.</P>
<P>Then the good, old Wainamoinen<BR>
Spake these words in meditation:<BR>
"Is there one among this number,<BR>
In this rising generation,<BR>
Or perchance among the aged,<BR>
In the passing generation,<BR>
That will go to Mana's kingdom,<BR>
To the empire of Tuoni,<BR>
There to get the magic auger<BR>
From the master of Manala,<BR>
That I may repair my snow-sledge,<BR>
Or a second sledge may fashion?"</P>
<P>What the younger people answered<BR>
Was the answer of the aged:<BR>
"Not among the youth of Northland,<BR>
Nor among the aged heroes,<BR>
Is there one of ample courage,<BR>
That has bravery sufficient,<BR>
To attempt the reckless journey<BR>
To the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
To Manala's fields and castles,<BR>
Thence to bring Tuoni's auger,<BR>
Wherewithal to mend thy snow-sledge,<BR>
Build anew thy sledge of magic."</P>
<P>Thereupon old Wainamoinen,<BR>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<BR>
Went again to Mana's empire,<BR>
To the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
Crossed the sable stream of Deathland,<BR>
To the castles of Manala,<BR>
Found the auger of Tuoni,<BR>
Brought the instrument in safety.<BR>
Straightway sings old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Sings to life a purple forest,<BR>
In the forest, slender birches,<BR>
And beside them, mighty oak-trees,<BR>
Shapes them into shafts and runners,<BR>
Moulds them by his will and power,<BR>
Makes anew his sledge of magic.</P>
<P>On his steed he lays the harness,<BR>
Binds him to his sledge securely,<BR>
Seats himself upon the cross-bench,<BR>
And the racer gallops homeward,<BR>
To the manger filled and waiting,<BR>
To the stable of his master;<BR>
Brings the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Famous bard and wise enchanter,<BR>
To the threshold of his dwelling,<BR>
To his home in Kalevala.</P>
