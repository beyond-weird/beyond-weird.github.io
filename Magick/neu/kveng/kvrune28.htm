<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE MOTHER'S COUNSEL.</H1>
<P>AHTI, hero of the Islands,<BR>
Wild magician, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Also known as Kaukomieli,<BR>
Hastened from the great carousal,<BR>
From the banquet-halls of Louhi,<BR>
From the ever-darksome Northland,<BR>
From the dismal Sariola.<BR>
Stormful strode he from the mansion,<BR>
Hastened like the smoke of battle,<BR>
From the court-yard of Pohyola,<BR>
Left his crimes and misdemeanors<BR>
In the halls of ancient Louhi.<BR>
Then he looked in all directions,<BR>
Seeking for his tethered courser,<BR>
Anxious looked in field and stable,<BR>
But he did not find his racer;<BR>
Found a black thing in the fallow,<BR>
Proved to be a clump of willows.<BR>
Who will well advise the hero,<BR>
Who will give him wise directions,<BR>
Guide the wizard out of trouble,<BR>
Give his hero-locks protection,<BR>
Keep his magic head from danger<BR>
From the warriors of Northland?</P>
<P>Noise is beard within the village,<BR>
And a din from other homesteads,<BR>
From the battle-hosts of Louhi,<BR>
Streaming from the doors and window,<BR>
Of the homesteads of Pohyola.</P>
<P>Thereupon young Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome Islander and hero,<BR>
Changing both his form and features,<BR>
Clad himself in other raiment,<BR>
Changing to another body,<BR>
Quick became a mighty eagle,<BR>
Soared aloft on wings of magic,<BR>
Tried to fly to highest heaven,<BR>
But the moonlight burned his temples,<BR>
And the sunshine singed his feathers.</P>
<P>Then entreating, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Island-hero, turned to Ukko,<BR>
This the prayer that Ahti uttered:<BR>
"Ukko, God of love and mercy,<BR>
Thou the Wisdom of the heavens,<BR>
Wise Director of the lightning,<BR>
Thou the Author of the thunder,<BR>
Thou the Guide of all the cloudlets,<BR>
Give to me thy cloak of vapor,<BR>
Throw a silver cloud around me,<BR>
That I may in its protection<BR>
Hasten to my native country,<BR>
To my mother's Island-dwelling,<BR>
Fly to her that waits my coming,<BR>
With a mother's grave forebodings."</P>
<P>Farther, farther, Lemminkainen<BR>
Flew and soared on eagle-pinions,<BR>
Looked about him, backwards, forwards,<BR>
Spied a gray-hawk soaring near him,<BR>
In his eyes the fire of splendor,<BR>
Like the eyes of Pohyalanders,<BR>
Like the eyes of Pohya's spearmen,<BR>
And the gray-hawk thus addressed him:<BR>
"Ho! There! hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Art thou thinking of our combat<BR>
With the, hero-heads of Northland?"</P>
<P>Thus the Islander made answer,<BR>
These the words of Kaukomieli:<BR>
"O thou gray-hawk, bird of beauty,<BR>
Fly direct to Sariola,<BR>
Fly as fast as wings can bear thee;<BR>
When thou hast arrived in safety,<BR>
On the plains of darksome Northland,<BR>
Tell the archers and the spearmen,<BR>
They will never catch the eagle,<BR>
In his journey from Pohyola,<BR>
To his Island-borne and fortress."</P>
<P>Then the Ahti-eagle hastened<BR>
Straightway to his mother's cottage,<BR>
In his face the look of trouble,<BR>
In his heart the pangs of sorrow.<BR>
Ahti's mother ran to meet him,<BR>
When she spied him in the pathway,<BR>
Walking toward her island-dwelling;<BR>
These the words the mother uttered:<BR>
"Of my sons thou art the bravest,<BR>
Art the strongest of my children;<BR>
Wherefore then comes thine annoyance,<BR>
On returning from Pohyola?<BR>
Wert thou worsted at the banquet,<BR>
At the feast and great carousal?<BR>
At thy cups, if thou wert injured,<BR>
Thou shalt here have better treatment<BR>
Thou shalt have the cup thy father<BR>
Brought me from the hero-castle."<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Worthy mother, thou that nursed me,<BR>
If I had been maimed at drinking,<BR>
I the landlord would have worsted,<BR>
Would have slain a thousand heroes,<BR>
Would have taught them useful lessons."<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"Wherefore then art thou indignant,<BR>
Didst thou meet disgrace and insult,<BR>
Did they rob thee of thy courser?<BR>
Buy thou then a better courser<BR>
With the riches of thy mother,<BR>
With thy father's horded treasures."<BR>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Faithful mother of my being,<BR>
If my steed had been insulted,<BR>
If for him my heart was injured,<BR>
I the landlord would have punished,<BR>
Would have punished all the horsemen,<BR>
All of Pohya's strongest riders."<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"Tell me then thy dire misfortune,<BR>
What has happened to my hero,<BR>
On his journey to Pohyola?<BR>
Have the Northland maidens scorned thee,<BR>
Have the women ridiculed thee?<BR>
If the maidens scorned thy presence.<BR>
If the women gave derision,<BR>
There are others thou canst laugh at,<BR>
Thou canst scorn a thousand women."<BR>
Said the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Honored mother, fond and faithful,<BR>
If the Northland dames had scorned me<BR>
Or the maidens laughed derision,<BR>
I the maidens would have punished,<BR>
Would have scorned a thousand women."<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"Wherefore then are thou indignant,<BR>
Thus annoyed, and heavy-hearted,<BR>
On returning from Pohyola?<BR>
Was thy feasting out of season,<BR>
Was the banquet-beer unworthy,<BR>
Were thy dreams of evil import<BR>
When asleep in darksome Northland?"<BR>
This is Lemminkainen's answer:<BR>
"Aged women may remember<BR>
What they dream on beds of trouble;<BR>
I have seen some wondrous visions,<BR>
Since I left my Island-cottage.<BR>
My beloved, helpful mother,<BR>
Fill my bag with good provisions,<BR>
Flour and salt in great abundance,<BR>
Farther must thy hero wander,<BR>
He must leave his home behind him,<BR>
Leave his pleasant Island-dwelling,<BR>
Journey from this home of ages;<BR>
Men are sharpening their broadswords,<BR>
Sharpening their spears and lances,<BR>
For the death of Lemminkainen."</P>
<P>Then again the mother questioned,<BR>
Hurriedly she asked the reason:<BR>
"Why the men their swords were whetting,<BR>
Why their spears are being sharpened."</P>
<P>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Therefore do they whet their broadswords,<BR>
Therefore sharpen they their lances:<BR>
It is for thy son's destruction,<BR>
At his heart are aimed their lances.<BR>
In the court-yard of Pohyola,<BR>
There arose a great contention,<BR>
Fierce the battle waged against me;<BR>
But I slew the Northland hero,<BR>
Killed the host of Sariola;<BR>
Quick to arms rose Louhi's people,<BR>
All the spears and swords of Northland<BR>
Were directed at thy hero;<BR>
All of Pohya turned against me,<BR>
Turned against a single foeman."<BR>
This the answer of the mother:<BR>
"I had told thee this beforehand,<BR>
I had warned thee of this danger,<BR>
And forbidden thee to journey<BR>
To the hostile fields of Northland.<BR>
Here my hero could have lingered,<BR>
Passed his life in full contentment,<BR>
Lived forever with his mother,<BR>
With his mother for protection,<BR>
In the court-yard with his kindred;<BR>
Here no war would have arisen,<BR>
No contention would have followed.<BR>
Whither wilt thou go, my hero,<BR>
Whither will my loved one hasten,<BR>
To escape thy fierce pursuers,<BR>
To escape from thy misdoings,<BR>
From thy sins to bide in safety,<BR>
From thy crimes and misdemeanors,<BR>
That thy head be not endangered,<BR>
That thy body be not mangled,<BR>
That thy locks be not outrooted?"<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Know I not a spot befitting,<BR>
Do not know a place of safety,<BR>
Where to hide from my pursuers,<BR>
That will give me sure protection<BR>
From the crimes by me committed.<BR>
Helpful mother of my being,<BR>
Where to flee wilt thou advise me?"<BR>
This the answer of the mother:<BR>
"I do not know where I can send thee;<BR>
Be a pine-tree on the mountain,<BR>
Or a juniper in lowlands?<BR>
Then misfortune may befall thee;<BR>
Often is the mountain pine-tree<BR>
Cut in splints for candle-lighters;<BR>
And the juniper is often<BR>
Peeled for fence-posts for the pastures.<BR>
Go a birch-tree to the valleys,<BR>
Or an elm-tree to the glenwood?<BR>
Even then may trouble find thee,<BR>
Misery may overtake thee;<BR>
Often is the lowland birch-tree<BR>
Cut to pieces in the ware-house;<BR>
Often is the elm-wood forest<BR>
Cleared away for other plantings.<BR>
Be a berry on the highlands,<BR>
Cranberry upon the heather,<BR>
Strawberry upon the mountains,<BR>
Blackberry along the fences?<BR>
Even there will trouble find thee,<BR>
There misfortune overtake thee,<BR>
For the berry-maids would pluck thee,<BR>
Silver-tinselled girls would get thee.<BR>
Be a pike then in the ocean,<BR>
Or a troutlet in the rivers?<BR>
Then would trouble overtake thee,<BR>
Would become thy life-companion;<BR>
Then the fisherman would catch thee,<BR>
Catch thee in his net of flax-thread,<BR>
Catch thee with his cruel fish-hook.<BR>
Be a wolf then in the forest,<BR>
Or a black-bear in the thickets?<BR>
Even then would trouble find thee,<BR>
And disaster cross thy pathway;<BR>
Sable hunters of the Northland<BR>
Have their spears and cross-bows ready<BR>
To destroy the wolf and black-bear."<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Know I well the worst of places,<BR>
Know where Death will surely follow,<BR>
Where misfortune's eye would find me;<BR>
Since thou gavest me existence,<BR>
Gavest nourishment in childhood,<BR>
Whither shall I flee for safety,<BR>
Whither hide from death and danger?<BR>
In my view is fell destruction,<BR>
Dire misfortune 'hovers o'er me;<BR>
On the morrow come the spearmen,<BR>
Countless warriors from Pohya,<BR>
Ahti's head their satisfaction."<BR>
This the answer of the mother:<BR>
"I can name a goodly refuge,<BR>
Name a land of small dimensions,<BR>
Name a distant ocean-island,<BR>
Where my son may live in safety.<BR>
Thither archers never wander,<BR>
There thy head cannot be severed;<BR>
But an oath as strong as heaven,<BR>
Thou must swear before thy mother;<BR>
Thou wilt not for sixty summers<BR>
Join in war or deadly combat,<BR>
Even though thou wishest silver,<BR>
Wishest gold and silver treasures."<BR>
Spake the grateful Lemminkainen:<BR>
"I will swear an oath of honor,<BR>
That I'll not in sixty summers<BR>
Draw my sword in the arena,<BR>
Test the warrior in battle;<BR>
I have wounds upon my shoulders,<BR>
On my breast two scars of broadsword,<BR>
Of my former battles, relies,<BR>
Relies of my last encounters,<BR>
On the battle-fields of Northland,<BR>
In the wars with men and heroes."<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"Go thou, take thy father's vessel,<BR>
Go and bide thyself in safety,<BR>
Travel far across nine oceans;<BR>
In the tenth, sail to the centre,<BR>
To the island, forest-covered,<BR>
To the cliffs above the waters,<BR>
Where thy father went before thee,<BR>
Where he hid from his pursuers,<BR>
In the times of summer conquests,<BR>
In the darksome days of battle;<BR>
Good the isle for thee to dwell in,<BR>
Goodly place to live and linger;<BR>
Hide one year, and then a second,<BR>
In the third return in safety<BR>
To thy mother's island dwelling,<BR>
To thy father's ancient mansion,<BR>
To my hero's place of resting."</P>
