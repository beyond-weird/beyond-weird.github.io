<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">ILMARINEN'S WEDDING-FEAST.</H1>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Ancient dame of Sariola,<BR>
While at work within her dwelling,<BR>
Heard the whips crack on the fenlands,<BR>
Heard the rattle of the sledges;<BR>
To the northward turned her glances,<BR>
Turned her vision to the sunlight,<BR>
And her thoughts ran on as follow:<BR>
"Who are these in bright apparel,<BR>
On the banks of Pohya-waters,<BR>
Are they friends or hostile armies?"</P>
<P>Then the hostess of the Northland<BR>
Looked again and well considered,<BR>
Drew much nearer to examine,<BR>
Found they were not hostile armies,<BR>
Found that they were friends and suitors.<BR>
In the midst was Ilmarinen,<BR>
Son-in-law to ancient Louhi.</P>
<P>When the hostess of Pohyola<BR>
Saw the son-in-law approaching<BR>
She addressed the words that follow:<BR>
"I had thought the winds were raging,<BR>
That the piles of wood were falling,<BR>
Thought the pebbles in commotion,<BR>
Or perchance the ocean roaring;<BR>
Then I hastened nearer, nearer,<BR>
Drew still nearer and examined,<BR>
Found the winds were not in battle,<BR>
Found the piles of wood unshaken,<BR>
Found the ocean was not roaring,<BR>
Nor the pebbles in commotion,<BR>
Found my son-in-law was coming<BR>
With his heroes and attendants,<BR>
Heroes counted by the hundreds.</P>
<P>"Should you ask of me the question,<BR>
How I recognized the bridegroom<BR>
Mid the hosts of men and heroes,<BR>
I should answer, I should tell you:<BR>
'As the hazel-bush in copses,<BR>
As the oak-tree in the forest,<BR>
As the Moon among the planets;<BR>
Drives the groom a coal-black courser,<BR>
Running like the famished black-dog,<BR>
Flying like the hungry raven,<BR>
Graceful as the lark at morning,<BR>
Golden cuckoos, six in number,<BR>
Twitter on the birchen cross-bow;<BR>
There are seven bluebirds singing<BR>
On the racer's hame and collar."</P>
<P>Noises hear they in the court-yard,<BR>
On the highway hear the sledges,<BR>
To the court comes Ilmarinen,<BR>
With his body-guard of heroes;<BR>
In the midst the chosen suitor,<BR>
Not too far in front of others,<BR>
Not too far behind his fellows.<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Hie ye hither, men and heroes,<BR>
Haste, ye watchers, to the stables,<BR>
There unhitch the suitor's stallion,<BR>
Lower well the racer's breast-plate,<BR>
There undo the straps and buckles,<BR>
Loosen well the shafts and traces,<BR>
And conduct the suitor hither,<BR>
Give my son-in-law good welcome!"</P>
<P>Ilmarinen turned his racer<BR>
Into Louhi's yard and stables,<BR>
And descended from his snow-sledge.<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Come, thou servant of my bidding,<BR>
Best of all my trusted servants,<BR>
Take at once the bridegroom's courser<BR>
From the shafts adorned with silver,<BR>
From the curving arch of willow,<BR>
Lift the harness trimmed in copper,<BR>
Tie the white-face to the manger,<BR>
Treat the suitor's steed with kindness,<BR>
Lead him carefully to shelter<BR>
By his soft and shining bridle,<BR>
By his halter tipped with silver;<BR>
Let him roll among the sand-hills,<BR>
On the bottoms soft and even,<BR>
On the borders of the snow-banks,<BR>
In the fields of milky color.</P>
<P>"Lead the hero's steed to water,<BR>
Lead him to the Pohya-fountains,<BR>
Where the living streams are flowing,<BR>
Sweet as milk of human kindness,<BR>
From the roots of silvery birches,<BR>
Underneath the shade of aspens.</P>
<P>"Feed the courser of the suitor,<BR>
On the sweetest corn and barley,<BR>
On the summer-wheat and clover,<BR>
In the caldron steeped in sweetness;<BR>
Feed him at the golden manger,<BR>
In the boxes lined with copper,<BR>
At my manger richly furnished,<BR>
In the warmest of the stables;<BR>
Tie him with a silk-like halter,<BR>
To the golden rings and staples,<BR>
To the hooks of purest silver,<BR>
Set in beams of birch and oak-wood;<BR>
Feed him on the hay the sweetest,<BR>
Feed him on the corn nutritious,<BR>
Give the best my barns can furnish.</P>
<P>"Curry well the suitor's courser<BR>
With the curry-comb of fish-bone,<BR>
Brush his hair with silken brushes,<BR>
Put his mane and tail in order,<BR>
Cover well with flannel blankets,<BR>
Blankets wrought in gold and silver,<BR>
Buckles forged from shining copper.</P>
<P>"Come, ye small lads of the village,<BR>
Lead the suitor to my chambers,<BR>
With your auburn locks uncovered,<BR>
From your hands remove your mittens,<BR>
See if ye can lead the hero<BR>
Through the door without his stooping,<BR>
Lifting not the upper cross-bar,<BR>
Lowering not the oaken threshold,<BR>
Moving not the birchen casings,<BR>
Great the hero who must enter.</P>
<P>"Ilmarinen is too stately,<BR>
Cannot enter through the portals,<BR>
Not the son-in-law and bridegroom,<BR>
Till the portals have been heightened;<BR>
Taller by a head the suitor<BR>
Than the door-ways of the mansion."</P>
<P>Quick the servants of Pohyola<BR>
Tore away the upper cross-bar,<BR>
That his cap might not be lifted;<BR>
Made the oaken threshold lower<BR>
That the hero might not stumble;<BR>
Made the birch-wood portals wider,<BR>
Opened full the door of welcome,<BR>
Easy entrance for the suitor.</P>
<P>Speaks the hostess of the Northland<BR>
As the bridegroom freely passes<BR>
Through the doorway of her dwelling:<BR>
"Thanks are due to thee, O Ukko,<BR>
That my son-in-law has entered!<BR>
Let me now my halls examine;<BR>
Make the bridal chambers ready,<BR>
Finest linen on my tables,<BR>
Softest furs upon my benches,<BR>
Birchen flooring scrubbed to whiteness,<BR>
All my rooms in perfect order."</P>
<P>Then the hostess of Pohyola<BR>
Visited her spacious dwelling,<BR>
Did not recognize her chambers;<BR>
Every room had been remodeled,<BR>
Changed by force of mighty magic;<BR>
All the halls were newly burnished,<BR>
Hedge-hog bones were used for ceilings,<BR>
Bones of reindeer for foundations,<BR>
Bones of wolverine for door-sills,<BR>
For the cross-bars bones of roebuck,<BR>
Apple-wood were all the rafters,<BR>
Alder-wood, the window-casings,<BR>
Scales of trout adorned the windows,<BR>
And the fires were set in flowers.<BR>
All the seats were made of silver,<BR>
All the floors of copper-tiling,<BR>
Gold-adorned were all the tables,<BR>
On the floor were silken mattings,<BR>
Every fire-place set in copper,<BR>
Every hearth-stone cut from marble,<BR>
On each shelf were colored sea-shells,<BR>
Kalew's tree was their protection.</P>
<P>To the court-room came the hero,<BR>
Chosen suitor from Wainola,<BR>
These the words of Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Send, O Ukko, health and pleasure<BR>
To this ancient home and dwelling,<BR>
To this mansion richly fashioned!"<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Let thy coming be auspicious<BR>
To these halls of thee unworthy,<BR>
To the home of thine affianced,<BR>
To this dwelling lowly fashioned,<BR>
Mid the lindens and the aspens.</P>
<P>"Come, ye maidens that should serve me,<BR>
Come, ye fellows from the village,<BR>
Bring me fire upon the birch-bark,<BR>
Light the fagots of the fir-tree,<BR>
That I may behold the bridegroom,<BR>
Chosen suitor of my daughter,<BR>
Fairy Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
See the color of his eyeballs,<BR>
Whether they are blue or sable,<BR>
See if they are warm and faithful."</P>
<P>Quick the young lads from the village<BR>
Brought the fire upon the birch-bark,<BR>
Brought it on the tips of pine-wood;<BR>
And the fire and smoke commingled<BR>
Roll and roar about the hero,<BR>
Blackening the suitor's visage,<BR>
And the hostess speaks as follows;<BR>
"Bring the fire upon a taper,<BR>
On the waxen tapers bring it!"</P>
<P>Then the maidens did as bidden,<BR>
Quickly brought the lighted tapers,<BR>
Made the suitor's eyeballs glisten,<BR>
Made his cheeks look fresh and ruddy;<BR>
Made his eyes of sable color<BR>
Sparkle like the foam of waters,<BR>
Like the reed-grass on the margin,<BR>
Colored as the ocean jewels,<BR>
Iridescent as the rainbow.</P>
<P>"Come, ye fellows of the hamlet,<BR>
Lead my son-in-law and hero<BR>
To the highest seat at table,<BR>
To the seat of greatest honor,<BR>
With his back upon the blue-wall,<BR>
Looking on my bounteous tables,<BR>
Facing all the guests of Northland."</P>
<P>Then the hostess of Pohyola<BR>
Served her guests in great abundance,<BR>
Richest drinks and rarest viands,<BR>
First of all she, served the bridegroom<BR>
On his platters, honeyed biscuit,<BR>
And the sweetest river salmon,<BR>
Seasoned butter, roasted bacon,<BR>
All the dainties of Pohyola.<BR>
Then the helpers served the others,<BR>
Filled the plates of all invited<BR>
With the varied food of Northland.<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Come, ye maidens from the village,<BR>
Hither bring the beer in pitchers,<BR>
In the urns with double handles,<BR>
To the many guests in-gathered,<BR>
Ere all others, serve the bridegroom."</P>
<P>Thereupon the merry maidens<BR>
Brought the beer in silver pitchers<BR>
From the copper-banded vessels,<BR>
For the wedding-guests assembled;<BR>
And the beer, fermenting, sparkled<BR>
On the beard of Ilmarinen,<BR>
On the beards of many heroes.</P>
<P>When the guests had all partaken<BR>
Of the wondrous beer of barley,<BR>
Spake the beer in merry accents<BR>
Through the tongues of the magicians,<BR>
Through the tongue of many a hero,<BR>
Through the tongue of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Famed to be the sweetest singer<BR>
Of the Northland bards and minstrels,<BR>
These the words of the enchanter:<BR>
"O thou beer of honeyed flavor,<BR>
Let us not imbibe in silence,<BR>
Let some hero sing thy praises,<BR>
Sing thy worth in golden measures;<BR>
Let the hostess start the singing,<BR>
Let the bridegroom sound thy virtues!<BR>
Have our songs thus quickly vanished,<BR>
Have our joyful tongues grown silent?<BR>
Evil then has been the brewing,<BR>
Then the beer must be unworthy,<BR>
That it does not cheer the singer,<BR>
Does not move the merry minstrel,<BR>
That the golden guests are joyless,<BR>
And the cuckoo is not singing.<BR>
Never will these benches echo<BR>
Till the bench-guests chant thy virtues;<BR>
Nor the floor resound thy praises<BR>
Till the floor-guests sing in concord;<BR>
Nor the windows join the chorus<BR>
Till the window-guests have spoken;<BR>
All the tables will keep silence<BR>
Till the heroes toast thy virtues;<BR>
Little singing from the chimney<BR>
Till the chimney-guests have chanted."</P>
<P>On the floor a child was sitting,<BR>
Thus the little boy made answer:<BR>
"I am small and young in singing,<BR>
Have perchance but little wisdom;<BR>
Be that as it may, my seniors,<BR>
Since the elder minstrels sing not,<BR>
Nor the heroes chant their legends,<BR>
Nor the hostess lead the singing,<BR>
I will sing my simple stories,<BR>
Sing my little store of knowledge,<BR>
To the pleasure of the evening,<BR>
To the joy of the invited."</P>
<P>Near the fire reclined an old man,<BR>
And the gray-beard thus made answer:<BR>
"Not the time for children's singing,<BR>
Children's wisdom is too ready,<BR>
Children's songs are filled with trifles,<BR>
Filled with shrewd and vain deceptions,<BR>
Maiden-songs are full of follies;<BR>
Leave the songs and incantations<BR>
To the ancient wizard-singers;<BR>
Leave the tales of times primeval<BR>
To the minstrel of Wainola,<BR>
To the hero of the Northland,<BR>
To the, ancient Wainamoinen."<BR>
Thereupon Osmoinen answered:<BR>
"Are there not some sweeter singers<BR>
In this honored congregation,<BR>
That will clasp their hands together,<BR>
Sing the ancient songs unbroken,<BR>
Thus begin the incantations,<BR>
Make these ancient halls re-echo<BR>
For the pleasure of the evening,<BR>
For the joy of the in-gathered?"<BR>
From the hearth-stone spake, the gray-beard<BR>
"Not a singer of Pohyola,<BR>
Not a minstrel, nor magician,<BR>
That was better skilled in chanting<BR>
Legends of the days departed,<BR>
Than was I when I was singing,<BR>
In my years of vain ambition;<BR>
Then I chanted tales of heroes,<BR>
On the blue back of the waters,<BR>
Sang the ballads of my people,<BR>
In the vales and on the mountains,<BR>
Through the verdant fields and forests;<BR>
Sweet my voice and skilled my singing,<BR>
All my songs were highly lauded,<BR>
Rippled like the quiet rivers,<BR>
Easy-flowing like the waters,<BR>
Easy-gliding as the snow-shoes,<BR>
Like the ship upon the ocean.</P>
<P>"Woe is me, my days are ended,<BR>
Would not recognize my singing,<BR>
All its sweetness gone to others,<BR>
Flows no more like rippling waters,<BR>
Makes no more the hills re-echo!<BR>
Now my songs are full of discord,<BR>
Like the rake upon the stubble,<BR>
Like the sledge upon the gravel,<BR>
Like the boat upon the sea-shore!"</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Spake these words in magic measures:<BR>
"Since no other bard appeareth<BR>
That will clasp my hand in singing,<BR>
I will sing some simple legends,<BR>
Sing my, garnered store of wisdom,<BR>
Make these magic halls re-echo<BR>
With my tales of ancient story,<BR>
Since a bard I was created,<BR>
Born an orator and singer;<BR>
Do not ask the ways of others,<BR>
Follow not the paths of strangers."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, famous minstrel,<BR>
Song's eternal, wise supporter,<BR>
Then began the songs of pleasure,<BR>
Made the halls resound with joyance,<BR>
Filled the rooms with wondrous singing;<BR>
Sang the ancient bard-magician<BR>
All the oldest wisdom-sayings,<BR>
Did not fail in voice nor legends,<BR>
All the wisest thoughts remembered.</P>
<P>Thus the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Sang the joy of all assembled,<BR>
To the pleasure of the evening,<BR>
To the merriment of maidens,<BR>
To the happiness of heroes;<BR>
All the guests were stilled in wonder<BR>
At the magic of his singing,<BR>
At the songs of the magician.</P>
<P>Spake again wise Wainamoinen,<BR>
When his wonder-tales had ended:<BR>
"l have little worth or power,<BR>
Am a bard of little value,<BR>
Little consequence my singing,<BR>
Mine abilities as nothing,<BR>
If but Ukko, my Creator,<BR>
Should intone his wisdom-sayings,<BR>
Sing the source of good and evil,<BR>
Sing the origin of matter,<BR>
Sing the legends of omniscience,<BR>
Sing his songs in full perfection.<BR>
God could sing the floods to honey,<BR>
Sing the sands to ruddy berries,<BR>
Sing the pebbles into barley,<BR>
Sing to beer the running waters,<BR>
Sing to salt the rocks of ocean,<BR>
Into corn-fields sing the forests,<BR>
Into gold the forest-fruitage,<BR>
Sing to bread the hills and mountains,<BR>
Sing to eggs the rounded sandstones;<BR>
He could touch the springs of magic,<BR>
He could turn the keys of nature,<BR>
And produce within thy pastures,<BR>
Hurdles filled with sheep and reindeer,<BR>
Stables filled with fleet-foot stallions,<BR>
Kine in every field and fallow;<BR>
Sing a fur-robe for the bridegroom,<BR>
For the bride a coat of ermine,<BR>
For the hostess, shoes of silver,<BR>
For the hero, mail of copper.</P>
<P>"Grant O Ukko, my Creator,<BR>
God of love, and truth, and justice,<BR>
Grant thy blessing on our feasting,<BR>
Bless this company assembled,<BR>
For the good of Sariola,<BR>
For the happiness of Northland!<BR>
May this bread and beer bring joyance,<BR>
May they come in rich abundance,<BR>
May they carry full contentment<BR>
To the people of Pohyola,<BR>
To the cabin and the mansion;<BR>
May the hours we spend in singing,<BR>
In the morning, in the evening,<BR>
Fill our hearts with joy and gladness!<BR>
Hear us in our supplications,<BR>
Grant to us thy needed blessings,<BR>
Send enjoyment, health, and comfort,<BR>
To the people here assembled,<BR>
To the host and to the hostess,<BR>
To the bride and to the bridegroom,<BR>
To the sons upon the waters,<BR>
To the daughters at their weavings,<BR>
To the hunters on the mountains,<BR>
To the shepherds in the fenlands,<BR>
That our lives may end in honor,<BR>
That we may recall with pleasure<BR>
Ilmarinen's magic marriage<BR>
To the Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Snow-white virgin of the Northland."</P>
