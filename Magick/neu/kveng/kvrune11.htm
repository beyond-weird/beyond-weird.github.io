<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">LEMMINKAINEN'S LAMENT.</H1>
<P>THIS the time to sing of Ahti,<BR>
Son of Lempo, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Also known as Lemminkainen.<BR>
Ahti was the king of islands,<BR>
Grew amid the island-dwellings,<BR>
At the site of his dear mother,<BR>
On the borders of the ocean,<BR>
On the points of promontories.<BR>
Ahti fed upon the salmon,<BR>
Fed upon the ocean whiting,<BR>
Thus became a mighty hero,<BR>
In his veins the blood of ages,<BR>
Read erect and form commanding,<BR>
Growth of mind and body perfect<BR>
But alas! he had his failings,<BR>
Bad indeed his heart and morals,<BR>
Roaming in unworthy places,<BR>
Staying days and nights in sequences<BR>
At the homes of merry maidens,<BR>
At the dances of the virgins,<BR>
With the maids of braided tresses.</P>
<P>Up in Sahri lived a maiden,<BR>
Lived the fair and winsome Kulli,<BR>
Lovely as a summer-flower,<BR>
From a kingly house descended,<BR>
Grew to perfect form and beauty,<BR>
Living in her father's cottage,<BR>
Home of many ancient heroes,<BR>
Beautiful was she and queenly,<BR>
Praised throughout the whole of Ehstland;<BR>
From afar men came to woo her,<BR>
To the birthplace of the virgin,<BR>
To the household of her mother.</P>
<P>For his son the Day-star wooes her,<BR>
But she will not go to Sun-land,<BR>
Will not shine beside the Day-star,<BR>
In his haste to bring the summer.<BR>
For her son, the bright Moon wooes her,<BR>
But she will not go to Moon-land,<BR>
By the bright Moon will not glimmer,<BR>
Will not run through boundless ether.</P>
<P>For his son the Night-star wooes her,<BR>
But she will not go to Star-land,<BR>
Will not twinkle in the starlight,<BR>
Through the dreary nights in winter.</P>
<P>Lovers come from distant Ehstlaud,<BR>
Others come from far-off Ingern,<BR>
But they cannot win the maiden,<BR>
This the answer that she gives them<BR>
"Vainly are your praises lavished<BR>
Vainly is your silver offered,<BR>
Wealth and praise are no temptation;<BR>
Never shall I go to Ehstland,<BR>
Never shall I go a-rowing<BR>
On the waters of the Ingern,<BR>
Shall not cross the Sahri-waters,<BR>
Never eat the fish of Ehstland,<BR>
Never taste the Ehstland viands.<BR>
Ingerland shall never see me,<BR>
Will not row upon her rivers,<BR>
Will not step within her borders;<BR>
Hunger there, and fell starvation,<BR>
Wood is absent, fuel wanting,<BR>
Neither water, wheat, nor barley,<BR>
Even rye is not abundant."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen of the islands,<BR>
Warlike hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Undertakes to win the maiden,<BR>
Woo and win the Sahri-flower,<BR>
Win a bride so highly honored,<BR>
Win the maid with golden tresses,<BR>
Win the Sahri maid of beauty;<BR>
But his mother gives him warning:<BR>
"Nay," replies his gray-haired mother,<BR>
"Do not woo, my son beloved,<BR>
Maiden of a higher station;<BR>
She will never make thee happy<BR>
With her lineage of Sahri."</P>
<P>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
These the words of Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Should I come from lowly station,<BR>
Though my tribe is not the highest,<BR>
I shall woo to please my fancy,<BR>
Woo the maiden fair and lovely,<BR>
Choose a wife for worth and beauty."<BR>
This the anxious mother's answer:<BR>
"Lemminkainen, son beloved,<BR>
Listen to advice maternal:<BR>
Do not go to distant Sahri,<BR>
To her tribe of many branches;<BR>
All the maidens there will taunt thee,<BR>
All the women will deride thee."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, little hearing,<BR>
Answers thus his mother's pleading:<BR>
"I will still the sneers of women,<BR>
Silence all the taunts of maidens,<BR>
I will crush their haughty bosoms,<BR>
Smite the hands and cheeks of infants;<BR>
Surely this will check their insults,<BR>
Fitting ending to derision!"<BR>
This the answer of' the mother:<BR>
"Woe is me, my son beloved!<BR>
Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<BR>
Shouldst thou taunt the Sahri daughters.<BR>
Or insult the maids of virtue,<BR>
Shouldst thou laugh them to derision,<BR>
There will rise a great contention,<BR>
Fierce the battle that will follow.<BR>
All the hosts of Sahri-suitors,<BR>
Armed in thousands will attack thee,<BR>
And will slay thee for thy folly."</P>
<P>Nothing listing, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Heeding not his mother's warning,<BR>
Led his war-horse from the stables,<BR>
Quickly hitched the fiery charger,<BR>
Fleetly drove upon his journey,<BR>
To the distant Sahri-village,<BR>
There to woo the Sahri-flower,<BR>
There to win the Bride of Beauty.</P>
<P>All the aged Sahri-women,<BR>
All the young and lovely maidens<BR>
Laughed to scorn the coming stranger<BR>
Driving careless through the alleys,<BR>
Wildly driving through the court-yard,<BR>
Now upsetting in the gate-way,<BR>
Breaking shaft, and hame, and runner.</P>
<P>Then the fearless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Mouth awry and visage wrinkled,<BR>
Shook his sable locks and answered:<BR>
"Never in my recollection<BR>
Have I heard or seen such treatment,<BR>
Never have I been derided,<BR>
Never suffered sneers of women,<BR>
Never suffered scorn of virgins,<BR>
Not in my immortal life-time.<BR>
Is there any place befitting<BR>
On the Sahri-plains and pastures,<BR>
Where to join in songs and dances?<BR>
Is there here a hall for pleasure,<BR>
Where the Sahri-maidens linger,<BR>
Merry maids with braided tresses?"</P>
<P>Thereupon the Sahri-maidens<BR>
Answered from their promontory.,<BR>
"Room enough is there in Sahri,<BR>
Room upon the Sahri-pastures,<BR>
Room for pleasure-halls and dances;<BR>
Sing and dance upon our meadows,<BR>
Be a shepherd on the mountains,<BR>
Shepherd-boys have room for dancing;<BR>
Indolent the Sahri-children,<BR>
But the colts are fat and frisky."</P>
<P>Little caring, Lemminkainen<BR>
Entered service there as shepherd,<BR>
In the daytime on the pastures,<BR>
In the evening, making merry<BR>
At the games of lively maidens,<BR>
At the dances with the virgins,<BR>
With the maids with braided tresses.<BR>
Thus it was that Lemminkainen,<BR>
Thus the shepherd, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Quickly hushed the women's laughter,<BR>
Quickly quenched the taunts of maidens,<BR>
Quickly silenced their derision.<BR>
All the dames and Sahri-daughters<BR>
Soon were feasting Lemminkainen,<BR>
At his side they danced and lingered.<BR>
Only was there one among them,<BR>
One among the Sahri-virgins,<BR>
Harbored neither love nor wooers,<BR>
Favored neither gods nor heroes,<BR>
This the lovely maid Kyllikki,<BR>
This the Sahri's fairest flower.<BR>
Lemminkainen, full of pleasure,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Rowed a hundred boats in pieces,<BR>
Pulled a thousand oars to fragments,<BR>
While he wooed the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
Tried to win the fair Kyllikki.</P>
<P>Finally the lovely maiden,<BR>
Fairest daughter of the Northland,<BR>
Thus addresses Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Why dost linger here, thou weak one,<BR>
Why dost murmur on these borders,<BR>
Why come wooing at my fireside,<BR>
Wooing me in belt of copper?<BR>
Have no time to waste upon thee,<BR>
Rather give this stone its polish,<BR>
Rather would I turn the pestle<BR>
In the heavy sandstone mortar;<BR>
Rather sit beside my mother<BR>
In the dwellings of my father.<BR>
Never shall I heed thy wooing,<BR>
Neither wights nor whisks I care for,<BR>
Sooner have a slender husband<BR>
Since I have a slender body;<BR>
Wish to have him fine of figure,<BR>
Since perchance I am well-shapen;<BR>
Wish to have him tall and stately,<BR>
Since my form perchance is queenly;<BR>
Never waste thy time in wooing<BR>
Saliri's maid and favored flower."</P>
<P>Time had gone but little distance,<BR>
Scarcely had a month passed over,<BR>
When upon a merry evening,<BR>
Where the maidens meet for dancing,<BR>
In the glen beyond the meadow,<BR>
On a level patch of verdure,<BR>
Came too soon the maid Kyllikki,<BR>
Sahri's pride, the Maid of Beauty;<BR>
Quickly followed Lemminkainen,<BR>
With his stallion proudly prancing,<BR>
Fleetest racer of the Northland,<BR>
Fleetly drives beyond the meadow,<BR>
Where the maidens meet for dancing,<BR>
Snatches quick the maid Kyllikki,<BR>
On the settle seats the maiden,<BR>
Quickly draws the leathern cover,<BR>
And adjusts the brichen cross-bar,<BR>
Whips his courser to a gallop.<BR>
With a rush, and roar, and rattle,<BR>
Speeds he homeward like the storm-wind,<BR>
Speaks these words to those that listen:<BR>
"Never, never, anxious maidens,<BR>
Must ye give the information,<BR>
That I carried off Kyllikki<BR>
To my distant home and kindred.<BR>
If ye do not heed this order,<BR>
Ye shall badly fare as maidens;<BR>
I shall sing to war your suitors,<BR>
Sing them under spear and broadsword,<BR>
That for months, and years, and ages,<BR>
Never ye will see their faces,<BR>
Never hear their merry voices,<BR>
Never will they tread these uplands,<BR>
Never will they join these dances,<BR>
Never will they drive these highways."</P>
<P>Sad the wailing of Kyllikki,<BR>
Sad the weeping flower of Sahri!<BR>
Listen to her tearful pleading:<BR>
"Give, O give me back my freedom,<BR>
Free me from the throes of thralldom,<BR>
Let this maiden wander homeward,<BR>
By some foot-path let me wander<BR>
To my father who is grieving,<BR>
To my mother who is weeping;<BR>
Let me go or I will curse thee!<BR>
If thou wilt not give me freedom,<BR>
Wilt not let me wander homeward,<BR>
Where my loved ones wait my coming,<BR>
I have seven stalwart brothers,<BR>
Seven sons of father's brother,<BR>
Seven sons of mother's sister,<BR>
Who pursue the tracks of red-deer,<BR>
Hunt the hare upon the heather;<BR>
They will follow thee and slay thee,<BR>
Thus I'll gain my wished-for freedom."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, little heeding,<BR>
Would not grant the maiden's wishes,<BR>
Would not heed her plea for mercy.<BR>
Spake again the waiting virgin,<BR>
Pride and beauty of the Northland:<BR>
"Joyful was I with my kindred,<BR>
Joyful born and softly nurtured<BR>
Merrily I spent my childhood,<BR>
Happy I, in virgin-freedom,<BR>
In the dwelling of my father,<BR>
By the bedside of my mother,<BR>
With my lineage in Sahri;<BR>
But alas! all joy has vanished,<BR>
All my happiness departed,<BR>
All my maiden beauty waneth<BR>
Since I met thine evil spirit,<BR>
Shameless hero of dishonor,<BR>
Cruel fighter of the islands,<BR>
Merciless in civil combat."</P>
<P>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
These the words of Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Dearest maiden, fair Kyllikki,<BR>
My sweet strawberry of Pohya,<BR>
Still thine anguish, cease thy weeping,<BR>
Be thou free from care and sorrow,<BR>
Never shall I do thee evil,<BR>
Never will my hands maltreat thee,<BR>
Never will mine arms abuse thee,<BR>
Never will my tongue revile thee,<BR>
Never will my heart deceive thee.</P>
<P>"Tell me why thou hast this anguish,<BR>
Why thou hast this bitter sorrow,<BR>
Why this sighing and lamenting,<BR>
Tell me why this wail of sadness?<BR>
Banish all thy cares and sorrows,<BR>
Dry thy tears and still thine anguish,<BR>
I have cattle, food, and shelter,<BR>
I have home, and friends, and kindred,<BR>
Kine upon the plains and uplands,<BR>
In the marshes berries plenty,<BR>
Strawberries upon the mountains<BR>
I have kine that need no milking,<BR>
Handsome kine that need no feeding,<BR>
Beautiful if not well-tended;<BR>
Need not tie them up at evening,<BR>
Need not free them in the morning,<BR>
Need not hunt them, need not feed them,<BR>
Need not give them salt nor water.</P>
<P>"Thinkest thou my race is lowly,<BR>
Dost thou think me born ignoble,<BR>
Does my lineage agrieve thee?<BR>
Was not born in lofty station,<BR>
From a tribe of noble heroes,<BR>
From a worthy race descended;<BR>
But I have a sword of fervor,<BR>
And a spear yet filled with courage,<BR>
Surely these are well descended,<BR>
These were born from hero-races,<BR>
Sharpened by the mighty Hisi,<BR>
By the gods were forged and burnished;<BR>
Therefore will I give thee greatness,<BR>
Greatness of my race and nation,<BR>
With my broadsword filled with fervor,<BR>
With my spear still filled with courage."</P>
<P>Anxiously the sighing maiden<BR>
Thus addresses Lemminkainen:<BR>
"O thou Ahti, son of Lempo,<BR>
Wilt thou take this trusting virgin,<BR>
As thy faithful life-companion,<BR>
Take me under thy protection,<BR>
Be to me a faithful husband,<BR>
Swear to me an oath of honor,<BR>
That thou wilt not go to battle,<BR>
When for gold thou hast a longing,<BR>
When thou wishest gold and silver?"<BR>
This is Lemminkainen's answer:<BR>
I will swear an oath of honor,<BR>
That I'll never go to battle,<BR>
When for gold I feel a longing,<BR>
When I wish for gold and silver.<BR>
Swear thou also on thine honor,<BR>
Thou wilt go not to the village,<BR>
When desire for dance impels thee,<BR>
Wilt not visit village-dances."</P>
<P>Thus the two made oath together,<BR>
Registered their vows in heaven,<BR>
Vowed before omniscient Ukko,<BR>
Ne'er to go to war vowed Ahti,<BR>
Never to the dance, Kyllikki.</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, full of joyance,<BR>
Snapped his whip above his courser,<BR>
Whipped his racer to a gallop,<BR>
And these words the hero uttered:<BR>
"Fare ye well, ye Sahri-meadows,<BR>
Roots of firs, and stumps of birch-trees.<BR>
That I wandered through in summer,<BR>
That I travelled o'er in winter,<BR>
Where ofttimes in rainy seasons,<BR>
At the evening hour I lingered,<BR>
When I sought to win the virgin,<BR>
Sought to win the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
Fairest of the Sahri-flowers.<BR>
Fare ye well, ye Sahri-woodlands,<BR>
Seas and oceans, lakes and rivers,<BR>
Vales and mountains, isles and inlets,<BR>
Once the home of fair Kyllikki!"</P>
<P>Quick the racer galloped homeward,<BR>
Galloped on along the highway,<BR>
Toward the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
To the plains of Kalevala.</P>
<P>As they neared the Ahti-dwellings,<BR>
Thus Kyllikki spake in sorrow:<BR>
"Cold and drear is thy cottage,<BR>
Seeming like a place deserted;<BR>
Who may own this dismal cabin,<BR>
Who the one so little honored?"</P>
<P>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
These the words that Ahti uttered:<BR>
"Do not grieve about my cottage,<BR>
Have no care about my chambers;<BR>
I shall build thee other dwellings,<BR>
I shall fashion them much better,<BR>
Beams, and posts, and sills, and rafters,<BR>
Fashioned from the sacred birch-wood."</P>
<P>Now they reach the home of Ahti,<BR>
Lemminkainen's home and birthplace,<BR>
Enter they his mother's cottage;<BR>
There they meet his aged mother,<BR>
These the words the mother uses:<BR>
"Long indeed hast thou been absent,<BR>
Long in foreign lands hast wandered,<BR>
Long in Sahri thou hast lingered!"<BR>
This is Lemminkainen's answer:<BR>
"All the host of Sahri-women,<BR>
All the chaste and lovely maidens,<BR>
All the maids with braided tresses,<BR>
Well have paid for their derision,<BR>
For their scorn and for their laughter,<BR>
That they basely heaped upon me.<BR>
I have brought the best among them<BR>
In my sledge to this thy cottage;<BR>
Well I wrapped her in my fur-robes,<BR>
Kept her warm enwrapped in bear-skin,<BR>
Brought her to my mother's dwelling,<BR>
As my faithful life-companion;<BR>
Thus I paid the scornful maidens,<BR>
Paid them well for their derision.</P>
<P>"Cherished mother of my being,<BR>
I have found the long-sought jewel,<BR>
I have won the Maid of Beauty.<BR>
Spread our couch with finest linen,<BR>
For our heads the softest pillows,<BR>
On our table rarest viands,<BR>
So that I may dwell in pleasure<BR>
With my spouse, the bride of honor,<BR>
With the pride of distant Sahri."<BR>
This the answer of the mother:<BR>
"Be thou praised, O gracious Ukko,<BR>
Loudly praised, O thou Creator,<BR>
Since thou givest me a daughter,<BR>
Ahti's bride, my second daughter,<BR>
Who can stir the fire at evening,<BR>
Who can weave me finest fabrics,<BR>
Who can twirl the useful spindle,<BR>
Who can rinse my silken ribbons,<BR>
Who can full the richest garments.</P>
<P>"Son beloved, praise thy Maker,<BR>
For the winning of this virgin,<BR>
Pride and joy of distant Sahri<BR>
Kind indeed is thy Creator,<BR>
Wise the ever-knowing Ukko!<BR>
Pure the snow upon the mountains,<BR>
Purer still thy Bride of Beauty;<BR>
White the foam upon the ocean,<BR>
Whiter still her virgin-spirit;<BR>
Graceful on the lakes, the white-swan,<BR>
Still more graceful, thy companion:<BR>
Beautiful the stars in heaven,<BR>
Still more beautiful, Kyllikki.<BR>
Larger make our humble cottage,<BR>
Wider build the doors and windows,<BR>
Fashion thou the ceilings higher,<BR>
Decorate the walls in beauty,<BR>
Now that thou a bride hast taken<BR>
From a tribe of higher station,<BR>
Purest maiden of creation,<BR>
From the meadow-lands of Sahri,<BR>
From the upper shores of Northland."</P>
