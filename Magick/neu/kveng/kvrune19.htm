<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">ILMARINEN'S WOOING.</H1>
<P>ILMARINEN, hero-blacksmith,<BR>
The eternal metal-worker,<BR>
Hastens forward to the court-room<BR>
Of the hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Of the master of the Northland,<BR>
Hastens through the open portals<BR>
Into Louhi's home and presence.<BR>
Servants come with silver pitchers,<BR>
Filled with Northland's richest brewing;<BR>
Honey-drink is brought and offered<BR>
To the blacksmith of Wainola,<BR>
Ilmarinen thus replying:<BR>
"I shall not in all my life-time<BR>
Taste the drink that thou hast brought me,<BR>
Till I see the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
Fairy Maiden of the Rainbow;<BR>
I will drink with her in gladness,<BR>
For whose hand I journey hither."<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Trouble does the one selected<BR>
Give to him that wooes and watches;<BR>
Not yet are her feet in sandals,<BR>
Thine affianced is not ready.<BR>
Only canst thou woo my daughter,<BR>
Only canst thou win the maiden,<BR>
When thou hast by aid of magic<BR>
Plowed the serpent-field of Hisi,<BR>
Plowed the field of hissing vipers,<BR>
Touching neither beam nor handles.<BR>
Once this field was plowed by Piru,<BR>
Lempo furrowed it with horses,<BR>
With a plowshare made of copper,<BR>
With a beam of flaming iron;<BR>
Never since has any hero<BR>
Brought this field to cultivation."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen of Wainola<BR>
Straightway hastens to the chamber<BR>
Of the Maiden of the Rainbow,<BR>
Speaks these words in hesitation:<BR>
"Thou of Night and Dawn the daughter,<BR>
Tell me, dost thou not remember<BR>
When for thee I forged the Sampo,<BR>
Hammered thee the lid in colors?<BR>
Thou didst swear by oath the strougest,<BR>
By the forge and by the anvil,<BR>
By the tongs and by the hammer,<BR>
In the ears of the Almighty,<BR>
And before omniscient Ukko,<BR>
Thou wouldst follow me hereafter,<BR>
Be my bride, my life-companion,<BR>
Be my honored wife forever.<BR>
Now thy mother is exacting,<BR>
Will not give to me her daughter,<BR>
Till by means of magic only,<BR>
I have plowed the field of serpents,<BR>
Plowed the hissing soil of Hisi."</P>
<P>The affianced Bride of Beauty<BR>
Gives this answer to the suitor:<BR>
"O, thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
The eternal wonder-forger,<BR>
Forge thyself a golden plowshare,<BR>
Forge the beam of shining silver,<BR>
And of copper forge the handles;<BR>
Then with ease, by aid of magic,<BR>
Thou canst plow the field of serpents,<BR>
Plow the hissing soil of Hisi."</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, welcome suitor,<BR>
Straightway builds a forge and smithy,<BR>
Places gold within the furnace,<BR>
In the forge he lays the silver,<BR>
Forges then a golden plowshare,<BR>
Forges, too, a beam of silver,<BR>
Forges handles out of copper,<BR>
Forges boots and gloves of iron,<BR>
Forges him a mail of metal,<BR>
For his limbs a safe protection,<BR>
Safe protection for his body.<BR>
Then a horse of fire selecting,<BR>
Harnesses the flaming stallion,<BR>
Goes to plow the field of serpents,<BR>
Plow the viper-lands of Hisi.<BR>
In the field were countless vipers,<BR>
Serpents there of every species,<BR>
Crawling, writhing, hissing, stinging,<BR>
Harmless all against the hero,<BR>
Thus he stills the snakes of Lempo:<BR>
"Vipers, ye by God created,<BR>
Neither best nor worst of creatures,<BR>
Ye whose wisdom comes from Ukko,<BR>
And whose venom comes from Hisi,<BR>
Ukko is your greater Master,<BR>
By His will your heads are lifted;<BR>
Get ye hence before my plowing,<BR>
Writ-he ye through the grass and stubble,<BR>
Crawl ye to the nearest thicket,<BR>
Keep your heads beneath the heather,<BR>
Hunt our holes to Mana's kingdom<BR>
If your poison-heads be lifted,<BR>
Then will mighty Ukko smite them<BR>
'With his iron-pointed arrows,<BR>
With the lightning of his anger."</P>
<P>Thus the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Safely plows the field of serpents,<BR>
Lifts the vipers in his plowing,<BR>
Buries them beneath the furrow,<BR>
Harmless all against his magic.<BR>
When the task had been completed,<BR>
Ilmarinen, quick returning,<BR>
Thus addressed Pohyola's hostess:<BR>
"I have plowed the field of Hisi,<BR>
Plowed the field of hissing serpents,<BR>
Stilled and banished all the vipers;<BR>
Give me, ancient dame, thy daughter,<BR>
Fairest maiden of the Northland.<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Shall not grant to thee my daughter,<BR>
Shall not give my lovely virgin,<BR>
Till Tuoni's bear is muzzled,<BR>
Till Manala's wolf is conquered,<BR>
In the forests of the Death-land,<BR>
In the boundaries of Mana.<BR>
Hundreds have been sent to hunt him,<BR>
So one yet has been successful,<BR>
All have perished in Manala."</P>
<P>Thereupon young Ilmarinen<BR>
To the maiden's chamber hastens,<BR>
Thus addresses his affianced:<BR>
"Still another test demanded,<BR>
I must go to Tuonela,<BR>
Bridle there the bear of Mana,<BR>
Bring him from the Death-land forests,<BR>
From Tuoni's grove and empire!<BR>
This advice the maiden gives him:<BR>
"O thou artist, Ilmarinen,<BR>
The eternal metal-worker,<BR>
Forge of steel a magic bridle,<BR>
On a rock beneath the water,<BR>
In the foaming triple currents;<BR>
Make the straps of steel and copper,<BR>
Bridle then the bear of Mana,<BR>
Lead him from Tuoni's forests."</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Forged of steel a magic bridle,<BR>
On a rock beneath the water,<BR>
In the foam of triple currents;<BR>
Made the straps of steel and copper,<BR>
Straightway went the bear to muzzle,<BR>
In the forests of the Death-land,<BR>
Spake these words in supplication:<BR>
"Terhenetar, ether-maiden,<BR>
Daughter of the fog and snow-flake,<BR>
Sift the fog and let it settle<BR>
O'er the bills and lowland thickets,<BR>
Where the wild-bear feeds and lingers,<BR>
That he may not see my coming,<BR>
May not hear my stealthy footsteps!"</P>
<P>Terhenetar hears his praying,<BR>
Makes the fog and snow-flake settle<BR>
On the coverts of the wild-beasts;<BR>
Thus the bear he safely bridles,<BR>
Fetters him in chains of magic,<BR>
In the forests of Tuoni,<BR>
In the blue groves of Manala.</P>
<P>When this task had been completed,<BR>
Ilmarinen, quick returning,<BR>
Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:<BR>
"Give me, worthy dame, thy daughter,<BR>
Give me now my bride affianced,<BR>
I have brought the bear of Mana<BR>
From Tuoni's fields and forests."<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola<BR>
To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"I will only give my daughter,<BR>
Give to thee the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
When the monster-pike thou catchest<BR>
In the river of Tuoni,<BR>
In Manala's fatal waters,<BR>
Using neither hooks, nor fish-nets,<BR>
Neither boat, nor fishing-tackle;<BR>
Hundreds have been sent to catch him,<BR>
No one yet has been successful,<BR>
All have perished in Manala."</P>
<P>Much disheartened, Ilmarinen<BR>
Hastened to the maiden's chamber,<BR>
Thus addressed the rainbow-maiden:<BR>
"Now a third test is demanded,<BR>
Much more difficult than ever;<BR>
I must catch the pike of Mana,<BR>
In the river of Tuoni,<BR>
And without my fishing-tackle,<BR>
Hard the third test of the hero!<BR>
This advice the maiden gives him:<BR>
"O thou hero, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Never, never be discouraged:<BR>
In thy furnace, forge an eagle,<BR>
From the fire of ancient magic;<BR>
He will catch the pike of Mana,<BR>
Catch the monster-fish in safety,<BR>
From the death-stream of Tuoni,<BR>
From Manala's fatal waters."</P>
<P>Then the suitor, Ilmarinen,<BR>
The eternal artist-forgeman,<BR>
In the furnace forged an eagle<BR>
From the fire of ancient wisdom;<BR>
For this giant bird of magic<BR>
Forged he talons out of iron,<BR>
And his beak of steel and copper;<BR>
Seats himself upon the eagle,<BR>
On his back between the wing-bones,<BR>
Thus addresses he his creature,<BR>
Gives the bird of fire, this order:<BR>
"Mighty eagle, bird of beauty,<BR>
Fly thou whither I direct thee,<BR>
To Tuoni's coal-black river,<BR>
To the blue deeps of the Death-stream,<BR>
Seize the mighty fish of Mana,<BR>
Catch for me this water-monster."</P>
<P>Swiftly flies the magic eagle,<BR>
Giant-bird of worth and wonder,<BR>
To the river of Tuoni,<BR>
There to catch the pike of Mana;<BR>
One wing brushes on the waters,<BR>
While the other sweeps the heavens;<BR>
In the ocean dips his talons,<BR>
Whets his beak on mountain-ledges.</P>
<P>Safely landing, Ilmarinen,<BR>
The immortal artist-forger,<BR>
Hunts the monster of the Death-stream,<BR>
While the eagle hunts and fishes<BR>
In the waters of Manala.<BR>
From the river rose a monster,<BR>
Grasped the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Tried to drag him to his sea-cave;<BR>
Quick the eagle pounced upon him,<BR>
With his metal-beak he seized him,<BR>
Wrenched his head, and rent his body,<BR>
Hurled him back upon the bottom<BR>
Of the deep and fatal river,<BR>
Freed his master, Ilmarinen.</P>
<P>Then arose the pike of Mana,<BR>
Came the water-dog in silence,<BR>
Of the pikes was not the largest,<BR>
Nor belonged he to the smallest;<BR>
Tongue the length of double hatchets,<BR>
Teeth as long as fen-rake handles,<BR>
Mouth as broad as triple streamlets,<BR>
Back as wide as seven sea-boats,<BR>
Tried to snap the magic blacksmith,<BR>
Tried to swallow Ilmarinen.<BR>
Swiftly swoops the mighty eagle,<BR>
Of the birds was not the largest,<BR>
Nor belonged he to the smallest;<BR>
Mouth as wide as seven streamlets,<BR>
Tongue as long as seven javelins,<BR>
Like five crooked scythes his talons;<BR>
Swoops upon the pike of Mana.<BR>
Quick the giant fish endangered,<BR>
Darts and flounders in the river,<BR>
Dragging down the mighty eagle,<BR>
Lashing up the very bottom<BR>
To the surface of the river;<BR>
When the mighty bird uprising<BR>
Leaves the wounded pike in water,<BR>
Soars aloft on worsted pinions<BR>
To his home in upper ether;<BR>
Soars awhile, and sails, and circles,<BR>
Circles o'er the reddened waters,<BR>
Swoops again on lightning-pinions,<BR>
Strikes with mighty force his talons<BR>
Into the shoulder of his victim;<BR>
Strikes the second of his talons<BR>
On the flinty mountain-ledges,<BR>
On the rocks with iron hardened;<BR>
From the cliffs rebound his talons,<BR>
Slip the flinty rocks o'erhanging,<BR>
And the monster-pike resisting<BR>
Dives again beneath the surface<BR>
To the bottom of the river,<BR>
From the talons of the eagle;<BR>
Deep, the wounds upon the body<BR>
Of the monster of Tuoni.<BR>
Still a third time soars the eagle,<BR>
Soars, and sails, and quickly circles,<BR>
Swoops again upon the monster,<BR>
Fire out-shooting from his pinoins,<BR>
Both his eyeballs flashing lightning;<BR>
With his beak of steel and copper<BR>
Grasps again the pike of Mana<BR>
Firmly planted are his talons<BR>
In the rocks and in his victim,<BR>
Drags the monster from the river,<BR>
Lifts the pike above the waters,<BR>
From Tuoni's coal-black river,<BR>
From the blue-back of Manala.</P>
<P>Thus the third time does the eagle<BR>
Bring success from former failures;<BR>
Thus at last the eagle catches<BR>
Mana's pike, the worst of fishes,<BR>
Swiftest swimmer of the waters,<BR>
From the river of Tuoni;<BR>
None could see Manala's river,<BR>
For the myriad of fish-scales;<BR>
Hardly could one see through ether,<BR>
For the feathers of the eagle,<BR>
Relicts of the mighty contest.</P>
<P>Then the bird of copper talons<BR>
Took the pike, with scales of silver,<BR>
To the pine-tree's topmost branches,<BR>
To the fir-tree plumed with needles,<BR>
Tore the monster-fish in pieces,<BR>
Ate the body of his victim,<BR>
Left the head for Ilmarinen.<BR>
Spake the blacksmith to the eagle:<BR>
"O thou bird of evil nature,<BR>
What thy thought and what thy motive?<BR>
Thou hast eaten what I needed,<BR>
Evidence of my successes;<BR>
Thoughtless eagle, witless instinct,<BR>
Thus to mar the spoils of conquest!"</P>
<P>But the bird of metal talons<BR>
Hastened onward, soaring upward,<BR>
Rising higher into ether,<BR>
Rising, flying, soaring, sailing,<BR>
To the borders of the long-clouds,<BR>
Made the vault of ether tremble,<BR>
Split apart the dome of heaven,<BR>
Broke the colored bow of Ukko,<BR>
Tore the Moon-horns from their sockets,<BR>
Disappeared beyond the Sun-land,<BR>
To the home of the triumphant.</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Took the pike-head to the hostess<BR>
Of the ever-dismal Northland,<BR>
Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:<BR>
"Let this head forever serve thee<BR>
As a guest-bench for thy dwelling,<BR>
Evidence of hero-triumphs;<BR>
I have caught the pike of Mana,<BR>
I have done as thou demandest,<BR>
Three my victories in Death-land,<BR>
Three the tests of magic heroes;<BR>
Wilt thou give me now thy daughter,<BR>
Give to me the Maid of Beauty?"<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Badly is the test accomplished,<BR>
Thou has torn the pike in pieces,<BR>
From his neck the head is severed,<BR>
Of his body thou hast eaten,<BR>
Brought to me this worthless relic!<BR>
These the words of Ilmarinen:<BR>
"When the victory is greatest,<BR>
Do we suffer greatest losses!<BR>
From the river of Tuoni,<BR>
From the kingdom of Manala,<BR>
I have brought to thee this trophy,<BR>
Thus the third task is completed.<BR>
Tell me is the maiden ready,<BR>
Wilt thou give the bride affianced?<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"I will give to thee my daughter,<BR>
Will prepare my snow-white virgin,<BR>
For the suitor, Ilmarinen;<BR>
Thou hast won the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
Bride is she of thine hereafter,<BR>
Fit companion of thy fireside,<BR>
Help and joy of all thy lifetime."</P>
<P>On the floor a child was sitting,<BR>
And the babe this tale related.<BR>
"There appeared within this dwelling,<BR>
Came a bird within the castle,<BR>
From the East came flying hither,<BR>
From the East, a monstrous eagle,<BR>
One wing touched the vault of heaven,<BR>
While the other swept the ocean;<BR>
With his tail upon the waters,<BR>
Reached his beak beyond the cloudlets,<BR>
Looked about, and eager watching,<BR>
Flew around, and sailing, soaring,<BR>
Flew away to hero-castle,<BR>
Knocked three times with beak of copper<BR>
On the castle-roof of iron;<BR>
But the eagle could not enter.</P>
<P>"Then the eagle, looking round him,<BR>
Flew again, and sailed, and circled,<BR>
Flew then to the mothers' castle,<BR>
Loudly rapped with heavy knocking<BR>
On the mothers' roof of copper;<BR>
But the eagle could not enter.</P>
<P>"Then the eagle, looking round him,<BR>
Flew a third time, sailing, soaring,<BR>
Flew then to the virgins' castle,<BR>
Knocked again with beak of copper,<BR>
On the virgins' roof of linen,<BR>
Easy for him there to enter;<BR>
Flew upon the castle-chimney,<BR>
Quick descending to the chamber,<BR>
Pulled the clapboards from the studding,<BR>
Tore the linen from the rafters,<BR>
Perched upon the chamber-window,<BR>
Near the walls of many colors,<BR>
On the cross-bars gaily-feathered,<BR>
Looked upon the curly-beaded,<BR>
Looked upon their golden ringlets,<BR>
Looked upon the snow-white virgins,<BR>
On the purest of the maidens,<BR>
On the fairest of the daughters,<BR>
On the maid with pearly necklace,<BR>
On the maiden wreathed in flowers;<BR>
Perched awhile, and looked, admiring,<BR>
Swooped upon the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
On the purest of the virgins,<BR>
On the whitest, on the fairest,<BR>
On the stateliest and grandest,<BR>
Swooped upon the rainbow-daughter<BR>
Of the dismal Sariola;<BR>
Grasped her in his mighty talons,<BR>
Bore away the Maid of Beauty,<BR>
Maid of fairest form and feature,<BR>
Maid adorned with pearly necklace,<BR>
Decked in feathers iridescent,<BR>
Fragrant flowers upon her bosom,<BR>
Scarlet band around her forehead,<BR>
Golden rings upon her fingers,<BR>
Fairest maiden of the Northland."</P>
<P>Spake the hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
When the babe his tale had ended:<BR>
"Tell me bow, my child beloved,<BR>
Thou hast learned about the maiden,<BR>
Hast obtained the information,<BR>
How her flaxen ringlets nestled,<BR>
How the maiden's silver glistened,<BR>
How the virgin's gold was lauded.<BR>
Shone the silver Sun upon thee,<BR>
Did the moonbeams bring this knowledge?"<BR>
From the floor the child made answer:<BR>
"Thus I gained the information,<BR>
Moles of good-luck led me hither,<BR>
To the home, of the distinguished,<BR>
To the guest-room of the maiden,<BR>
Good-name bore her worthy father,<BR>
He that sailed the magic vessel;<BR>
Better-name enjoyed the mother,<BR>
She that baked the bread of barley,<BR>
She that kneaded wheaten biscuits,<BR>
Fed her many guests in Northland.</P>
<P>"Thus the information reached me,<BR>
Thus the distant stranger heard it,<BR>
Heard the virgin had arisen:<BR>
Once I walked within the court-yard,<BR>
Stepping near the virgin's chamber,<BR>
At an early hour of morning,<BR>
Ere the Sun had broken slumber<BR>
Whirling rose the soot in cloudlets,<BR>
Blackened wreaths of smoke came rising<BR>
From the chamber of the maiden,<BR>
From thy daughter's lofty chimney;<BR>
There the maid was busy grinding,<BR>
Moved the handles of the millstone<BR>
Making voices like the cuckoo,<BR>
Like the ducks the side-holes sounded,<BR>
And the sifter like the goldfinch,<BR>
Like the sea-pearls sang the grindstones.</P>
<P>"Then a second time I wandered<BR>
To the border of the meadow<BR>
In the forest was the maiden<BR>
Rocking on a fragrant hillock,<BR>
Dyeing red in iron vessels,<BR>
And in copper kettles, yellow.</P>
<P>"Then a third time did I wander<BR>
To the lovely maiden's window;<BR>
There I saw thy daughter weaving,<BR>
Heard the flying of her shuttle,<BR>
Heard the beating of her loom-lathe,<BR>
Heard the rattling of her treddles,<BR>
Heard the whirring of her yarn-reel."<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Now alas! beloved daughter,<BR>
I have often taught this lesson:<BR>
'Do not sing among the pine-trees,<BR>
Do not call adown the valleys,<BR>
Do not hang thy head in walking,<BR>
Do not bare thine arms, nor shoulders,<BR>
Keep the secrets of thy bosom,<BR>
Hide thy beauty and thy power.'</P>
<P>"This I told thee in the autumn,<BR>
Taught thee in the summer season,<BR>
Sang thee in the budding spring-time,<BR>
Sang thee when the snows were falling:<BR>
'Let us build a place for hiding,<BR>
Let us build the smallest windows,<BR>
Where may weave my fairest daughter,<BR>
Where my maid may ply her shuttle,<BR>
Where my joy may work unnoticed<BR>
By the heroes of the Northland,<BR>
By the suitors of Wainola.'"</P>
<P>From the floor the child made answer,<BR>
Fourteen days the young child numbered;<BR>
"Easy 'tis to hide a war-horse<BR>
In the Northland fields and stables;<BR>
Hard indeed to hide a maiden,<BR>
Having lovely form and features!<BR>
Build of stone a distant castle<BR>
In the middle of the ocean,<BR>
Keep within thy lovely maiden,<BR>
Train thou there thy winsome daughter,<BR>
Not long hidden canst thou keep her.<BR>
Maidens will not grow and flourish,<BR>
Kept apart from men and heroes,<BR>
Will not live without their suitors,<BR>
Will not thrive without their wooers;<BR>
Thou canst never hide a maiden,<BR>
Neither on the land nor water."</P>
<P>Now the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Head down-bent and heavy-hearted,<BR>
Wanders to his native country,<BR>
To Wainola's peaceful meadows,<BR>
To the plains of Kalevala,<BR>
Chanting as he journeys homeward:<BR>
"I have passed the age for wooing,<BR>
Woe is me, rejected suitor,<BR>
Woe is me, a witless minstrel,<BR>
That I did not woo and marry,<BR>
When my face was young and winsome,<BR>
When my hand was warm and welcome!<BR>
Youth dethrones my age and station,<BR>
Wealth is nothing, wisdom worthless,<BR>
When a hero goes a-wooing<BR>
With a poor but younger brother.<BR>
Fatal error that a hero<BR>
Does not wed in early manhood,<BR>
In his youth does not be master<BR>
Of a worthy wife and household."</P>
<P>Thus the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Sends the edict to his people:<BR>
"Old men must not go a-wooing,<BR>
Must not swim the sea of anger,<BR>
Must not row upon a wager,<BR>
Must not run a race for glory,<BR>
With the younger sons of Northland."</P>
