<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WAINAMOINEN'S HARP-SONGS.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<BR>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<BR>
Laves his hands to snowy whiteness,<BR>
Sits upon the rock of joyance,<BR>
On the stone of song be settles,<BR>
On the mount of silver clearness,<BR>
On the summit, golden colored;<BR>
Takes the harp by him created,<BR>
In his hands the harp of fish-bone,<BR>
With his knee the arch supporting,<BR>
Takes the harp-strings in his fingers,<BR>
Speaks these words to those assembled:<BR>
"Hither come, ye Northland people,<BR>
Come and listen to my playing,<BR>
To the harp's entrancing measures,<BR>
To my songs of joy and gladness."</P>
<P>Then the singer of Wainola<BR>
Took the harp of his creation,<BR>
Quick adjusting, sweetly tuning,<BR>
Deftly plied his skillful fingers<BR>
To the strings that he had fashioned.<BR>
Now was gladness rolled on gladness,<BR>
And the harmony of pleasure<BR>
Echoed from the hills and mountains:<BR>
Added singing to his playing,<BR>
Out of joy did joy come welling,<BR>
Now resounded marvelous music,<BR>
All of Northland stopped and listened.<BR>
Every creature in the forest,<BR>
All the beasts that haunt the woodlands,<BR>
On their nimble feet came bounding,<BR>
Came to listen to his playing,<BR>
Came to hear his songs of joyance.<BR>
Leaped the squirrels from the branches,<BR>
Merrily from birch to aspen;<BR>
Climbed the ermines on the fences,<BR>
O'er the plains the elk-deer bounded,<BR>
And the lynxes purred with pleasure;<BR>
Wolves awoke in far-off swamp-lands,<BR>
Bounded o'er the marsh and heather,<BR>
And the bear his den deserted,<BR>
Left his lair within the pine-wood,<BR>
Settled by a fence to listen,<BR>
Leaned against the listening gate-posts,<BR>
But the gate-posts yield beneath him;<BR>
Now he climbs the fir-tree branches<BR>
That he may enjoy and wonder,<BR>
Climbs and listens to the music<BR>
Of the harp of Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>Tapiola's wisest senior,<BR>
Metsola's most noble landlord,<BR>
And of Tapio, the people,<BR>
Young and aged, men and maidens,<BR>
Flew like red-deer up the mountains<BR>
There to listen to the playing,<BR>
To the harp, of Wainamoinen.<BR>
Tapiola's wisest mistress,<BR>
Hostess of the glen and forest,<BR>
Robed herself in blue and scarlet,<BR>
Bound her limbs with silken ribbons,<BR>
Sat upon the woodland summit,<BR>
On the branches of a birch-tree,<BR>
There to listen to the playing,<BR>
To the high-born hero's harping,<BR>
To the songs of Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>All the birds that fly in mid-air<BR>
Fell like snow-flakes from the heavens,<BR>
Flew to hear the minstrel's playing,<BR>
Hear the harp of Wainamoinen.<BR>
Eagles in their lofty eyrie<BR>
Heard the songs of the enchanter;<BR>
Swift they left their unfledged young ones,<BR>
Flew and perched around the minstrel.<BR>
From the heights the hawks descended,<BR>
From the, clouds down swooped the falcon,<BR>
Ducks arose from inland waters,<BR>
Swans came gliding from the marshes;<BR>
Tiny finches, green and golden,<BR>
Flew in flocks that darkened sunlight,<BR>
Came in myriads to listen '<BR>
Perched upon the head and shoulders<BR>
Of the charming Wainamoinen,<BR>
Sweetly singing to the playing<BR>
Of the ancient bard and minstrel.<BR>
And the daughters of the welkin,<BR>
Nature's well-beloved daughters,<BR>
Listened all in rapt attention;<BR>
Some were seated on the rainbow,<BR>
Some upon the crimson cloudlets,<BR>
Some upon the dome of heaven.</P>
<P>In their hands the Moon's fair daughters<BR>
Held their weaving-combs of silver;<BR>
In their hands the Sun's sweet maidens<BR>
Grasped the handles of their distaffs,<BR>
Weaving with their golden shuttles,<BR>
Spinning from their silver spindles,<BR>
On the red rims of the cloudlets,<BR>
On the bow of many colors.<BR>
As they hear the minstrel playing,<BR>
Hear the harp of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Quick they drop their combs of silver,<BR>
Drop the spindles from their fingers,<BR>
And the golden threads are broken,<BR>
Broken are the threads of silver.</P>
<P>All the fish in Suomi-waters<BR>
Heard the songs of the magician,<BR>
Came on flying fins to listen<BR>
To the harp of Wainamoinen.<BR>
Came the trout with graceful motions,<BR>
Water-dogs with awkward movements,<BR>
From the water-cliffs the salmon,<BR>
From the sea-caves came the whiting,<BR>
From the deeper caves the bill-fish;<BR>
Came the pike from beds of sea-fern,<BR>
Little fish with eyes of scarlet,<BR>
Leaning on the reeds and rushes,<BR>
With their heads above the surface;<BR>
Came to bear the harp of joyance,<BR>
Hear the songs of the enchanter.</P>
<P>Ahto, king of all the waters,<BR>
Ancient king with beard of sea-grass,<BR>
Raised his head above the billows,<BR>
In a boat of water-lilies,<BR>
Glided to the coast in silence,<BR>
Listened to the wondrous singing,<BR>
To the harp of Wainamoinen.<BR>
These the words the sea-king uttered:<BR>
"Never have I heard such playing,<BR>
Never heard such strains of music,<BR>
Never since the sea was fashioned,<BR>
As the songs of this enchanter,<BR>
This sweet singer, Wainamoinen."</P>
<P>Satko's daughters from the blue-deep,<BR>
Sisters of the wave-washed ledges,<BR>
On the colored strands were sitting,<BR>
Smoothing out their sea-green tresses<BR>
With the combs of molten silver,<BR>
With their silver-handled brushes,<BR>
Brushes forged with golden bristles.<BR>
When they hear the magic playing,<BR>
Hear the harp of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Fall their brushes on the billows,<BR>
Fall their combs with silver handles<BR>
To the bottom of the waters,<BR>
Unadorned their heads remaining,<BR>
And uncombed their sea-green tresses.</P>
<P>Came the hostess of the waters,<BR>
Ancient hostess robed in flowers,<BR>
Rising from her deep sea-castle,<BR>
Swimming to the shore in wonder,<BR>
Listened to the minstrel's playing,<BR>
To the harp of Wainamoinen.<BR>
As the magic tones re-echoed,<BR>
As the singer's song out-circled,<BR>
Sank the hostess into slumber,<BR>
On the rocks of many colors,<BR>
On her watery couch of joyance,<BR>
Deep the sleep that settled o'er her.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Played one day and then a second,<BR>
Played the third from morn till even.<BR>
There was neither man nor hero,<BR>
Neither ancient dame, nor maiden,<BR>
Not in Metsola a daughter,<BR>
Whom he did not touch to weeping;<BR>
Wept the young, and wept the aged,<BR>
Wept the mothers, wept the daughters<BR>
Wept the warriors and heroes<BR>
At the music of his playing,<BR>
At the songs of the magician.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen's tears came flowing,<BR>
Welling from the master's eyelids,<BR>
Pearly tear-drops coursing downward,<BR>
Larger than the whortle-berries,<BR>
Finer than the pearls of ocean,<BR>
Smoother than the eggs of moor-hens,<BR>
Brighter than the eyes of swallows.<BR>
From his eves the tear-drops started,<BR>
Flowed adown his furrowed visage,<BR>
Falling from his beard in streamlets,<BR>
Trickled on his heaving bosom,<BR>
Streaming o'er his golden girdle,<BR>
Coursing to his garment's border,<BR>
Then beneath his shoes of ermine,<BR>
Flowing on, and flowing ever,<BR>
Part to earth for her possession,<BR>
Part to water for her portion.<BR>
As the tear-drops fall and mingle,<BR>
Form they streamlets from the eyelids<BR>
Of the minstrel, Wainamoinen,<BR>
To the blue-mere's sandy margin,<BR>
To the deeps of crystal waters,<BR>
Lost among the reeds and rushes.<BR>
Spake at last the ancient minstrel:<BR>
"Is there one in all this concourse,<BR>
One in all this vast assembly<BR>
That can gather up my tear-drops<BR>
From the deep, pellucid waters?"</P>
<P>Thus the younger heroes answered,<BR>
Answered thus the bearded seniors:<BR>
"There is none in all this concourse,<BR>
None in all this vast assembly,<BR>
That can gather up thy tear-drops<BR>
From the deep, pellucid waters."<BR>
Spake again wise Wainamoinen:<BR>
"He that gathers up my tear-drops<BR>
From the deeps of crystal waters<BR>
Shall receive a beauteous plumage."</P>
<P>Came a raven, flying, croaking,<BR>
And the minstrel thus addressed him:<BR>
"Bring, O raven, bring my tear-drops<BR>
From the crystal lake's abysses;<BR>
I will give thee beauteous plumage,<BR>
Recompense for golden service."<BR>
But the raven failed his master.</P>
<P>Came a duck upon the waters,<BR>
And the hero thus addressed him:<BR>
"Bring O water-bird, my tear-drops;<BR>
Often thou dost dive the deep-sea,<BR>
Sink thy bill upon the bottom<BR>
Of the waters thou dost travel;<BR>
Dive again my tears to gather,<BR>
I will give thee beauteous plumage,<BR>
Recompense for golden service."</P>
<P>Thereupon the duck departed,<BR>
Hither, thither, swam, and circled,<BR>
Dived beneath the foam and billow,<BR>
Gathered Wainamoinen's tear-drops<BR>
From the blue-sea's pebbly bottom,<BR>
From the deep, pellucid waters;<BR>
Brought them to the great magician,<BR>
Beautifully formed and colored,<BR>
Glistening in the silver sunshine,<BR>
Glimmering in the golden moonlight,<BR>
Many-colored as the rainbow,<BR>
Fitting ornaments for heroes,<BR>
Jewels for the maids of beauty.<BR>
This the origin of sea-pearls,<BR>
And the blue-duck's beauteous plumage.</P>
