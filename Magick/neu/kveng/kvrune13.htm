<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">LEMMINIKAINEN'S SECOND WOOING.</H1>
<P>SPAKE the ancient Lemminkainen<BR>
To the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Give to me thy lovely daughter,<BR>
Bring me now thy winsome maiden,<BR>
Bring the best of Lapland virgins,<BR>
Fairest virgin of the Northland."</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Answered thus the wild magician:<BR>
"I shall never give my daughter,<BR>
Never give my fairest maiden,<BR>
Not the best one, nor the worst one,<BR>
Not the largest, nor the smallest;<BR>
Thou hast now one wife-companion,<BR>
Thou has taken hence one hostess,<BR>
Carried off the fair Kyllikki."</P>
<P>This is Lemminkainen's answer:<BR>
To my home I took Kyllikki,<BR>
To my cottage on the island,<BR>
To my entry-gates and kindred;<BR>
Now I wish a better hostess,<BR>
Straightway bring thy fairest daughter,<BR>
Worthiest of all thy virgins,<BR>
Fairest maid with sable tresses."<BR>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<BR>
"Never will I give my daughter<BR>
To a hero false and worthless,<BR>
To a minstrel vain and evil;<BR>
Therefore, pray thou for my maiden,<BR>
Therefore, woo the sweet-faced flower,<BR>
When thou bringest me the wild-moose<BR>
From the Hisi fields and forests."</P>
<P>Then the artful Lemminkainen<BR>
Deftly whittled out his javelins,<BR>
Quickly made his leathern bow-string,<BR>
And prepared his bow and arrows,<BR>
And soliloquized as follows:<BR>
"Now my javelins are made ready,<BR>
All my arrows too are ready,<BR>
And my oaken cross-bow bended,<BR>
But my snow-shoes are not builded,<BR>
Who will make me worthy snow-shoes?"</P>
<P>Lemminkainen, grave and thoughtful,<BR>
Long reflected, well considered,<BR>
Where the snow-shoes could be fashioned,<BR>
Who the artist that could make them;<BR>
Hastened to the Kauppi-smithy,<BR>
To the smithy of Lylikki,<BR>
Thus addressed the snow-shoe artist:<BR>
"O thou skilful Woyalander,<BR>
Kauppi, ablest smith of Lapland,<BR>
Make me quick two worthy snow-shoes,<BR>
Smooth them well and make them hardy,<BR>
That in Tapio the wild-moose,<BR>
Roaming through the Hisi-forests,<BR>
I may catch and bring to Louhi,<BR>
As a dowry for her daughter."</P>
<P>Then Lylikki thus made answer,<BR>
Kauppi gave this prompt decision:<BR>
"Lemminkainen, reckless minstrel,<BR>
Thou wilt hunt in vain the wild-moose,<BR>
Thou wilt catch but pain and torture,<BR>
In the Hisi fens and forests."</P>
<P>Little heeding, Lemminkainen<BR>
Spake these measures to Lylikki<BR>
"Make for me the worthy snow-shoes,<BR>
Quickly work and make them ready;<BR>
Go I will and catch the blue-moose<BR>
Where in Tapio it browses,<BR>
In the Hisi woods and snow-fields."</P>
<P>Then Lylikki, snow-shoe-maker,<BR>
Ancient Kauppi, master artist,<BR>
Whittled in the fall his show-shoes,<BR>
Smoothed them in the winter evenings,<BR>
One day working on the runners,<BR>
All the next day making stick-rings,<BR>
Till at last the shoes were finished,<BR>
And the workmanship was perfect.<BR>
Then he fastened well the shoe-straps,<BR>
Smooth as adder's skin the woodwork,<BR>
Soft as fox-fur were the stick-rings;<BR>
Oiled he well his wondrous snow-shoes<BR>
With the tallow of the reindeer;<BR>
When he thus soliloquizes,<BR>
These the accents of Lylikki:<BR>
"Is there any youth in Lapland,<BR>
Any in this generation,<BR>
That can travel in these snow-shoes,<BR>
That can move the lower sections?"</P>
<P>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<BR>
Full of hope, and life, and vigor:<BR>
Surely there is one in Lapland.<BR>
In this rising generation,<BR>
That can travel in these snow-shoes,<BR>
That the right and left can manage."</P>
<P>To his back he tied the quiver,<BR>
Placed the bow upon his shoulder,<BR>
With both hands he grasped his snow-cane,<BR>
Speaking meanwhile words as follow:<BR>
"There is nothing in the woodlands,<BR>
Nothing in the world of Ukko,<BR>
Nothing underneath the heavens,<BR>
In the uplands, in the lowlands,<BR>
Nothing in the snow-fields running,<BR>
Not a fleet deer of the forest,<BR>
That could not be overtaken<BR>
With the snow-shoes of Lylikki,<BR>
With the strides of Lemminkainen."</P>
<P>Wicked Hisi heard these measures,<BR>
Juntas listened to their echoes;<BR>
Straightway Hisi called the wild-moose,<BR>
Juutas fashioned soon a reindeer,<BR>
And the head was made of punk-wood,<BR>
Horns of naked willow branches,<BR>
Feet were furnished by the rushes,<BR>
And the legs, by reeds aquatic,<BR>
Veins were made of withered grasses,<BR>
Eyes, from daisies of the meadows,<BR>
Ears were formed of water-flowers,<BR>
And the skin of tawny fir-bark,<BR>
Out of sappy wood, the muscles,<BR>
Fair and fleet, the magic reindeer.</P>
<P>Juutas thus instructs the wild-moose,<BR>
These the words of wicked Hisi:<BR>
Flee away, thou moose of Juutas,<BR>
Flee away, thou Hisi-reindeer,<BR>
Like the winds, thou rapid courser,<BR>
To the snow-homes of the ranger,<BR>
To the ridges of the mountains,<BR>
To the snow-capped hills of Lapland,<BR>
That thy hunter may be worn out,<BR>
Thy pursuer be tormented,<BR>
Lemminkainen be exhausted."</P>
<P>Thereupon the Hisi-reindeer,<BR>
Juutas-moose with branching antlers,<BR>
Fleetly ran through fen and forest,<BR>
Over Lapland's hills and valleys,<BR>
Through the open fields and court-yards,<BR>
Through the penthouse doors and gate-ways,<BR>
Turning over tubs of water,<BR>
Threw the kettles from the fire-pole,<BR>
And upset the dishes cooking.<BR>
Then arose a fearful uproar,<BR>
In the court-yards of Pohyola,<BR>
Lapland-dogs began their barking,<BR>
Lapland-children cried in terror,<BR>
Lapland-women roared with laughter,<BR>
And the Lapland-heroes shouted.</P>
<P>Fleetly followed Lemminkainen,<BR>
Followed fast, and followed faster,<BR>
Hastened on behind the wild-moose,<BR>
Over swamps and through the woodlands,<BR>
Over snow-fields vast and pathless,<BR>
Over high uprising mountains,<BR>
Fire out-shooting from his runners,<BR>
Smoke arising from his snow-cane:<BR>
Could not hear the wild-moose bounding,<BR>
Could not sight the flying fleet-foot;<BR>
Glided on through field and forest,<BR>
Glided over lakes and rivers,<BR>
Over lands beyond the smooth-sea,<BR>
Through the desert plains of Hisi,<BR>
Glided o'er the plains of Kalma,<BR>
Through the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
To the end of Kalma's empire,<BR>
Where the jaws of Death stand open,<BR>
Where the head of Kalma lowers,<BR>
Ready to devour the stranger,<BR>
To devour wild Lemminkainen;<BR>
But Tuoni cannot reach him,<BR>
Kalma cannot overtake him.</P>
<P>Distant woods are yet untraveled,<BR>
Far away a woodland corner<BR>
Stands unsearched by Kaukomieli,<BR>
In the North's extensive, borders,<BR>
In the realm of dreary Lapland.<BR>
Now the hero, on his snow-shoes,<BR>
Hastens to the distant woodlands,<BR>
There to hunt the moose of Piru.<BR>
As he nears the woodland corner,<BR>
There he bears a frightful uproar,<BR>
From the Northland's distant borders,<BR>
From the dreary fields of Lapland,<BR>
Hears the dogs as they are barking,<BR>
Hears the children loudly screaming,<BR>
Hears the laughter or the women,<BR>
Hears the shouting of the heroes.<BR>
Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Hastens forward on his snow-shoes,<BR>
To the place where dogs are barking,<BR>
To the distant woods of Lapland.</P>
<P>When the reckless Kaukomieli<BR>
Had approached this Hisi corner,<BR>
Straightway he began to question:<BR>
"Why this laughter or the women,<BR>
Why the screaming of the children,<BR>
Why the shouting of the heroes,<BR>
Why this barking of the watch-dogs?<BR>
This reply was promptly given:<BR>
"This the reason for this uproar,<BR>
Women laughing, children screaming,<BR>
Heroes shouting, watch-dogs barking<BR>
Hisi's moose came running hither,<BR>
Hither came the Piru-Reindeer,<BR>
Hither came with hoofs of silver,<BR>
Through the open fields and court-yards,<BR>
Through the penthouse doors and gate-ways,<BR>
Turning over tubs or water,<BR>
Threw the kettles from the fire-pole,<BR>
And upset the dishes cooking."</P>
<P>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Straightway summoned all his courage,<BR>
Pushed ahead his mighty snow-shoes,<BR>
Swift as adders in the stubble,<BR>
Levelled bushes in the marshes,<BR>
Like the swift and fiery serpents,<BR>
Spake these words of magic import,<BR>
Keeping balance with his snow-staff:<BR>
Come thou might of Lapland heroes,<BR>
Bring to me the moose of Juutas;<BR>
Come thou strength of Lapland-women,<BR>
And prepare the boiling caldron;<BR>
Come, thou might of Lapland children,<BR>
Bring together fire and fuel;<BR>
Come, thou strength of Lapland-kettles,<BR>
Help to boil the Hisi wild-moose."</P>
<P>Then with mighty force and courage,<BR>
Lemminkainen hastened onward,<BR>
Striking backward, shooting forward;<BR>
With a long sweep of his snow-shoe,<BR>
Disappeared from view the hero;<BR>
With the second, shooting further,<BR>
Was the hunter out of hearing,<BR>
With the third the hero glided<BR>
On the shoulders of the wild-moose;<BR>
Took a pole of stoutest oak-wood,<BR>
Took some bark-strings from the willow,<BR>
Wherewithal to bind the moose-deer,<BR>
Bind him to his oaken hurdle.<BR>
To the moose he spake as follows:<BR>
"Here remain, thou moose of Juutas<BR>
Skip about, my bounding courser,<BR>
In my hurdle jump and frolic,<BR>
Captive from the fields of Piru,<BR>
From the Hisi glens and mountains."</P>
<P>Then he stroked the captured wild-moose,<BR>
Patted him upon his forehead,<BR>
Spake again in measured accents:<BR>
"I would like awhile to linger,<BR>
I would love to rest a moment<BR>
In the cottage of my maiden,<BR>
With my virgin, young and lovely."</P>
<P>Then the Hisi-moose grew angry,<BR>
Stamped his feet and shook his antlers,<BR>
Spake these words to Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Surely Lempo soon will got thee,<BR>
Shouldst thou sit beside the maiden,<BR>
Shouldst thou linger by the virgin."</P>
<P>Now the wild-moose stamps and rushes,<BR>
Tears in two the bands of willow,<BR>
Breaks the oak-wood pole in pieces,<BR>
And upturns the hunter's hurdle,<BR>
Quickly leaping from his captor,<BR>
Bounds away with strength of freedom,<BR>
Over hills and over lowlands,<BR>
Over swamps and over snow-fields,<BR>
Over mountains clothed in heather,<BR>
That the eye may not behold him,<BR>
Nor the hero's ear detect him.</P>
<P>Thereupon the mighty hunter<BR>
Angry grows, and much disheartened,<BR>
Starts again the moose to capture,<BR>
Gliding off behind the courser.<BR>
With his might he plunges forward;<BR>
At the instep breaks his snow-shoe,<BR>
Breaks the runners into fragments,<BR>
On the mountings breaks his javelins,<BR>
In the centre breaks his snow-staff,<BR>
And the moose bounds on before him,<BR>
Through the Hisi-woods and snow-fields,<BR>
Out of reach of Lemminkainen.</P>
<P>Then the reckless Kaukomieli<BR>
Looked with bended head, ill-humored,<BR>
One by one upon the fragments,<BR>
Speaking words of ancient wisdom:<BR>
"Northland hunters, never, never,<BR>
Go defiant to thy forests,<BR>
In the Hisi vales and mountains,<BR>
There to hunt the moose of Juutas,<BR>
Like this senseless, reckless hero;<BR>
I have wrecked my magic snow-shoes,<BR>
Ruined too my useful snow-staff,<BR>
And my javelins I have broken,<BR>
While the wild-moose runs in safety<BR>
Through the Hisi fields and forests."</P>
