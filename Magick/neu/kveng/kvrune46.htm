<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">OTSO THE HONEY-EATER.</H1>
<P>CAME the tidings to Pohyola,<BR>
To the village of the Northland,<BR>
That Wainola had recovered<BR>
From her troubles and misfortunes,<BR>
From her sicknesses and sorrows.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Toothless dame of Sariola,<BR>
Envy-laden, spake these measures:<BR>
"Know I other means of trouble,<BR>
I have many more resources;<BR>
I will drive the bear before me,<BR>
From the heather and the mountain,<BR>
Drive him from the fen and forest,<BR>
Drive great Otso from the glen-wood<BR>
On the cattle of Wainola,<BR>
On the flocks of Kalevala."</P>
<P>Thereupon the Northland hostess<BR>
Drove the hungry bear of Pohya<BR>
From his cavern to the meadows,<BR>
To Wainola's plains and pastures.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
To his brother spake as follows:<BR>
"O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Forge a spear from magic metals,<BR>
Forge a lancet triple-pointed,<BR>
Forge the handle out of copper,<BR>
That I may destroy great Otso,<BR>
Slay the mighty bear of Northland,<BR>
That he may not eat my horses,<BR>
Nor destroy my herds of cattle,<BR>
Nor the flocks upon my pastures."</P>
<P>Thereupon the skillful blacksmith<BR>
Forged a spear from magic metals,<BR>
Forged a lancet triple-pointed,<BR>
Not the longest, nor the shortest,<BR>
Forged the spear in wondrous beauty.<BR>
On one side a bear was sitting,<BR>
Sat a wolf upon the other,<BR>
On the blade an elk lay sleeping,<BR>
On the shaft a colt was running,<BR>
Near the hilt a roebuck bounding.</P>
<P>Snows had fallen from the heavens,<BR>
Made the flocks as white as ermine<BR>
Or the hare, in days of winter,<BR>
And the minstrel sang these measures:<BR>
"My desire impels me onward<BR>
To the Metsola-dominions,<BR>
To the homes of forest-maidens,<BR>
To the courts of the white virgins;<BR>
I will hasten to the forest,<BR>
Labor with the woodland-forces.</P>
<P>"Ruler of the Tapio-forests,<BR>
Make of me a conquering hero,<BR>
Help me clear these boundless woodlands.<BR>
O Mielikki, forest-hostess,<BR>
Tapio's wife, thou fair Tellervo,<BR>
Call thy dogs and well enchain them,<BR>
Set in readiness thy hunters,<BR>
Let them wait within their kennels.</P>
<P>"Otso, thou O Forest-apple,<BR>
Bear of honey-paws and fur-robes,<BR>
Learn that Wainamoinen follows,<BR>
That the singer comes to meet thee;<BR>
Hide thy claws within thy mittens,<BR>
Let thy teeth remain in darkness,<BR>
That they may not harm the minstrel,<BR>
May be powerless in battle.<BR>
Mighty Otso, much beloved,<BR>
Honey-eater of the mountains,<BR>
Settle on the rocks in slumber,<BR>
On the turf and in thy caverns;<BR>
Let the aspen wave above thee,<BR>
Let the merry birch-tree rustle<BR>
O'er thy head for thy protection.<BR>
Rest in peace, thou much-loved Otso,<BR>
Turn about within thy thickets,<BR>
Like the partridge at her brooding,<BR>
In the spring-time like the wild-goose."</P>
<P>When the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Heard his dog bark in the forest,<BR>
Heard his hunter's call and echo,<BR>
He addressed the words that follow:<BR>
"Thought it was the cuckoo calling,<BR>
Thought the pretty bird was singing;<BR>
It was not the sacred cuckoo,<BR>
Not the liquid notes of songsters,<BR>
'Twas my dog that called and murmured,<BR>
'Twas the echo of my hunter<BR>
At the cavern-doors of Otso,<BR>
On the border of the woodlands."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
Finds the mighty bear in waiting,<BR>
Lifts in joy the golden covers,<BR>
Well inspects his shining fur-robes;<BR>
Lifts his honey-paws in wonder,<BR>
Then addresses his Creator:<BR>
"Be thou praised, O mighty Ukko,<BR>
As thou givest me great Otso,<BR>
Givest me the Forest-apple,<BR>
Thanks be paid to thee unending."<BR>
To the bear he spake these measures:<BR>
"Otso, thou my well beloved,<BR>
Honey-eater of the woodlands,<BR>
Let not anger swell thy bosom;<BR>
I have not the force to slay thee,<BR>
Willingly thy life thou givest<BR>
As a sacrifice to Northland.<BR>
Thou hast from the tree descended,<BR>
Glided from the aspen branches,<BR>
Slippery the trunks in autumn,<BR>
In the fog-days, smooth the branches.<BR>
Golden friend of fen and forest,<BR>
In thy fur-robes rich and beauteous,<BR>
Pride of woodlands, famous Light-foot,<BR>
Leave thy cold and cheerless dwelling,<BR>
Leave thy home within the alders,<BR>
Leave thy couch among the willows,<BR>
Hasten in thy purple stockings,<BR>
Hasten from thy walks restricted,<BR>
Come among the haunts of heroes,<BR>
Join thy friends in Kalevala.<BR>
We shall never treat thee evil,<BR>
Thou shalt dwell in peace and plenty,<BR>
Thou shalt feed on milk and honey,<BR>
Honey is the food of strangers.<BR>
Haste away from this thy covert,<BR>
From the couch of the unworthy,<BR>
To a couch beneath the rafters<BR>
Of Wainola's ancient dwellings.<BR>
Haste thee onward o'er the snow-plain,<BR>
As a leaflet in the autumn;<BR>
Skip beneath these birchen branches,<BR>
As a squirrel in the summer,<BR>
As a cuckoo in the spring-time."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<BR>
O'er the snow-fields hastened homeward,<BR>
Singing o'er the hills and mountains,<BR>
With his guest, the ancient Otso,<BR>
With his friend, the, famous Light-foot,<BR>
With the Honey-paw of Northland.</P>
<P>Far away was heard the singing,<BR>
Heard the playing of the hunter,<BR>
Heard the songs of Wainamoinen;<BR>
All the people heard and wondered,<BR>
Men and maidens, young and aged,<BR>
From their cabins spake as follows:<BR>
"Hear the echoes from the woodlands,<BR>
Hear the bugle from the forest,<BR>
Hear the flute-notes of the songsters,<BR>
Hear the pipes of forest-maidens!"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,<BR>
Soon appears within the court-yard.<BR>
Rush the people from their cabins,<BR>
And the heroes ask these questions:<BR>
"Has a mine of gold been opened,<BR>
Hast thou found a vein of silver,<BR>
Precious jewels in thy pathway?<BR>
Does the forest yield her treasures,<BR>
Give to thee the Honey-eater?<BR>
Does the hostess of the woodlands,<BR>
Give to thee the lynx and adder,<BR>
Since thou comest home rejoicing,<BR>
Playing, singing, on thy snow-shoes?"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Gave this answer to his people:<BR>
"For his songs I caught the adder,<BR>
Caught the serpent for his wisdom;<BR>
Therefore do I come rejoicing,<BR>
Singing, playing, on my snow-shoes.<BR>
Not the mountain lynx, nor serpent,<BR>
Comes, however, to our dwellings;<BR>
The Illustrious is coming,<BR>
Pride and beauty of the forest,<BR>
'Tis the Master comes among us,<BR>
Covered with his friendly fur-robe.<BR>
Welcome, Otso, welcome, Light-foot,<BR>
Welcome, Loved-one from the glenwood!<BR>
If the mountain guest is welcome,<BR>
Open wide the gates of entry;<BR>
If the bear is thought unworthy,<BR>
Bar the doors against the stranger."<BR>
This the answer of the tribe-folk:<BR>
"We salute thee, mighty Otso,<BR>
Honey-paw, we bid thee welcome,<BR>
Welcome to our courts and cabins,<BR>
Welcome, Light-foot, to our tables<BR>
Decorated for thy coming!<BR>
We have wished for thee for ages,<BR>
Waiting since the days of childhood,<BR>
For the notes of Tapio's bugle,<BR>
For the singing of the wood-nymphs,<BR>
For the coming of dear Otso,<BR>
For the forest gold and silver,<BR>
Waiting for the year of plenty,<BR>
Longing for it as for summer,<BR>
As the shoe waits for the snow-fields,<BR>
As the sledge for beaten highways,<BR>
As the, maiden for her suitor,<BR>
And the wife her husband's coming;<BR>
Sat at evening by the windows,<BR>
At the gates have, sat at morning,<BR>
Sat for ages at the portals,<BR>
Near the granaries in winter, Vanished,<BR>
Till the snow-fields warmed and<BR>
Till the sails unfurled in joyance,<BR>
Till the earth grew green and blossomed,<BR>
Thinking all the while as follows:<BR>
"Where is our beloved Otso,<BR>
Why delays our forest-treasure?<BR>
Has he gone to distant Ehstland,<BR>
To the upper glens of Suomi?"<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Whither shall I lead the stranger,<BR>
Whither take the golden Light-foot?<BR>
Shall I lead him to the garner,<BR>
To the house of straw conduct him?"<BR>
This the answer of his tribe-folk:<BR>
"To the dining-hall lead Otso,<BR>
Greatest hero of the Northland.<BR>
Famous Light-foot, Forest-apple,<BR>
Pride and glory of the woodlands,<BR>
Have no fear before these maidens,<BR>
Fear not curly-headed virgins,<BR>
Clad in silver-tinselled raiment<BR>
Maidens hasten to their chambers<BR>
When dear Otso joins their number,<BR>
When the hero comes among them."<BR>
This the prayer of Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Grant, O Ukko, peace and plenty<BR>
Underneath these painted rafters,<BR>
In this ornamented dweling;<BR>
Thanks be paid to gracious Ukko!"<BR>
Spake again the ancient minstrel:<BR>
"Whither shall we lead dear Otso,<BR>
'Whither take the fur-clad stranger?<BR>
This the answer of his people:<BR>
"Hither let the fur-robed Light-foot<BR>
Be saluted on his coming;<BR>
Let the Honey-paw be welcomed<BR>
To the hearth-stone of the penthouse,<BR>
Welcomed to the boiling caldrons,<BR>
That we may admire his fur-robe,<BR>
May behold his cloak with joyance.<BR>
Have no care, thou much-loved Otso,<BR>
Let not anger swell thy bosom<BR>
As thy coat we view with pleasure;<BR>
We thy fur shall never injure,<BR>
Shall not make it into garments<BR>
To protect unworthy people."</P>
<P>Thereupon wise Wainamoinen<BR>
Pulled the sacred robe from Otso,<BR>
Spread it in the open court-yard,<BR>
Cut the, members into fragments,<BR>
Laid them in the heating caldrons,<BR>
In the copper-bottomed vessels-<BR>
O'er the fire the crane was hanging,<BR>
On the crane were hooks of copper,<BR>
On the hooks the broiling-vessels<BR>
Filled with bear-steak for the feasting, <BR>
Seasoned with the salt of Dwina,<BR>
From the Saxon-land imported,<BR>
From the distant Dwina-waters,<BR>
From the salt-sea brought in shallops.</P>
<P>Ready is the feast of Otso;<BR>
From the fire are swung the kettles<BR>
On the crane of polished iron;<BR>
In the centers of the tables<BR>
Is the bear displayed in dishes,<BR>
Golden dishes, decorated;<BR>
Of the fir-tree and the linden<BR>
Were the tables newly fashioned;<BR>
Drinking cups were forged from copper,<BR>
Knives of gold and spoons of silver;<BR>
Filled the vessels to their borders<BR>
With the choicest bits of Light-foot,<BR>
Fragments of the Forest-apple.<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
"Ancient one with bosom golden,<BR>
Potent voice in Tapio's councils<BR>
Metsola's most lovely hostess,<BR>
Hostess of the glen and forest,<BR>
Hero-son of Tapiola,<BR>
Stalwart youth in cap of scarlet,<BR>
Tapio's most beauteous virgin,<BR>
Fair Tellervo of the woodlands,<BR>
Metsola with all her people,<BR>
Come, and welcome, to the feasting,<BR>
To the marriage-feast of Otso!<BR>
All sufficient, the provisions,<BR>
Food to eat and drink abundant,<BR>
Plenty for the hosts assembled,<BR>
Plenty more to give the village."<BR>
This the question of the people:<BR>
"Tell us of the birth of Otso!<BR>
Was be born within a manger,<BR>
Was he nurtured in the bath-room<BR>
Was his origin ignoble?"<BR>
This is Wainamoinen's answer:<BR>
"Otso was not born a beggar,<BR>
Was not born among the rushes,<BR>
Was not cradled in a manger;<BR>
Honey-paw was born in ether,<BR>
In the regions of the Moon-land,<BR>
On the shoulders of Otava,<BR>
With the daughters of creation.</P>
<P>"Through the ether walked a maiden,<BR>
On the red rims of the cloudlets,<BR>
On the border of the heavens,<BR>
In her stockings purple-tinted,<BR>
In her golden-colored sandals.<BR>
In her hand she held a wool-box,<BR>
With a hair-box on her shoulder;<BR>
Threw the wool upon the ocean,<BR>
And the hair upon the rivers;<BR>
These are rocked by winds and waters,<BR>
Water-currents bear them onward,<BR>
Bear them to the sandy sea-shore,<BR>
Land them near the Woods of honey,<BR>
On an island forest-covered.</P>
<P>"Fair Mielikki, woodland hostess,<BR>
Tapio's most cunning daughter,<BR>
Took the fragments from the sea-side,<BR>
Took the white wool from the waters,<BR>
Sewed the hair and wool together,<BR>
Laid the bundle in her basket,<BR>
Basket made from bark of birch-wood,<BR>
Bound with cords the magic bundle;<BR>
With the chains of gold she bound it<BR>
To the pine-tree's topmost branches.<BR>
There she rocked the thing of magic,<BR>
Rocked to life the tender baby,<BR>
Mid the blossoms of the pine-tree,<BR>
On the fir-top set with needles;<BR>
Thus the young bear well was nurtured,<BR>
Thus was sacred Otso cradled<BR>
On the honey-tree of Northland,<BR>
In the middle of the forest.</P>
<P>"Sacred Otso grew and flourished,<BR>
Quickly grew with graceful movements,<BR>
Short of feet, with crooked ankles,<BR>
Wide of mouth and broad of forehead,<BR>
Short his nose, his fur-robe velvet;<BR>
But his claws were not well fashioned,<BR>
Neither were his teeth implanted.<BR>
Fair Mielikki, forest hostess,<BR>
Spake these words in meditation:<BR>
'Claws I should be pleased to give him,<BR>
And with teeth endow the wonder,<BR>
Would be not abuse the favor.'</P>
<P>"Swore the bear a promise sacred,<BR>
On his knees before Mielikki,<BR>
Hostess of the glen and forest,<BR>
And before omniscient Ukko,<BR>
First and last of all creators,<BR>
That he would not harm the worthy,<BR>
Never do a deed of evil.<BR>
Then Mielikki, woodland hostess,<BR>
Wisest maid of Tapiola,<BR>
Sought for teeth and claws to give him,<BR>
From the stoutest mountain-ashes,<BR>
From the juniper and oak tree,<BR>
From the dry knots of the alder.<BR>
Teeth and claws of these were worthless,<BR>
Would not render goodly service.</P>
<P>"Grew a fir-tree on the mountain,<BR>
Grew a stately pine in Northland,<BR>
And the fir had silver branches,<BR>
Bearing golden cones abundant;<BR>
These the sylvan maiden gathered,<BR>
Teeth and claws of these she fashioned<BR>
In the jaws and feet of Otso,<BR>
Set them for the best of uses.<BR>
Then she freed her new-made creature,<BR>
Let the Light-foot walk and wander,<BR>
Let him lumber through the marshes,<BR>
Let him amble through the forest,<BR>
Roll upon the plains and pastures;<BR>
Taught him how to walk a hero,<BR>
How to move with graceful motion,<BR>
How to live in ease and pleasure,<BR>
How to rest in full contentment,<BR>
In the moors and in the marshes,<BR>
On the borders of the woodlands;<BR>
How unshod to walk in summer,<BR>
Stockingless to run in autumn;<BR>
How to rest and sleep in winter<BR>
In the clumps of alder-bushes<BR>
Underneath the sheltering fir-tree,<BR>
Underneath the pine's protection,<BR>
Wrapped securely in his fur-robes,<BR>
With the juniper and willow.<BR>
This the origin of Otso,<BR>
Honey-eater of the Northlands,<BR>
Whence the sacred booty cometh.<BR>
Thus again the people questioned:<BR>
Why became the woods so gracious,<BR>
Why so generous and friendly?<BR>
Why is Tapio so humored,<BR>
That he gave his dearest treasure,<BR>
Gave to thee his Forest-apple,<BR>
Honey-eater of his kingdom?<BR>
Was he startled with thine arrows,<BR>
Frightened with the spear and broadsword?"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
Gave this answer to the question:<BR>
"Filled with kindness was the forest,<BR>
Glen and woodland full of greetings,<BR>
Tapio showing greatest favor.<BR>
Fair Mielikki, forest hostess,<BR>
Metsola's bewitching daughter,<BR>
Beauteous woodland maid, Tellervo,<BR>
Gladly led me on my journey,<BR>
Smoothed my pathway through the glen-wood.<BR>
Marked the trees upon the, mountains,<BR>
Pointing me to Otso's caverns,<BR>
To the Great Bear's golden island.</P>
<P>"When my journeyings had ended,<BR>
When the bear had been discovered,<BR>
Had no need to launch my javelins,<BR>
Did not need to aim the arrow;<BR>
Otso tumbled in his vaulting,<BR>
Lost his balance in his cradle,<BR>
In the fir-tree where he slumbered;<BR>
Tore his breast upon the branches,<BR>
Freely gave his life to others.</P>
<P>"Mighty Otso, my beloved,<BR>
Thou my golden friend and hero,<BR>
Take thy fur-cap from thy forehead,<BR>
Lay aside thy teeth forever,<BR>
Hide thy fingers in the darkness,<BR>
Close thy mouth and still thine anger,<BR>
While thy sacred skull is breaking.</P>
<P>"Now I take the eyes of Otso,<BR>
Lest he lose the sense of seeing,<BR>
Lest their former powers shall weaken;<BR>
Though I take not all his members,<BR>
Not alone must these be taken.</P>
<P>"Now I take the ears of Otso,<BR>
Lest he lose the sense of 'hearing,<BR>
Lest their former powers shall weaken;<BR>
Though I take not all his members,<BR>
Not alone must these be taken.</P>
<P>"Now I take the nose of Otso,<BR>
Lest he lose the sense of smelling,<BR>
Lest its former powers shall weaken;<BR>
Though I take not all his members,<BR>
Not alone must this be taken.</P>
<P>"Now I take the tongue of Otso,<BR>
Lest he lose the sense of tasting<BR>
Lest its former powers shall weaken;<BR>
Though I take not all his members,<BR>
Not alone must this be taken.</P>
<P>"Now I take the brain of Otso,<BR>
Lest he lose the means of thinking,<BR>
Lest his consciousness should fail him,<BR>
Lest his former instincts weaken;<BR>
Though I take not all his members,<BR>
Not alone must this be taken.</P>
<P>"I will reckon him a hero,<BR>
That will count the teeth of Light-foot,<BR>
That will loosen Otso's fingers<BR>
From their settings firmly fastened."</P>
<P>None he finds with strength sufficient<BR>
To perform the task demanded.<BR>
Therefore ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Counts the teeth of sacred Otso;<BR>
Loosens all the claws of Light-foot,<BR>
With his fingers strong as copper,<BR>
Slips them from their firm foundations,<BR>
Speaking to the bear these measures:<BR>
"Otso, thou my Honey-eater,<BR>
Thou my Fur-ball of the woodlands,<BR>
Onward, onward, must thou journey<BR>
From thy low and lonely dwelling,<BR>
To the court-rooms of the village.<BR>
Go, my treasure, through the pathway<BR>
Near the herds of swine and cattle,<BR>
To the hill-tops forest covered,<BR>
To the high and rising mountains,<BR>
To the spruce-trees filled with needles,<BR>
To the branches of the pine-tree;<BR>
There remain, my Forest-apple,<BR>
Linger there in lasting slumber,<BR>
Where the silver bells are ringing,<BR>
To the pleasure of the shepherd."</P>
<P>Thus beginning, and thus ending,<BR>
Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Hastened from his emptied tables,<BR>
And the children thus addressed him:<BR>
"Whither hast thou led thy booty,<BR>
Where hast left thy Forest-apple,<BR>
Sacred Otso of the woodlands?<BR>
Hast thou left him on the iceberg,<BR>
Buried him upon the snow-field?<BR>
Hast thou sunk him in the quicksand,<BR>
Laid him low beneath the heather?"<BR>
Wainamoinen spake in answer:<BR>
"Have not left him on the iceberg,<BR>
Have not buried him in snow-fields;<BR>
There the dogs would soon devour him,<BR>
Birds of prey would feast upon him;<BR>
Have not hidden him in Swamp-land,<BR>
Have not buried him in heather;<BR>
There the worms would live upon him,<BR>
Insects feed upon his body.<BR>
Thither I have taken Otso,<BR>
To the summit of the Gold-hill,<BR>
To the copper-bearing mountain,<BR>
Laid him in his silken cradle<BR>
In the summit of a pine-tree,<BR>
Where the winds and sacred branches<BR>
Rock him to his lasting slumber,<BR>
To the pleasure of the hunter,<BR>
To the joy of man and hero.<BR>
To the east his lips are pointing,<BR>
While his eyes are northward looking;<BR>
But dear Otso looks not upward,<BR>
For the fierceness of the storm-winds<BR>
Would destroy his sense of vision."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Touched again his harp of joyance,<BR>
Sang again his songs enchanting,<BR>
To the pleasure of the evening,<BR>
To the joy of morn arising.<BR>
Spake the singer of Wainola:<BR>
"Light for me a torch of pine-wood,<BR>
For the darkness is appearing,<BR>
That my playing may be joyous<BR>
And my wisdom-songs find welcome."</P>
<P>Then the ancient sage and singer,<BR>
Wise and worthy Wainamoinen,<BR>
Sweetly sang and played, and chanted,<BR>
Through the long and dreary evening,<BR>
Ending thus his incantation:<BR>
"Grant, O Ukko, my Creator,<BR>
That the people of Wainola<BR>
May enjoy another banquet<BR>
In the company of Light-foot;<BR>
Grant that we may long remember<BR>
Kalevala's feast with Otso!</P>
<P>"Grant, O Ukko, my Creator,<BR>
That the signs may guide our footsteps,<BR>
That the notches in the pine-tree<BR>
May direct my faithful people<BR>
To the bear-dens of the woodlands;<BR>
That great Tapio's sacred bugle<BR>
May resound through glen and forest;<BR>
That the wood-nymph's call may echo,<BR>
May be heard in field and hamlet,<BR>
To the joy of all that listen!<BR>
Let great Tapio's horn for ages<BR>
Ring throughout the fen and forest,<BR>
Through the hills and dales of Northland<BR>
O'er the meadows and the mountains,<BR>
To awaken song and gladness<BR>
In the forests of Wainola,<BR>
On the snowy plains of Suomi,<BR>
On the meads of Kalevala,<BR>
For the coming generations."</P>
