<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE ISLE OF REFUGE.</H1>
<P>LEMMINKAINEN, full of joyance,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,<BR>
Took provisions in abundance,<BR>
Fish and butter, bread and bacon,<BR>
Hastened to the Isle of Refuge,<BR>
Sailed away across the oceans,<BR>
Spake these measures on departing:<BR>
"Fare thee well, mine Island-dwelling,<BR>
I must sail to other borders,<BR>
To an island more protective,<BR>
Till the second summer passes;<BR>
Let the serpents keep the island,<BR>
Lynxes rest within the glen-wood,<BR>
Let the blue-moose roam the mountains,<BR>
Let the wild-geese cat the barley.<BR>
Fare thee well, my helpful mother!<BR>
When the warriors of the Northland,<BR>
From the dismal Sariola,<BR>
Come with swords, and spears, and cross-bows,<BR>
Asking for my head in vengeance,<BR>
Say that I have long departed,<BR>
Left my mother's Island-dwelling,<BR>
When the barley had been garnered."</P>
<P>Then he launched his boat of copper,<BR>
Threw the vessel to the waters,<BR>
From the iron-banded rollers,<BR>
From the cylinders of oak-wood,<BR>
On the masts the sails he hoisted,<BR>
Spread the magic sails of linen,<BR>
In the stern the hero settled<BR>
And prepared to sail his vessel,<BR>
One hand resting on the rudder.</P>
<P>Then the sailor spake as follows,<BR>
These the words of Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Blow, ye winds, and drive me onward,<BR>
Blow ye steady, winds of heaven,<BR>
Toward the island in the ocean,<BR>
That my bark may fly in safety<BR>
To my father's place of refuge,<BR>
To the far and nameless island!"</P>
<P>Soon the winds arose as bidden,<BR>
Rocked the vessel o'er the billows,<BR>
O'er the blue-back of the waters,<BR>
O'er the vast expanse of ocean;<BR>
Blew two months and blew unceasing,<BR>
Blew a third month toward the island,<BR>
Toward his father's Isle of Refuge.</P>
<P>Sat some maidens on the seaside,<BR>
On the sandy beach of ocean,<BR>
Turned about in all directions,<BR>
Looking out upon the billows;<BR>
One was waiting for her brother,<BR>
And a second for her father,<BR>
And a third one, anxious, waited<BR>
For the, coming of her suitor;<BR>
There they spied young Lemminkainen,<BR>
There perceived the hero's vessel<BR>
Sailing o'er the bounding billows;<BR>
It was like a hanging cloudlet,<BR>
Hanging twixt the earth and heaven.</P>
<P>Thus the island-maidens wondered,<BR>
Thus they spake to one another:<BR>
"What this stranger on the ocean,<BR>
What is this upon the waters?<BR>
Art thou one of our sea-vessels?<BR>
Wert thou builded on this island?<BR>
Sail thou straightway to the harbor,<BR>
To the island-point of landing<BR>
That thy tribe may be discovered."</P>
<P>Onward did the waves propel it,<BR>
Rocked his vessel o'er the billows,<BR>
Drove it to the magic island,<BR>
Safely landed Lemminkainen<BR>
On the sandy shore and harbor.</P>
<P>Spake he thus when he had landed,<BR>
These the words that Ahti uttered:<BR>
"Is there room upon this island,<BR>
Is there space within this harbor,<BR>
Where my bark may lie at anchor,<BR>
Where the sun may dry my vessel?"</P>
<P>This the answer of the virgins,<BR>
Dwellers on the Isle of Refuge:<BR>
"There is room within this harbor,<BR>
On this island, space abundant,<BR>
Where thy bark may lie at anchor,<BR>
Where the sun may dry thy vessel;<BR>
Lying ready are the rollers,<BR>
Cylinders adorned with copper;<BR>
If thou hadst a hundred vessels,<BR>
Shouldst thou come with boats a thousand,<BR>
We would give them room in welcome."</P>
<P>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Rolled his vessel in the harbor,<BR>
On the cylinders of copper,<BR>
Spake these words when he had ended:<BR>
"Is there room upon this island,<BR>
Or a spot within these forests,<BR>
Where a hero may be hidden<BR>
From the coming din of battle,<BR>
From the play of spears and arrows?<BR>
Thus replied the Island-maidens:<BR>
"There are places on this island,<BR>
On these plains a spot befitting<BR>
Where to hide thyself in safety,<BR>
Hero-son of little valor.<BR>
Here are many, many castles,<BR>
Many courts upon this island;<BR>
Though there come a thousand heroes,<BR>
Though a thousand spearmen. follow,<BR>
Thou canst hide thyself in safety."<BR>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Is there room upon this island,<BR>
Where the birch-tree grows abundant,<BR>
Where this son may fell the forest,<BR>
And may cultivate the fallow? "<BR>
Answered thus the Island-maidens:<BR>
"There is not a spot befitting,<BR>
Not a place upon the island,<BR>
Where to rest thy wearied members,<BR>
Not the smallest patch of birch-wood,<BR>
Thou canst bring to cultivation.<BR>
All our fields have been divided,<BR>
All these woods have been apportioned,<BR>
Fields and forests have their owners."</P>
<P>Lemminkainen asked this question,<BR>
These the words of Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Is there room upon this island,<BR>
Worthy spot in field or forest,<BR>
Where to Sing my songs of magic,<BR>
Chant my gathered store of wisdom,<BR>
Sing mine ancient songs and legends?"<BR>
Answered thus the Island-maidens:<BR>
"There is room upon this island,<BR>
Worthy place in these dominions,<BR>
Thou canst sing thy garnered wisdom,<BR>
Thou canst chant thine ancient legends,<BR>
Legends of the times primeval,<BR>
In the forest, in the castle,<BR>
On the island-plains and pastures."</P>
<P>Then began the reckless minstrel<BR>
To intone his wizard-sayings;<BR>
Sang he alders to the waysides,<BR>
Sang the oaks upon the mountains,<BR>
On the oak-trees sang be branches,<BR>
On each branch he sang an acorn,<BR>
On the acorns, golden rollers,<BR>
On each roller, sang a cuckoo;<BR>
Then began the cuckoos, calling,<BR>
Gold from every throat came streaming,<BR>
Copper fell from every feather,<BR>
And each wing emitted silver,<BR>
Filled the isle with precious metals.<BR>
Sang again young Lemminkainen,<BR>
Conjured on, and sang, and chanted,<BR>
Sang to precious stones the sea-sands,<BR>
Sang the stones to pearls resplendent,<BR>
Robed the groves in iridescence,<BR>
Sang the island full of flowers,<BR>
Many-colored as the rainbow.<BR>
Sang again the magic minstrel,<BR>
In the court a well he conjured,<BR>
On the well a golden cover,<BR>
On the lid a silver dipper,<BR>
That the boys might drink the water,<BR>
That the maids might lave their eyelids.<BR>
On the plains he conjured lakelets,<BR>
Sang the duck upon the waters,<BR>
Golden-cheeked and silver-headed,<BR>
Sang the feet from shining copper;<BR>
And the Island-maidens wondered,<BR>
Stood entranced at Ahti's wisdom,<BR>
At the songs of Lemminkainen,<BR>
At the hero's magic power.</P>
<P>Spake the singer, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<BR>
"I would sing a wondrous legend,<BR>
Sing in miracles of sweetness,<BR>
If within some hall or chamber,<BR>
I were seated at the table.<BR>
If I sing not in the castle,<BR>
In some spot by walls surrounded<BR>
Then I sing my songs to zephyrs,<BR>
Fling them to the fields and forests."<BR>
Answered thus the Island-maidens:<BR>
"On this isle are castle-chambers,<BR>
Halls for use of magic singers,<BR>
Courts complete for chanting legends,<BR>
Where thy singing will be welcome,<BR>
Where thy songs will not be scattered<BR>
To the forests of the island,<BR>
Nor thy wisdom lost in ether."</P>
<P>Straightway Lemminkainen journeyed<BR>
With the maidens to the castle;<BR>
There he sang and conjured pitchers<BR>
On the borders of the tables,<BR>
Sang and conjured golden goblets<BR>
Foaming with the beer of barley;<BR>
Sang he many well-filled vessels,<BR>
Bowls of honey-drink abundant,<BR>
Sweetest butter, toothsome biscuit,<BR>
Bacon, fish, and veal, and venison,<BR>
All the dainties of the Northland,<BR>
Wherewithal to still his hunger.<BR>
But the proud-heart, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Was not ready for the banquet,<BR>
Did not yet begin his feasting,<BR>
Waited for a knife of silver,<BR>
For a knife of golden handle;<BR>
Quick he sang the precious metals,<BR>
Sang a blade from purest silver,<BR>
To the blade a golden handle,<BR>
Straightway then began his feasting,<BR>
Quenched his thirst and stilled his hunger,<BR>
Charmed the maidens on the island.</P>
<P>Then the minstrel, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Roamed throughout the island-hamlets,<BR>
To the joy of all the virgins,<BR>
All the maids of braided tresses;<BR>
Wheresoe'er he turned his footsteps,<BR>
There appeared a maid to greet him;<BR>
When his hand was kindly offered,<BR>
There his band was kindly taken;<BR>
When he wandered out at evening,<BR>
Even in the darksome places,<BR>
There the maidens bade him welcome;<BR>
There was not an island-village<BR>
Where there were not seven castles,<BR>
In each castle seven daughters,<BR>
And the daughters stood in waiting,<BR>
Gave the hero joyful greetings,<BR>
Only one of all the maidens<BR>
Whom he did not greet with pleasure.</P>
<P>Thus the merry Lemminkainen<BR>
Spent three summers in the ocean,<BR>
Spent a merry time in refuge,<BR>
In the hamlets on the island,<BR>
To the pleasure of the maidens,<BR>
To the joy of all the daughters;<BR>
Only one was left neglected,<BR>
She a poor and graceless spinster,<BR>
On the isle's remotest border,<BR>
In the smallest of the hamlets.</P>
<P>'Then he thought about his journey<BR>
O'er the ocean to his mother,<BR>
To the cottage of his father.<BR>
There appeared the slighted spinster,<BR>
To the Northland son departing,<BR>
Spake these words to Lemminkainen:<BR>
"O, thou handsome Kaukomieli,<BR>
Wisdom-bard, and magic singer,<BR>
Since this maiden thou hast slighted,<BR>
May the winds destroy thy vessel,<BR>
Dash thy bark to countless fragments<BR>
On the ocean-rocks and ledges!"</P>
<P>Lemminkainen's thoughts were homeward,<BR>
Did not heed the maiden's murmurs,<BR>
Did not rise before the dawning<BR>
Of the morning on the island,<BR>
To the pleasure of the maiden<BR>
Of the much-neglected hamlet.<BR>
Finally at close of evening,<BR>
He resolved to leave the island,<BR>
He resolved to waken early,<BR>
Long before the dawn of morning;<BR>
Long before the time appointed,<BR>
He arose that he might wander<BR>
Through the hamlets of the island,<BR>
Bid adieu to all the maidens,<BR>
On the morn of his departure.<BR>
As he wandered hither, thither,<BR>
Walking through the village path-ways<BR>
To the last of all the hamlets;<BR>
Saw he none of all the castle-,<BR>
Where three dwellings were not standing;<BR>
Saw he none of all the dwellings<BR>
Where three heroes were not watching;<BR>
Saw he none of all the heroes,<BR>
Who was not engaged in grinding<BR>
Swords, and spears, and battle-axes,<BR>
For the death of Lemminkainen.<BR>
And these words the hero uttered:<BR>
"Now alas! the Sun arises<BR>
From his couch within the ocean,<BR>
On the frailest of the heroes,<BR>
On the saddest child of Northland;<BR>
On my neck the cloak of Lempo<BR>
Might protect me from all evil,<BR>
Though a hundred foes assail me,<BR>
Though a thousand archers follow."</P>
<P>Then he left the maids ungreeted,<BR>
Left his longing for the daughters<BR>
Of the nameless Isle of Refuge,<BR>
With his farewell-words unspoken,<BR>
Hastened toward the island-harbor,<BR>
Toward his magic bark at anchor;<BR>
But he found it burned to ashes,<BR>
Sweet revenge had fired his vessel,<BR>
Lighted by the slighted spinster.<BR>
Then he saw the dawn of evil,<BR>
Saw misfortune hanging over,<BR>
Saw destruction round about him.<BR>
Straightway he began rebuilding<BR>
Him a magic sailing-vessel,<BR>
New and wondrous, full of beauty;<BR>
But the hero needed timber,<BR>
Boards, and planks, and beams, and braces,<BR>
Found the smallest bit of lumber,<BR>
Found of boards but seven fragments,<BR>
Of a spool he found three pieces,<BR>
Found six pieces of the distaff;<BR>
With these fragments builds his vessel,<BR>
Builds a ship of magic virtue,<BR>
Builds the bark with secret knowledge,<BR>
Through the will of the magician;<BR>
Strikes one blow, and builds the first part,<BR>
Strikes a second, builds the centre,<BR>
Strikes a third with wondrous power,<BR>
And the vessel is completed.</P>
<P>Thereupon the ship he launches,<BR>
Sings the vessel to the ocean,<BR>
And these words the hero utters:<BR>
"Like a bubble swim these waters,<BR>
Like a flower ride the billows;<BR>
Loan me of thy magic feathers,<BR>
Three, O eagle, four, O raven,<BR>
For protection to my vessel,<BR>
Lest it flounder in the ocean!"</P>
<P>Now the sailor, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Seats himself upon the bottom<BR>
Of the vessel he has builded,<BR>
Hastens on his journey homeward,<BR>
Head depressed and evil-humored,<BR>
Cap awry upon his forehead,<BR>
Mind dejected, heavy-hearted,<BR>
That he could not dwell forever<BR>
In the castles of the daughters<BR>
Of the nameless Isle of Refuge.</P>
<P>Spake the minstrel, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:<BR>
"Leave I must this merry island,<BR>
Leave her many joys and pleasures,<BR>
Leave her maids with braided tresses,<BR>
Leave her dances and her daughters,<BR>
To the joys of other heroes;<BR>
But I take this comfort with me:<BR>
All the maidens on the island,<BR>
Save the spinster who was slighted,<BR>
Will bemoan my loss for ages,<BR>
Will regret my quick departure;<BR>
They will miss me at the dances,<BR>
In the halls of mirth and joyance,<BR>
In the homes of merry maidens,<BR>
On my father's Isle of Refuge."</P>
<P>Wept the maidens on the island,<BR>
Long lamenting, loudly calling<BR>
To the hero sailing homeward:<BR>
"Whither goest, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Why depart, thou best of heroes?<BR>
Dost thou leave from inattention,<BR>
Is there here a dearth of maidens,<BR>
Have our greetings been unworthy?"</P>
<P>Sang the magic Lemminkainen<BR>
To the maids as he was sailing,<BR>
This in answer to their calling:<BR>
"Leaving not for want of pleasure,<BR>
Do not go from dearth of women<BR>
Beautiful the island-maidens,<BR>
Countless as the sands their virtues.<BR>
This the reason of my going,<BR>
I am longing for my home-land,<BR>
Longing for my mother's cabins,<BR>
For the strawberries of Northland,<BR>
For the raspberries of Kalew,<BR>
For the maidens of my childhood,<BR>
For the children of my mother."</P>
<P>Then the merry Lemminkainen<BR>
Bade farewell to all the island;<BR>
Winds arose and drove his vessel<BR>
On the blue-back of the ocean,<BR>
O'er the far-extending waters,<BR>
Toward the island of his mother.<BR>
On the shore were grouped the daughters<BR>
Of the magic Isle of Refuge,<BR>
On the rocks sat the forsaken,<BR>
Weeping stood the island-maidens,<BR>
Golden daughters, loud-lamenting.<BR>
Weep the maidens of the island<BR>
While the sail-yards greet their vision,<BR>
While the copper-beltings glisten;<BR>
Do not weep to lose the sail-yards,<BR>
Nor to lose the copper-beltings;<BR>
Weep they for the loss of Ahti,<BR>
For the fleeing Kaukomieli<BR>
Guiding the departing vessel.<BR>
Also weeps young Lemminkainen,<BR>
Sorely weeps, and loud-lamenting,<BR>
Weeps while he can see the island,<BR>
While the island hill-tops glisten;<BR>
Does not mourn the island-mountains,<BR>
Weeps he only for the maidens,<BR>
Left upon the Isle of Refuge.</P>
<P>Thereupon sailed Kaukomieli<BR>
On the blue-back of the ocean;<BR>
Sailed one day, and then a second,<BR>
But, alas! upon the third day,<BR>
There arose a mighty storm-wind,<BR>
And the sky was black with fury.<BR>
Blew the black winds from the north-west,<BR>
From the south-east came the whirlwind,<BR>
Tore away the ship's forecastle,<BR>
Tore away the vessel's rudder,<BR>
Dashed the wooden hull to pieces.<BR>
Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<BR>
Headlong fell upon the waters;<BR>
With his head he did the steering,<BR>
With his hands and feet, the rowing;<BR>
Swam whole days and nights unceasing,<BR>
Swam with hope and strength united,<BR>
Till at last appeared a cloudlet,<BR>
Growing cloudlet to the westward,<BR>
Changing to a promontory,<BR>
Into land within the ocean.</P>
<P>Swiftly to the shore swam Ahti,<BR>
Hastened to a magic castle,<BR>
Found therein a hostess baking,<BR>
And her daughters kneading barley,<BR>
And these words the hero uttered:<BR>
"O, thou hostess, filled with kindness,<BR>
Couldst thou know my pangs of hunger,<BR>
Couldst thou guess my name and station,<BR>
Thou wouldst hasten to the storehouse,<BR>
Bring me beer and foaming liquor,<BR>
Bring the best of thy provisions,<BR>
Bring me fish, and veal, and bacon,<BR>
Butter, bread, and honeyed biscuits,<BR>
Set for me a wholesome dinner,<BR>
Wherewithal to still my hunger,<BR>
Quench the thirst of Lemminkainen.<BR>
Days and nights have I been swimming,<BR>
Buffeting the waves of ocean,<BR>
Seemed as if the wind protected,<BR>
And the billows gave me shelter,"</P>
<P>Then the hostess, filled with kindness,<BR>
Hastened to the mountain storehouse,<BR>
Cut some butter, veal, and bacon,<BR>
Bread, and fish, and honeyed biscuit,<BR>
Brought the best of her provisions,<BR>
Brought the mead and beer of barley,<BR>
Set for him a toothsome dinner,<BR>
Wherewithal to still his hunger,<BR>
Quench the thirst of Lemminkainen.</P>
<P>When the hero's feast had ended,<BR>
Straightway was a magic vessel<BR>
Given by the kindly hostess<BR>
To the weary Kaukomieli,<BR>
Bark of beauty, new and hardy,<BR>
Wherewithal to aid the stranger<BR>
In his journey to his home-land,<BR>
To the cottage of his mother.</P>
<P>Quickly sailed wild Lemminkainen<BR>
On the blue-back of the ocean;<BR>
Sailed he days and nights unceasing,<BR>
Till at last he reached the borders<BR>
Of his own loved home and country;<BR>
There beheld he scenes familiar,<BR>
Saw the islands, capes, and rivers,<BR>
Saw his former shipping-stations,<BR>
Saw he many ancient landmarks,<BR>
Saw the mountains with their fir-trees,<BR>
Saw the pine-trees on the hill-tops,<BR>
Saw the willows in the lowlands;<BR>
Did not see his father's cottage,<BR>
Nor the dwellings of his mother.<BR>
Where a mansion once had risen,<BR>
There the alder-trees were growing,<BR>
Shrubs were growing on the homestead,<BR>
Junipers within the court-yard.<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:<BR>
"In this glen I played and wandered,<BR>
On these stones I rocked for ages,<BR>
On this lawn I rolled and tumbled,<BR>
Frolicked on these woodland-borders,<BR>
When a child of little stature.<BR>
Where then is my mother's dwelling,<BR>
Where the castles of my father?<BR>
Fire, I fear, has found the hamlet,<BR>
And the winds dispersed the ashes."</P>
<P>Then he fell to bitter weeping,<BR>
Wept one day and then a second,<BR>
Wept the third day without ceasing;<BR>
Did not mourn the ancient homestead,<BR>
Nor the dwellings of his father;<BR>
Wept he for his darling mother,<BR>
Wept he for the dear departed,<BR>
For the loved ones of the island.</P>
<P>Then he saw the bird of heaven,<BR>
Saw an eagle flying near him,<BR>
And he asked the bird this question:<BR>
"Mighty eagle, bird majestic,<BR>
Grant to me the information,<BR>
Where my mother may have wandered,<BR>
Whither I may go and find her!"</P>
<P>But the eagle knew but little,<BR>
Only knew that Ahti's people<BR>
Long ago together perished;<BR>
And the raven also answered<BR>
That his people had been scattered<BR>
By the, swords, and spears, and arrows,<BR>
Of his enemies from Pohya.<BR>
Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Faithful mother, dear departed,<BR>
Thou who nursed me in my childhood,<BR>
Art thou dead and turned to ashes,<BR>
Didst thou perish for my follies,<BR>
O'er thy head are willows weeping,<BR>
Junipers above thy body,<BR>
Alders watching o'er thy slumbers?<BR>
This my punishment for evil,<BR>
This the recompense of folly!<BR>
Fool was I, a son unworthy,<BR>
That I measured swords in Northland<BR>
With the landlord of Pohyola,<BR>
To my tribe came fell destruction,<BR>
And the death of my dear mother,<BR>
Through my crimes and misdemeanors."</P>
<P>Then the ministrel <I>[sic]</I> looked about him,<BR>
Anxious, looked in all directions,<BR>
And beheld some gentle foot-prints,<BR>
Saw a pathway lightly trodden<BR>
Where the heather had been beaten.<BR>
Quick as thought the path he followed,<BR>
Through the meadows, through the brambles,<BR>
O'er the hills, and through the valleys,<BR>
To a forest, vast and cheerless;<BR>
Travelled far and travelled farther,<BR>
Still a greater distance travelled,<BR>
To a dense and hidden glenwood,<BR>
In the middle of the island;<BR>
Found therein a sheltered cabin,<BR>
Found a small and darksome dwelling<BR>
Built between the rocky ledges,<BR>
In the midst of triple pine-trees;<BR>
And within he spied his mother,<BR>
Found his gray-haired mother weeping.</P>
<P>Lemminkainen loud rejoices,<BR>
Cries in tones of joyful greetings,<BR>
These the words that Ahti utters:<BR>
"Faithful mother, well-beloved,<BR>
Thou that gavest me existence,<BR>
Happy I, that thou art living,<BR>
That thou hast not yet departed<BR>
To the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
To the islands of the blessed,<BR>
I had thought that thou hadst perished,<BR>
Hadst been murdered by my foemen,<BR>
Hadst been slain with bows and arrows.<BR>
Heavy are mine eyes from weeping,<BR>
And my checks are white with sorrow,<BR>
Since I thought my mother slaughtered<BR>
For the sins I had committed!"<BR>
Lemminkainen's mother answered:<BR>
"Long, indeed, hast thou been absent,<BR>
Long, my son, hast thou been living<BR>
In thy father's Isle of Refuge,<BR>
Roaming on the secret island,<BR>
Living at the doors of strangers,<BR>
Living in a nameless country,<BR>
Refuge from the Northland foemen."<BR>
Spake the, hero, Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Charming is that spot for living,<BR>
Beautiful the magic island,<BR>
Rainbow-colored was the forest,<BR>
Blue the glimmer of the meadows,<BR>
Silvered were, the pine-tree branches,<BR>
Golden were the heather-blossoms;<BR>
All the woodlands dripped with honey,<BR>
Eggs in every rock and crevice,<BR>
Honey flowed from birch and sorb-tree,<BR>
Milk in streams from fir and aspen,<BR>
Beer-foam dripping from the willows,<BR>
Charming there to live and linger,<BR>
All their edibles delicious.<BR>
This their only source of trouble:<BR>
Great the fear for all the maidens,<BR>
All the heroes filled with envy,<BR>
Feared the coming of the stranger;<BR>
Thought that all the island-maidens,<BR>
Thought that all the wives and daughters,<BR>
All the good, and all the evil,<BR>
Gave thy son too much attention;<BR>
Thought the stranger, Lemminkainen,<BR>
Saw the Island-maids too often;<BR>
Yet the virgins I avoided,<BR>
Shunned the good and shunned the evil,<BR>
Shunned the host of charming daughters,<BR>
As the black-wolf shuns the sheep-fold,<BR>
As the hawk neglects the chickens."</P>
