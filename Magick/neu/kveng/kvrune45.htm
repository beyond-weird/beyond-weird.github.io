<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">BIRTH OF THE NINE DISEASES</H1>
<P>LOUHI, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Heard the word in Sariola,<BR>
Heard the Dews with ears of envy,<BR>
That Wainola lives and prospers,<BR>
That Osmoinen's wealth increases,<BR>
Through the ruins of the Sampo,<BR>
Ruins of the lid in colors.<BR>
Thereupon her wrath she kindled,<BR>
Well considered, long reflected,<BR>
How she might prepare destruction<BR>
For the people of Wainola,<BR>
For the tribes of Kalevala.</P>
<P>With this prayer she turns to Ukko,<BR>
Thus entreats the god of thunder:<BR>
"Ukko, thou who art in heaven,<BR>
Help me slay Wainola's people<BR>
With thine iron-hail of justice,<BR>
With thine arrows tipped with lightning,<BR>
Or from sickness let them perish,<BR>
Let them die the death deserving;<BR>
Let the men die in the forest,<BR>
And the women in the hurdles!"</P>
<P>The blind daughter of Tuoni,<BR>
Old and wicked witch, Lowyatar,<BR>
Worst of all the Death-land women,<BR>
Ugliest of Mana's children,<BR>
Source of all the host of evils,<BR>
All the ills and plagues of Northland,<BR>
Black in heart, and soul, and visage,<BR>
Evil genius of Lappala,<BR>
Made her couch along the wayside,<BR>
On the fields of sin and sorrow;<BR>
Turned her back upon the East-wind,<BR>
To the source of stormy weather,<BR>
To the chilling winds of morning.</P>
<P>When the winds arose at evening,<BR>
Heavy-laden grew Lowyatar,<BR>
Through the east-wind's impregnation,<BR>
On the sand-plains, vast and barren.<BR>
Long she bore her weight of trouble,<BR>
Many morns she suffered anguish,<BR>
Till at last she leaves the desert,<BR>
Makes her couch within the forest,<BR>
On a rock upon the mountain;<BR>
Labors long to leave her burden<BR>
By the mountain-springs and fountains,<BR>
By the crystal waters flowing,<BR>
By the sacred stream and whirlpool,<BR>
By the cataract and fire-stream;<BR>
But her burden does not lighten.<BR>
Blind Lowyatar, old and ugly,<BR>
Knew not where to look for succor,<BR>
How to lose her weight of sorrow,<BR>
Where to lay her evil children.</P>
<P>Spake the Highest from the heavens,<BR>
These, the words of mighty Ukko:<BR>
"Is a triangle in Swamp-field,<BR>
Near the border of the ocean,<BR>
In the never-pleasant Northland,<BR>
In the dismal Sariola;<BR>
Thither go and lay thy burden,<BR>
In Pohyola leave thine offspring;<BR>
There the Laplanders await thee,<BR>
There will bid thy children welcome."</P>
<P>Thereupon the blind Lowyatar,<BR>
Blackest daughter of Tuoni,<BR>
Mana's old and ugly maiden,<BR>
Hastened on her journey northward,<BR>
To the chambers of Pohyola,<BR>
To the ancient halls of Louhi,<BR>
There to lay her heavy burdens,<BR>
There to leave her evil offspring.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Old and toothless witch of Pohya,<BR>
Takes Lowyatar to her mansion;<BR>
Silently she leads the stranger<BR>
To the bath-rooms of her chamber,<BR>
Pours the foaming beer of barley,<BR>
Lubricates the bolts and hinges,<BR>
That their movements may be secret,<BR>
Speaks these measures to Lowyatar:<BR>
"Faithful daughter of Creation,<BR>
Thou most beautiful of women,<BR>
First and last of ancient mothers,<BR>
Hasten on thy feet to ocean,<BR>
To the ocean's centre hasten,<BR>
Take the sea-foam from the waters,<BR>
Take the honey of the mermaids,<BR>
And anoint thy sacred members,<BR>
That thy labors may be lightened.</P>
<P>"Should all this be unavailing,<BR>
Ukko, thou who art in heaven,<BR>
Hasten hither, thou art needed,<BR>
Come thou to thy child in trouble,<BR>
Help the helpless and afflicted.<BR>
Take thy golden-colored sceptre,<BR>
Charm away opposing forces,<BR>
Strike the pillars of the stronghold,<BR>
Open all resisting portals,<BR>
That the great and small may wander<BR>
From their ancient hiding-places,<BR>
Through the courts and halls of freedom."</P>
<P>Finally the blind Lowyatar,<BR>
Wicked witch of Tuonela,<BR>
Was delivered of her burden,<BR>
Laid her offspring in the cradle,<BR>
Underneath the golden covers.<BR>
Thus at last were born nine children,<BR>
In an evening of the summer,<BR>
From Lowyatar, blind and ancient,<BR>
Ugly daughter of Tuoni.<BR>
Faithfully the virgin-mother<BR>
Guards her children in affection,<BR>
As an artist loves and nurses<BR>
What his skillful hands have fashioned.</P>
<P>Thus Lowyatar named her offspring,<BR>
Colic, Pleurisy, and Fever,<BR>
Ulcer, Plague, and dread Consumption,<BR>
Gout, Sterility, and Cancer.<BR>
And the worst of these nine children<BR>
Blind Lowyatar quickly banished,<BR>
Drove away as an enchanter,<BR>
To bewitch the lowland people,<BR>
To engender strife and envy.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Banished all the other children<BR>
To the fog-point in the ocean,<BR>
To the island forest-covered;<BR>
Banished all the fatal creatures,<BR>
Gave these wicked sons of evil<BR>
To the people of Wainola,<BR>
To the youth of Kalevala,<BR>
For the Kalew-tribe's destruction.<BR>
Quick Wainola's maidens sicken,<BR>
Young and aged, men and heroes,<BR>
With the worst of all diseases,<BR>
With diseases new and nameless;<BR>
Sick and dying is Wainola.</P>
<P>Thereupon old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Wise and wonderful enchanter,<BR>
Hastens to his people's rescue,<BR>
Hastens to a war with Mana,<BR>
To a conflict with Tuoni,<BR>
To destroy the evil children<BR>
Of the evil maid, Lowyatar.<BR>
Wainamoinen heats the bath-rooms,<BR>
Heats the blocks of healing-sandstone<BR>
With the magic wood of Northland,<BR>
Gathered by the sacred river;<BR>
Water brings in covered buckets<BR>
From the cataract and whirlpool;<BR>
Brooms he brings enwrapped with ermine,<BR>
Well the bath the healer cleanses,<BR>
Softens well the brooms of birch-wood;<BR>
Then a honey-heat be wakens,<BR>
Fills the rooms with healing vapors,<BR>
From the virtue of the pebbles<BR>
Glowing in the heat of magic,<BR>
Thus he speaks in supplication:<BR>
"Come, O Ukko, to my rescue,<BR>
God of mercy, lend thy presence,<BR>
Give these vapor-baths new virtues,<BR>
Grant to them the powers of healing,<BR>
And restore my dying people;<BR>
Drive away these fell diseases,<BR>
Banish them to the unworthy,<BR>
Let the holy sparks enkindle,<BR>
Keep this heat in healing limits,<BR>
That it may not harm thy children,<BR>
May not injure the afflicted.<BR>
When I pour the sacred waters<BR>
On the heated blocks of sandstone,<BR>
May the water turn to honey<BR>
Laden with the balm of healing.<BR>
Let the stream of magic virtues<BR>
Ceaseless flow to all my children,<BR>
From this bath enrolled in sea-moss,<BR>
That the guiltless may not suffer,<BR>
That my tribe-folk may not perish,<BR>
Till the Master gives permission,<BR>
Until Ukko sends his minions,<BR>
Sends diseases of his choosing,<BR>
To destroy my trusting people.<BR>
Let the hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Wicked witch that sent these troubles,<BR>
Suffer from a gnawing conscience,<BR>
Suffer for her evil doings.<BR>
Should the Master of Wainola<BR>
Lose his magic skill and weaken,<BR>
Should he prove of little service<BR>
To deliver from misfortune,<BR>
To deliver from these evils,<BR>
Then may Ukko be our healer,<BR>
Be our strength and wise Physician.</P>
<P>"Omnipresent God of mercy,<BR>
Thou who livest in the heavens,<BR>
Hasten hither, thou art needed,<BR>
Hasten to thine ailing children,<BR>
To observe their cruel tortures,<BR>
To dispel these fell diseases,<BR>
Drive destruction from our borders.<BR>
Bring with thee thy mighty fire-sword,<BR>
Bring to me thy blade of lightning,<BR>
That I may subdue these evils,<BR>
That these monsters I may banish,<BR>
Send these pains, and ills, and tortures,<BR>
To the empire of Tuoni,<BR>
To the kingdom of the east-winds,<BR>
To the islands of the wicked,<BR>
To the caverns of the demons,<BR>
To the rocks within the mountains,<BR>
To the hidden beds of iron,<BR>
That the rocks may fall and sicken,<BR>
And the beds of iron perish.<BR>
Rocks and metals do not murmur<BR>
At the hands of the invader.</P>
<P>"Torture-daughter of Tuoni,<BR>
Sitting on the mount of anguish,<BR>
At the junction of three rivers,<BR>
Turning rocks of pain and torture,<BR>
Turn away these fell diseases<BR>
Through the virtues of the blue-stone;<BR>
Lead them to the water-channels,<BR>
Sink them in the deeps of ocean,<BR>
Where the winds can never find them,<BR>
Where the sunlight never enters.</P>
<P>"Should this prayer prove unavailing,<BR>
O, Health-virgin, maid of beauty<BR>
Come and heal my dying people,<BR>
Still their agonies and anguish.,<BR>
Give them consciousness and comfort,<BR>
Give them healthful rest and slumber;<BR>
These diseases take and banish,<BR>
Take them in thy copper vessel,<BR>
To thy eaves within the mountains,<BR>
To the summit of the Pain-rock,<BR>
Hurl them to thy boiling caldrons.<BR>
In the mountain is a touch-stone,<BR>
Lucky-stone of ancient story,<BR>
With a hole bored through the centre,<BR>
Through this pour these pains and tortures,<BR>
Wretched feelings, thoughts of evil,<BR>
Human ailments, days unlucky,<BR>
Tribulations, and misfortunes,<BR>
That they may not rise at evening,<BR>
May not see the light of morning."</P>
<P>Ending thus, old Wainamoinen,<BR>
The eternal, wise enchanter,<BR>
Rubbed his sufferers with balsams,<BR>
Rubbed the tissues, red and painful,<BR>
With the balm of healing flowers,<BR>
Balsams made of herbs enchanted,<BR>
Sprinkled all with healing vapors,<BR>
Spake these words in supplication.<BR>
"Ukko, thou who art in heaven,<BR>
God of justice, and of mercy,<BR>
Send us from the east a rain-cloud,<BR>
Send a dark cloud from the North-west,<BR>
From the north let fall a third one,<BR>
Send us mingled rain and honey,<BR>
Balsam from the great Physician,<BR>
To remove this plague of Northland.<BR>
What I know of healing measures,<BR>
Only comes from my Creator;<BR>
Lend me, therefore, of thy wisdom,<BR>
That I may relieve my people,<BR>
Save them from the fell destroyer,<BR>
If my hands should fall in virtue,<BR>
Let the hands of Ukko follow,<BR>
God alone can save from trouble.<BR>
Come to us with thine enchantment,<BR>
Speak the magic words of healing,<BR>
That my people may not perish;<BR>
Give to all alleviation<BR>
From their sicknesses and sorrows;<BR>
In the morning, in the evening,<BR>
Let their wasting ailments vanish;<BR>
Drive the Death-child from Wainola,<BR>
Nevermore to visit Northland,<BR>
Never in the course of ages,<BR>
Never while the moonlight glimmers<BR>
O'er the lakes of Kalevala."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the enchanter,<BR>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<BR>
Thus expelled the nine diseases,<BR>
Evil children or Lowyatar,<BR>
Healed the tribes of Kalevala,<BR>
Saved his people from destruction.</P>
