<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">MARIATTA--WAINAMOINEN'S DEPARTURE.</H1>
<P>MARIATTA, child of beauty,<BR>
Grew to maidenhood in Northland,<BR>
In the cabin of her father,<BR>
In the chambers of her mother,<BR>
Golden ringlets, silver girdles,<BR>
Worn against the keys paternal,<BR>
Glittering upon her bosom;<BR>
Wore away the father's threshold<BR>
With the long robes of her garments;<BR>
Wore away the painted rafters<BR>
With her beauteous silken ribbons;<BR>
Wore away the gilded pillars<BR>
With the touching of her fingers;<BR>
Wore away the birchen flooring<BR>
With the tramping of her fur-shoes.</P>
<P>Mariatta, child of beauty,<BR>
Magic maid of little stature,<BR>
Guarded well her sacred virtue,<BR>
Her sincerity and honor,<BR>
Fed upon the dainty whiting,<BR>
On the inner bark of birch-wood,<BR>
On the tender flesh of lambkins.</P>
<P>When she hastened in the evening<BR>
To her milking in the hurdles,<BR>
Spake in innocence as follows:<BR>
"Never will the snow-white virgin<BR>
Milk the kine of one unworthy!"</P>
<P>When she journeyed over snow-fields,<BR>
On the seat beside her father,<BR>
Spake in purity as follows:<BR>
"Not behind a steed unworthy<BR>
Will I ever ride the snow-sledge!"</P>
<P>Mariatta, child of beauty,<BR>
Lived a virgin with her mother,<BR>
As a maiden highly honored,<BR>
Lived in innocence and beauty,<BR>
Daily drove her flocks to pasture,<BR>
Walking with the gentle lambkins.<BR>
When the lambkins climbed the mountains,<BR>
When they gamboled on the hill-tops,<BR>
Stepped the virgin to the meadow,<BR>
Skipping through a grove of lindens,<BR>
At the calling of the cuckoo,<BR>
To the songster's golden measures.</P>
<P>Mariatta, child of beauty,<BR>
Looked about, intently listened,<BR>
Sat upon the berry-meadow<BR>
Sat awhile, and meditated<BR>
On a hillock by the forest,<BR>
And soliloquized as follows:<BR>
"Call to me, thou golden cuckoo,<BR>
Sing, thou sacred bird of Northland,<BR>
Sing, thou silver breasted songster,<BR>
Speak, thou strawberry of Ehstland,<BR>
Tell bow long must I unmarried,<BR>
As a shepherdess neglected,<BR>
Wander o'er these bills and mountains,<BR>
Through these flowery fens and fallows.<BR>
Tell me, cuckoo of the woodlands,<BR>
Sing to me how many summers<BR>
I must live without a husband,<BR>
As a shepherdess neglected!"</P>
<P>Mariatta, child of beauty,<BR>
Lived a shepherd-maid for ages,<BR>
As a virgin with her mother.<BR>
Wretched are the lives of shepherds,<BR>
Lives of maidens still more wretched,<BR>
Guarding flocks upon the mountains;<BR>
Serpents creep in bog and stubble,<BR>
On the greensward dart the lizards;<BR>
But it was no serpent singing,<BR>
Nor a sacred lizard calling,<BR>
It was but the mountain-berry<BR>
Calling to the lonely maiden:<BR>
"Come, O virgin, come and pluck me,<BR>
Come and take me to thy bosom,<BR>
Take me, tinsel-breasted virgin,<BR>
Take me, maiden, copper-belted,<BR>
Ere the slimy snail devours me,<BR>
Ere the black-worm feeds upon me.<BR>
Hundreds pass my way unmindful,<BR>
Thousands come within my hearing,<BR>
Berry-maidens swarm about me,<BR>
Children come in countless numbers,<BR>
None of these has come to gather,<BR>
Come to pluck this ruddy berry."</P>
<P>Mariatta, child of beauty,<BR>
Listened to its gentle pleading,<BR>
Ran to pick the berry, calling,<BR>
With her fair and dainty fingers,.<BR>
Saw it smiling near the meadow,<BR>
Like a cranberry in feature,<BR>
Like a strawberry in flavor;<BR>
But be Virgin, Mariatta,<BR>
Could not pluck the woodland-stranger,<BR>
Thereupon she cut a charm-stick,<BR>
Downward pressed upon the berry,<BR>
When it rose as if by magic,<BR>
Rose above her shoes of ermine,<BR>
Then above her copper girdle,<BR>
Darted upward to her bosom,<BR>
Leaped upon the maiden's shoulder,<BR>
On her dimpled chin it rested,<BR>
On her lips it perched a moment,<BR>
Hastened to her tongue expectant<BR>
To and fro it rocked and lingered,<BR>
Thence it hastened on its journey,<BR>
Settled in the maiden's bosom.<BR>
Mariatta, child of beauty,<BR>
Thus became a bride impregnate,<BR>
Wedded to the mountain-berry;<BR>
Lingered in her room at morning,<BR>
Sat at midday in the darkness,<BR>
Hastened to her couch at evening.<BR>
Thus the watchful mother wonders:<BR>
"What has happened to our Mary,<BR>
To our virgin, Mariatta,<BR>
That she throws aside her girdle,<BR>
Shyly slips through hall and chamber,<BR>
Lingers in her room at morning,<BR>
Hastens to her couch at evening,<BR>
Sits at midday in the darkness?"</P>
<P>On the floor a babe was playing,<BR>
And the young child thus made answer:<BR>
"This has happened to our Mary,<BR>
To our virgin, Mariatta,<BR>
This misfortune to the maiden:<BR>
She has lingered by the meadows,<BR>
Played too long among the lambkins,<BR>
Tasted of the mountain-berry."</P>
<P>Long the virgin watched and waited,<BR>
Anxiously the days she counted,<BR>
Waiting for the dawn of trouble.<BR>
Finally she asked her mother,<BR>
These the words of Mariatta:<BR>
"Faithful mother, fond and tender,<BR>
Mother whom I love and cherish,<BR>
Make for me a place befitting,<BR>
Where my troubles may be lessened,<BR>
And my heavy burdens lightened."<BR>
This the answer of the mother:<BR>
"Woe to thee, thou Hisi-maiden,<BR>
Since thou art a bride unworthy,<BR>
Wedded only to dishonor!"</P>
<P>Mariatta, child of beauty,<BR>
Thus replied in truthful measures:<BR>
"I am not a maid of Hisi,<BR>
I am not a bride unworthy,<BR>
Am not wedded to dishonor;<BR>
As a shepherdess I wandered<BR>
With the lambkins to the glen-wood,<BR>
Wandered to the berry-mountain,<BR>
Where the strawberry had ripened;<BR>
Quick as thought I plucked the berry,<BR>
On my tongue I gently laid it,<BR>
To and fro it rocked and lingered,<BR>
Settled in my heaving bosom.<BR>
This the source of all my trouble,<BR>
Only cause of my dishonor!"</P>
<P>As the mother was relentless,<BR>
Asked the maiden of her father,<BR>
This the virgin-mother's pleading:<BR>
O my father, full of pity,<BR>
Source of both my good and evil,<BR>
Build for me a place befitting,<BR>
Where my troubles may be lessened,<BR>
And my heavy burdens lightened."<BR>
This the answer of the father,<BR>
Of the father unforgiving:<BR>
"Go, thou evil child of Hisi,<BR>
Go, thou child of sin and sorrow,<BR>
Wedded only to dishonor,<BR>
To the Great Bear's rocky chamber,<BR>
To the stone-cave of the growler,<BR>
There to lessen all thy troubles,<BR>
There to cast thy heavy burdens!"</P>
<P>Mariatta, child of beauty,<BR>
Thus made answer to her father:<BR>
"I am not a child of Hisi,<BR>
I am not a bride unworthy,<BR>
Am not wedded to dishonor;<BR>
I shall bear a noble hero,<BR>
I shall bear a son immortal,<BR>
Who will rule among the mighty,<BR>
Rule the ancient Wainamoinen."</P>
<P>Thereupon the virgin-mother<BR>
Wandered hither, wandered thither,<BR>
Seeking for a place befitting,<BR>
Seeking for a worthy birth-place<BR>
For her unborn son and hero;<BR>
Finally these words she uttered<BR>
"Piltti, thou my youngest maiden,<BR>
Trustiest of all my servants,<BR>
Seek a place within the village,<BR>
Ask it of the brook of Sara,<BR>
For the troubled Mariatta,<BR>
Child of sorrow and misfortune."</P>
<P>Thereupon the little maiden,<BR>
Piltti, spake these words in answer:<BR>
"Whom shall I entreat for succor,<BR>
Who will lend me his assistance?<BR>
These the words of Mariatta:<BR>
"Go and ask it of Ruotus,<BR>
Where the reed-brook pours her waters."</P>
<P>Thereupon the servant, Piltti,<BR>
Ever hopeful, ever willing,<BR>
Hastened to obey her mistress,<BR>
Needing not her exhortation;<BR>
Hastened like the rapid river,<BR>
Like the flying smoke of battle<BR>
To the cabin of Ruotus.<BR>
When she walked the hill-tops tottered,<BR>
When she ran the mountains trembled;<BR>
Shore-reeds danced upon the pasture,<BR>
Sandstones skipped about the heather<BR>
As the maiden, Piltti, hastened<BR>
To the dwelling of Ruotus.</P>
<P>At his table in his cabin<BR>
Sat Ruotus, eating, drinking,<BR>
In his simple coat of linen.<BR>
With his elbows on the table<BR>
Spake the wizard in amazement:<BR>
"Why hast thou, a maid of evil,<BR>
Come to see me in my cavern,<BR>
What the message thou art bringing?<BR>
Thereupon the servant, Piltti,<BR>
Gave this answer to the wizard:<BR>
"Seek I for a spot befitting,<BR>
Seek I for a worthy birth-place,<BR>
For an unborn child and hero;<BR>
Seek it near the Sara-streamlet,<BR>
Where the reed-brook pours her waters.</P>
<P>Came the wife of old Ruotus,<BR>
Walking with her arms akimbo,<BR>
Thus addressed the maiden, Piltti:<BR>
"Who is she that asks assistance,<BR>
Who the maiden thus dishonored,<BR>
What her name, and who her kindred?"</P>
<P>"I have come for Mariatta,<BR>
For the worthy virgin-mother."<BR>
Spake the wife of old Ruotus,<BR>
Evil-minded, cruel-hearted:<BR>
"Occupied are all our chambers,<BR>
All our bath-rooms near the reed-brook;<BR>
in the mount of fire are couches,<BR>
is a stable in the forest,<BR>
For the flaming horse of Hisi;<BR>
In the stable is a manger<BR>
Fitting birth-place for the hero<BR>
From the wife of cold misfortune,<BR>
Worthy couch for Mariatta!"</P>
<P>Thereupon the servant, Piltti,<BR>
Hastened to her anxious mistress,<BR>
Spake these measures, much regretting.<BR>
"There is not a place befitting,<BR>
on the silver brook of Sara.<BR>
Spake the wife of old Ruotus:<BR>
'Occupied are all the chambers,<BR>
All the bath-rooms near the reed-brook;<BR>
In the mount of fire are couches,<BR>
Is a stable, in the forest,<BR>
For the flaming horse of Hisi;<BR>
In the stable is a manger,<BR>
Fitting birth-place for the hero<BR>
From the wife of cold misfortune,<BR>
Worthy couch for Mariatta.'"</P>
<P>Thereupon the hapless maiden,<BR>
Mariatta, virgin-mother,<BR>
Fell to bitter tears and murmurs,<BR>
Spake these words in depths of sorrow:<BR>
"I, alas! must go an outcast,<BR>
Wander as a wretched hireling,<BR>
Like a servant in dishonor,<BR>
Hasten to the burning mountain,<BR>
To the stable in the forest,<BR>
Make my bed within a manger,<BR>
Near the flaming steed of Hisi!"</P>
<P>Quick the hapless virgin-mother,<BR>
Outcast from her father's dwelling,<BR>
Gathered up her flowing raiment,<BR>
Grasped a broom of birchen branches,<BR>
Hastened forth in pain and sorrow<BR>
To the stable in the woodlands,<BR>
On the heights of Tapio's mountains,<BR>
Spake these words in supplication:<BR>
"Come, I pray thee, my Creator,<BR>
Only friend in times of trouble,<BR>
Come to me and bring protection<BR>
To thy child, the virgin-mother,<BR>
To the maiden, Mariatta,<BR>
In this hour of sore affliction.<BR>
Come to me, benignant Ukko,<BR>
Come, thou only hope and refuge,<BR>
Lest thy guiltless child should perish,<BR>
Die the death of the unworthy!"</P>
<P>When the virgin, Mariatta,<BR>
Had arrived within the stable<BR>
Of the flaming horse of Hisi,<BR>
She addressed the steed as follows:<BR>
"Breathe, O sympathizing fire-horse,<BR>
Breathe on me, the virgin-mother,<BR>
Let thy heated breath give moisture,<BR>
Let thy pleasant warmth surround me,<BR>
Like the vapor of the morning;<BR>
Let this pure and helpless maiden<BR>
Find a refuge in thy manger!"</P>
<P>Thereupon the horse, in pity,<BR>
Breathed the moisture of his nostrils<BR>
On the body of the virgin,<BR>
Wrapped her in a cloud of vapor,<BR>
Gave her warmth and needed comforts,<BR>
Gave his aid to the afflicted,<BR>
To the virgin, Mariatta.</P>
<P>There the babe was born and cradled<BR>
Cradled in a woodland-manger,<BR>
Of the virgin, Mariatta,<BR>
Pure as pearly dews of morning,<BR>
Holy as the stars in heaven.<BR>
There the mother rocks her infant,<BR>
In his swaddling clothes she wraps him,<BR>
Lays him in her robes of linen;<BR>
Carefully the babe she nurtures,<BR>
Well she guards her much-beloved,<BR>
Guards her golden child of beauty,<BR>
Her beloved gem of silver.</P>
<P>But alas! the child has vanished,<BR>
Vanished while the mother slumbered.<BR>
Mariatta, lone and wretched,<BR>
Fell to weeping, broken-hearted,<BR>
Hastened off to seek her infant.<BR>
Everywhere the mother sought him,<BR>
Sought her golden child of beauty,<BR>
Her beloved gem of silver;<BR>
Sought him underneath the millstone,<BR>
In the sledge she sought him vainly,<BR>
Underneath the sieve she sought him,<BR>
Underneath the willow-basket,<BR>
Touched the trees, the grass she parted,<BR>
Long she sought her golden infant,<BR>
Sought him on the fir-tree-mountain,<BR>
In the vale, and hill, and heather;<BR>
Looks within the clumps of flowers,<BR>
Well examines every thicket,<BR>
Lifts the juniper and willow,<BR>
Lifts the branches of the alder.</P>
<P>Lo! a star has come to meet her,<BR>
And the star she thus beseeches-.<BR>
"O, thou guiding-star of Northland,<BR>
Star of hope, by God created,<BR>
Dost thou know and wilt thou tell me<BR>
Where my darling child has wandered,<BR>
Where my holy babe lies hidden?"<BR>
Thus the star of Northland answers:<BR>
"If I knew, I would not tell thee;<BR>
'Tis thy child that me created,<BR>
Set me here to watch at evening,<BR>
In the cold to shine forever,<BR>
Here to twinkle in the darkness."</P>
<P>Comes the golden Moon to meet her,<BR>
And the Moon she thus beseeches:<BR>
"Golden Moon, by Ukko fashioned,<BR>
Hope and joy of Kalevala,<BR>
Dost thou know and wilt thou tell me<BR>
Where my darling child has wandered,<BR>
Where my holy babe lies hidden?<BR>
Speaks the golden Moon in answer:<BR>
"If I knew I would not tell thee;<BR>
'Tis thy child that me created,<BR>
Here to wander in the darkness,<BR>
All alone at eve to wander<BR>
On my cold and cheerless journey,<BR>
Sleeping only in the daylight,<BR>
Shining for the good of others."</P>
<P>Thereupon the virgin-mother<BR>
Falls again to bitter weeping,<BR>
Hastens on through fen and forest,<BR>
Seeking for her babe departed.</P>
<P>Comes the silver Sun to meet her,<BR>
And the Sun she thus addresses:<BR>
"Silver Sun by Ukko fashioned,<BR>
Source of light and life to Northland,<BR>
Dost thou know and wilt thou tell me<BR>
Where my darling child has wandered,<BR>
Where my holy babe lies hidden?"<BR>
Wisely does the Sun make answer:<BR>
"Well I know thy babe's dominions,<BR>
Where thy holy child is sleeping,<BR>
Where Wainola's light lies hidden;<BR>
'Tis thy child that me created,<BR>
Made me king of earth and ether,<BR>
Made the Moon and Stars attend me,<BR>
Set me here to shine at midday,<BR>
Makes me shine in silver raiment,<BR>
Lets me sleep and rest at evening;<BR>
Yonder is thy golden infant,<BR>
There thy holy babe lies sleeping,<BR>
Hidden to his belt in water,<BR>
Hidden in the reeds and rushes."</P>
<P>Mariatta, child of beauty,<BR>
Virgin-mother of the Northland,<BR>
Straightway seeks her babe in Swamp-land,<BR>
Finds him in the reeds and rushes;<BR>
Takes the young child on her bosom<BR>
To the dwelling of her father.</P>
<P>There the infant grew in beauty,<BR>
Gathered strength, and light, and wisdom,<BR>
All of Suomi saw and wondered.<BR>
No one knew what name to give him;<BR>
When the mother named him, Flower,<BR>
Others named him, Son-of-Sorrow.</P>
<P>When the virgin, Mariatta,<BR>
Sought the priesthood to baptize him,<BR>
Came an old man, Wirokannas,<BR>
With a cup of holy water,<BR>
Bringing to the babe his blessing;<BR>
And the gray-beard spake as follows:<BR>
"I shall not baptize a wizard,<BR>
Shall not bless a black-magician<BR>
With the drops of holy water;<BR>
Let the young child be examined,<BR>
Let us know that he is worthy,<BR>
Lest he prove the son of witchcraft."</P>
<P>Thereupon old Wirokannas<BR>
Called the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<BR>
To inspect the infant-wonder,<BR>
To report him good or evil.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<BR>
Carefully the child examined,<BR>
Gave this answer to his people:<BR>
"Since the child is but an outcast,<BR>
Born and cradled in a manger,<BR>
Since the berry is his father;<BR>
Let him lie upon the heather,<BR>
Let him sleep among the rushes,<BR>
Let him live upon the mountains;<BR>
Take the young child to the marshes,<BR>
Dash his head against the birch-tree."</P>
<P>Then the child of Mariatta,<BR>
Only two weeks old, made answer:<BR>
"O, thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Son of Folly and Injustice,<BR>
Senseless hero of the Northland,<BR>
Falsely hast thou rendered judgment.<BR>
In thy years, for greater follies,<BR>
Greater sins and misdemeanors,<BR>
Thou wert not unjustly punished.<BR>
In thy former years of trouble,<BR>
When thou gavest thine own brother,<BR>
For thy selfish life a ransom,<BR>
Thus to save thee from destruction,<BR>
Then thou wert not sent to Swamp-land<BR>
To be murdered for thy follies.<BR>
In thy former years of sorrow,<BR>
When the beauteous Aino perished<BR>
In the deep and boundless blue-sea,<BR>
To escape thy persecutions,<BR>
Then thou wert not evil-treated,<BR>
Wert not banished by thy people."</P>
<P>Thereupon old Wirokannas,<BR>
Of the wilderness the ruler,<BR>
Touched the child with holy water,<BR>
Crave the wonder-babe his blessing,<BR>
Gave him rights of royal heirship,<BR>
Free to live and grow a hero,<BR>
To become a mighty ruler,<BR>
King and Master of Karyala.</P>
<P>As the years passed Wainamoinen<BR>
Recognized his waning powers,<BR>
Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,<BR>
Sang his farewell song to Northland,<BR>
To the people of Wainola;<BR>
Sang himself a boat of copper,<BR>
Beautiful his bark of magic;<BR>
At the helm sat the magician,<BR>
Sat the ancient wisdom-singer.<BR>
Westward, westward, sailed the hero<BR>
O'er the blue-back of the waters,<BR>
Singing as he left Wainola,<BR>
This his plaintive song and echo:<BR>
"Suns may rise and set in Suomi,<BR>
Rise and set for generations,<BR>
When the North will learn my teachings,<BR>
Will recall my wisdom-sayings,<BR>
Hungry for the true religion.<BR>
Then will Suomi need my coming,<BR>
Watch for me at dawn of morning,<BR>
That I may bring back the Sampo,<BR>
Bring anew the harp of joyance,<BR>
Bring again the golden moonlight,<BR>
Bring again the silver sunshine,<BR>
Peace and plenty to the Northland."</P>
<P>Thus the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
In his copper-banded vessel,<BR>
Left his tribe in Kalevala,<BR>
Sailing o'er the rolling billows,<BR>
Sailing through the azure vapors,<BR>
Sailing through the dusk of evening,<BR>
Sailing to the fiery sunset,<BR>
To the higher-landed regions,<BR>
To the lower verge of heaven;<BR>
Quickly gained the far horizon,<BR>
Gained the purple-colored harbor.<BR>
There his bark be firmly anchored,<BR>
Rested in his boat of copper;<BR>
But be left his harp of magic,<BR>
Left his songs and wisdom-sayings,<BR>
To the lasting joy of Suomi.</P>
