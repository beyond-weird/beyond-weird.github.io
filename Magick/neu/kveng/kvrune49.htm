<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">RESTORATION OF THE SUN AND MOON.</H1>
<P>THUS has Fire returned to Northland<BR>
But the gold Moon is not shining,<BR>
Neither gleams the silver sunlight<BR>
In the chambers of Wainola,<BR>
On the plains of Kalevala.<BR>
On the crops the white-frost settled,<BR>
And the cattle died of hunger,<BR>
Even birds grew sick and perished.<BR>
Men and maidens, faint and famished,<BR>
Perished in the cold and darkness,<BR>
From the absence of the sunshine,<BR>
From the absence of the moonlight.<BR>
Knew the pike his holes and hollows,<BR>
And the eagle knew his highway,<BR>
Knew the winds the times for sailing;<BR>
But the wise men of the Northland<BR>
Could not know the dawn of morning,<BR>
On the fog-point in the ocean,<BR>
On the islands forest-covered.</P>
<P>Young and aged talked and wondered,<BR>
Well reflected, long debated,<BR>
How to live without the moonlight,<BR>
Live without the silver sunshine,<BR>
In the cold and cheerless Northland,<BR>
In the homes of Kalevala.<BR>
Long conjectured all the maidens,<BR>
Orphans asked the wise for counsel.</P>
<P>Spake a maid to Ilmarinen,<BR>
Running to the blacksmith's furnace:<BR>
"Rise, O artist, from thy slumbers,<BR>
Hasten from thy couch unworthy;<BR>
Forge from gold the Moon for Northland,<BR>
Forge anew the Sun from silver<BR>
Cannot live without the moonlight,<BR>
Nor without the silver sunshine!"</P>
<P>From his couch arose the artist,<BR>
From his couch of stone, the blacksmith,<BR>
And began his work of forging,<BR>
Forging Sun and Moon for Northland.</P>
<P>Came the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
In the doorway sat and lingered,<BR>
Spake, these Words to Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Blacksmith, my beloved brother,<BR>
Thou the only metal-worker,<BR>
Tell me why thy magic hammer<BR>
Falls so heavy on thine anvil?"<BR>
Spake the youthful Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Moon of gold and Sun of silver,<BR>
I am forging for Wainola;<BR>
I shall swing them into ether,<BR>
Plant them in the starry heavens."<BR>
Spake the wise, old Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Senseless blacksmith of the ages,<BR>
Vainly dost thou swing thy hammer,<BR>
Vainly rings thy mighty anvil;<BR>
Silver will not gleam as sunshine,<BR>
Not of gold is born the moonlight!"</P>
<P>Ilmarinen, little heeding,<BR>
Ceases not to ply his hammer,<BR>
Sun and Moon the artist forges,<BR>
Wings the Moon of Magic upward,<BR>
Hurls it to the pine-tree branches;<BR>
Does not shine without her master.<BR>
Then the silver Sun he stations<BR>
In an elm-tree on the mountain.<BR>
From his forehead drip the sweat-drops,<BR>
Perspiration from his fingers,<BR>
Through his labors at the anvil<BR>
While the Sun and Moon were forging;<BR>
But the Sun shone not at morning<BR>
From his station in the elm-tree;<BR>
And the Moon shone not at evening<BR>
From the pine-tree's topmost branches.<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Let the Fates be now consulted,<BR>
And the oracles examined;<BR>
Only thus may we discover<BR>
Where the Sun and Moon lie hidden."</P>
<P>Thereupon old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Only wise and true magician,<BR>
Cut three chips from trunks of alder,<BR>
Laid the chips in magic order,<BR>
Touched and turned them with his fingers,<BR>
Spake these words of master-magic:<BR>
"Of my Maker seek I knowledge,<BR>
Ask in hope and faith the answer<BR>
From the great magician, Ukko:<BR>
Tongue of alder, tell me truly,<BR>
Symbol of the great Creator,<BR>
Where the Sun and Moon are sleeping;<BR>
For the Moon shines not in season,<BR>
Nor appears the Sun at midday,<BR>
From their stations in the sky-vault.<BR>
Speak the truth, O magic alder,<BR>
Speak not words of man, nor hero,<BR>
Hither bring but truthful measures.<BR>
Let us form a sacred compact:<BR>
If thou speakest me a falsehood,<BR>
I will hurl thee to Manala,<BR>
Let the nether fires consume thee,<BR>
That thine evil signs may perish."</P>
<P>Thereupon the alder answered,<BR>
Spake these words of truthful import:</P>
<P>"Verily the Sun lies hidden<BR>
And the golden Moon is sleeping<BR>
In the stone-berg of Pohyola,<BR>
In the copper-bearing mountain."<BR>
These the words of Wainamoinen:<BR>
"I shall go at once to Northland,<BR>
To the cold and dark Pohyola,<BR>
Bring the Sun and Moon to gladden<BR>
All Wainola's fields and forests."</P>
<P>Forth he hastens on his journey,<BR>
To the dismal Sariola,<BR>
To the Northland cold and dreary;<BR>
Travels one day, then a second,<BR>
So the third from morn till evening,<BR>
When appear the gates of Pohya,<BR>
With her snow-clad hills and mountains.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
At the river of Pohyola,<BR>
Loudly calls the ferry-maiden:<BR>
Bring a boat, O Pohya-daughter,<BR>
Bring a strong and trusty vessel,<BR>
Row me o'er these chilling waters,<BR>
O'er this rough and rapid river! "</P>
<P>But the Ferry-maiden heard not,<BR>
Did not listen to his calling.<BR>
Thereupon old Wainamoinen,<BR>
Laid a pile of well-dried brush-wood,<BR>
Knots and needles of the fir-tree,<BR>
Made a fire beside the river,<BR>
Sent the black smoke into heaven<BR>
Curling to the home of Ukko.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<BR>
Hastened to her chamber window,<BR>
Looked upon the bay and river,<BR>
Spake these words to her attendants:<BR>
"Why the fire across the river<BR>
Where the current meets the deep-sea,<BR>
Smaller than the fires of foemen,<BR>
Larger than the flames of hunters?"</P>
<P>Thereupon a Pohyalander<BR>
Hastened from the court of Louhi<BR>
That the cause he might discover,'<BR>
Bring the sought-for information<BR>
To the hostess of Pohyola;<BR>
Saw upon the river-border<BR>
Some great hero from Wainola.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen saw the stranger,<BR>
Called again in tones of thunder:<BR>
"Bring a skiff; thou son of Northland,<BR>
For the minstrel, Wainamoinen!<BR>
Thus the Pohyalander answered:<BR>
"Here no skiffs are lying idle,<BR>
Row thyself across the waters,<BR>
Use thine arms, and feet, and fingers,<BR>
To propel thee o'er the river,<BR>
O'er the sacred stream of Pohya."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, long reflecting,<BR>
Bravely thus soliloquizes:<BR>
"I will change my form and features,<BR>
Will assume a second body,<BR>
Neither man, nor ancient minstrel,<BR>
Master of the Northland waters!"</P>
<P>Then the singer, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Leaped, a pike, upon the waters,<BR>
Quickly swam the rapid river,<BR>
Gained the frigid Pohya-border.<BR>
There his native form resuming,<BR>
Walked he as a mighty hero,<BR>
On the dismal isle of Louhi,<BR>
Spake the wicked sons of Northland:<BR>
Come thou to Pohyola's court-room."</P>
<P>To Pohyola's, court he hastened.<BR>
Spake again the sons of evil:<BR>
Come thou to the halls of Louhi!"</P>
<P>To Pohyola's halls he hastened.<BR>
On the latch he laid his fingers,<BR>
Set his foot within the fore-hall,<BR>
Hastened to the inner chamber,<BR>
Underneath the painted rafters,<BR>
Where the Northland-heroes gather.<BR>
There he found the Pohya-masters<BR>
Girded with their swords of battle,<BR>
With their spears and battle-axes,<BR>
With their fatal bows and arrows,<BR>
For the death of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Ancient bard, Suwantolainen.<BR>
Thus they asked the hero-stranger.<BR>
"Magic swimmer of the Northland,<BR>
Son of evil, what the message<BR>
That thou bringest from thy people,<BR>
What thy mission to Pohyola?"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<BR>
Thus addressed the hosts of Louhi:<BR>
"For the Sun I come to Northland,<BR>
Come to seek the Moon in Pohya;<BR>
Tell me where the Sun lies hidden,<BR>
Where the golden Moon is sleeping."<BR>
Spake the evil sons of Pohya:<BR>
"Both the Sun and Moon are hidden<BR>
In the rock of many colors,<BR>
In the copper-bearing mountain,<BR>
In a cavern iron-banded,<BR>
In the stone-berg of Pohyola,<BR>
Nevermore to gain their freedom,<BR>
Nevermore to shine in Northland!"<BR>
Spake the hero, Wainamoinen:<BR>
"If the Sun be not uncovered,<BR>
If the Moon leave not her dungeon,<BR>
I will challenge all Pohyola<BR>
To the test of spear or broadsword,<BR>
Let us now our weapons measure!"</P>
<P>Quick the hero of Wainola<BR>
Drew his mighty sword of magic;<BR>
On its border shone the moonlight,<BR>
On its hilt the Sun was shining,<BR>
On its back, a neighing stallion,<BR>
On its face a cat was mewing,<BR>
Beautiful his magic weapon.<BR>
Quick the hero-swords are tested,<BR>
And the blades are rightly measured<BR>
Wainamoinen's sword is longest<BR>
By a single grain of barley,<BR>
By a blade of straw, the widest.</P>
<P>To the court-yard rushed the heroes,<BR>
Hastened to the deadly combat,<BR>
On the plains of Sariola.<BR>
Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
Strikes one blow, and then a second,<BR>
Strikes a third time, cuts and conquers.<BR>
As the house-maids slice the turnips,<BR>
As they lop the heads of cabbage,<BR>
As the stalks of flax are broken,<BR>
So the heads of Louhi's heroes<BR>
Fall before the magic broadsword<BR>
Of the ancient Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>Then victor from Wainola,<BR>
Ancient bard and great magician,<BR>
Went to find the Sun in slumber,<BR>
And the golden Moon discover,<BR>
In, the copper-bearing Mountains,<BR>
In the cavern iron-banded,<BR>
In the stone-berg of Pohyola.</P>
<P>He had gone but little distance,<BR>
When he found a sea-green island;<BR>
On the island stood a birch-tree,<BR>
Near the birch-tree stood a pillar<BR>
Carved in stone of many colors;<BR>
In the pillar, nine large portals<BR>
Bolted in a hundred places;<BR>
In the rock he found a crevice<BR>
Sending forth a gleam of sunlight.<BR>
Quick he drew his mighty broadsword,<BR>
From the pillar struck three colors,<BR>
From the magic of his weapon;<BR>
And the pillar fell asunder,<BR>
Three the number of the fragments.<BR>
Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<BR>
Through the crevice looked and wondered.<BR>
In the center of the pillar,<BR>
From a scarlet-colored basin,<BR>
Noxious serpents beer were drinking,<BR>
And the adders eating spices.<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Therefore has Pohyola's hostess<BR>
Little drink to give to strangers,<BR>
Since her beer is drank by serpents,<BR>
And her spices given to adders."</P>
<P>Quick he draws his magic fire-blade,<BR>
Cuts the vipers green in pieces,<BR>
Lops the heads off all the adders,<BR>
Speaks these words of master-magic:<BR>
Thus, hereafter, let the serpent<BR>
Drink the famous beer of barley,<BR>
Feed upon the Northland-spices!"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
The eternal wizard-singer,<BR>
Sought to open wide the portals<BR>
With the hands and words of magic;<BR>
But his hands had lost their cunning,<BR>
And his magic gone to others.</P>
<P>Thereupon the ancient minstrel<BR>
Quick returning, heavy-hearted,<BR>
To his native halls and hamlets,<BR>
Thus addressed his brother-heroes:<BR>
"Woman, he without his weapons,<BR>
With no implements, a weakling!<BR>
Sun and Moon have I discovered,<BR>
But I could not force the Portals<BR>
Leading to their rocky cavern <BR>
In the copper bearing mountain.<BR>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen<BR>
"O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Why was I not taken with thee<BR>
To become, thy war-companion?<BR>
Would have been of goodly service,<BR>
Would have drawn the bolts or broken,<BR>
All the portals to the cavern,<BR>
Where the Sun and Moon lie hidden<BR>
In the copper-bearing mountain!"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Thus replied to Lemminkainen:<BR>
"Empty Words will break no portals,<BR>
Draw no bolts of any moment;<BR>
Locks and bolts are never broken.<BR>
With the words of little wisdom!<BR>
Greater means than thou commandest<BR>
Must be used to free the sunshine,<BR>
Free the moonlight from her dungeon."</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, not discouraged,<BR>
Hastened to the, forge and smithy,<BR>
Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<BR>
"O thou famous metal-artist,<BR>
Forge for me a magic trident,<BR>
Forge from steel a dozen stout-rings,<BR>
Master-keys, a goodly number,<BR>
Iron bars and heavy hammers,<BR>
That the Sun we may uncover<BR>
In the copper-bearing mountain,<BR>
In the stone-berg of Pohyola."</P>
<P>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
The eternal metal-worker,<BR>
Forged the needs of Wainamoinen,<BR>
Forged for him the magic trident,<BR>
Forged from steel a dozen stout-rings,<BR>
Master-keys a goodly number,<BR>
Iron bars and heavy hammers,<BR>
Not the largest, nor the smallest,<BR>
Forged them of the right dimensions.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Northland's old and toothless wizard,<BR>
Fastened wings upon her shoulders,<BR>
As an eagle, sailed the heavens,<BR>
Over field, and fen, and forest,<BR>
Over Pohya's many, waters,<BR>
To the hamlets of Wainola,<BR>
To the forge of Ilmarinen.</P>
<P>Quick the famous metal-worker<BR>
Went to see if winds were blowing;<BR>
Found the winds at peace and silent,<BR>
Found an eagle, sable-colored,<BR>
Perched upon his window-casement.<BR>
Spake the artist, Ilmarinen:<BR>
"Magic bird, whom art thou seeking,<BR>
Why art sitting at my window?"<BR>
This the answer of the eagle:<BR>
"Art thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
The eternal iron-forger,<BR>
Master of the magic metals,<BR>
Northland's wonder-working artist?"<BR>
Ilmarinen gave this answer:<BR>
"There is nothing here of wonder,<BR>
Since I forged the dome of heaven,<BR>
Forged the earth a concave cover!"<BR>
Spake again the magic eagle:<BR>
Why this ringing of thine anvil,<BR>
Why this knocking of thy hammer,<BR>
Tell me what thy hands are forging?"<BR>
This the answer of the blacksmith:<BR>
"'Tis a collar I am forging<BR>
For the neck of wicked Louhi,<BR>
Toothless witch of Sariola,<BR>
Stealer of the silver sunshine,<BR>
Stealer of the golden moonlight;<BR>
With this collar I shall bind her<BR>
To the iron-rock of Ehstland!"</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Saw misfortune fast approaching,<BR>
Saw destruction flying over,<BR>
Saw the signs of bad-luck lower;<BR>
Quickly winged her way through ether<BR>
To her native halls and chambers,<BR>
To the darksome Sariola,<BR>
There unlocked the massive portals<BR>
Where the Sun and Moon were hidden,<BR>
In the rock of many colors,<BR>
In the cavern iron-banded,<BR>
In the copper-bearing mountain.</P>
<P>Then again the wicked Louhi<BR>
Changed her withered form and features,<BR>
And became a dove of good-luck;<BR>
Straightway winged the starry heavens,<BR>
Over field, and fen, and forest,<BR>
To the meadows of Wainola,<BR>
To the plains of Kalevala,<BR>
To the forge of Ilmarinen.<BR>
This the question of the blacksmith<BR>
"Wherefore comest, dove of good-luck,<BR>
What the tidings that thou bringest?"<BR>
Thus the magic bird made answer:<BR>
"Wherefore come I to thy smithy?<BR>
Come to bring the joyful tidings<BR>
That the Sun has left his cavern,<BR>
Left the rock of many colors,<BR>
Left the stone-berg of Pohyola;<BR>
That the Moon no more is hidden<BR>
In the copper-bearing mountains,<BR>
In the caverns iron-banded."</P>
<P>Straightway hastened Ilmarinen<BR>
To the threshold of his smithy,<BR>
Quickly scanned the far horizon,<BR>
Saw again the silver sunshine,<BR>
Saw once more the golden moonlight,<BR>
Bringing peace, and joy, and plenty,<BR>
To the homes of Kalevala.<BR>
Thereupon the blacksmith hastened<BR>
To his brother, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Spake these words to the magician:<BR>
"O thou ancient bard and minstrel,<BR>
The eternal wizard-singer<BR>
See, the Sun again is shining,<BR>
And the golden Moon is beaming<BR>
From their long-neglected places,<BR>
From their stations in the sky-vault!"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<BR>
Straightway hastened to the court-yard,<BR>
Looked upon the far horizon,<BR>
Saw once more the silver sunshine,<BR>
Saw again the golden moonlight,<BR>
Bringing peace, and joy, and plenty,<BR>
To the people of the Northland,<BR>
And the minstrel spake these measures:<BR>
"Greetings to thee, Sun of fortune,<BR>
Greetings to thee, Moon of good-luck,<BR>
Welcome sunshine, welcome moonlight,<BR>
Golden is the dawn of morning!<BR>
Free art thou, O Sun of silver,<BR>
Free again, O Moon beloved,<BR>
As the sacred cuckoo's singing,<BR>
As the ring-dove's liquid cooings.</P>
<P>"Rise, thou silver Sun, each Morning,<BR>
Source of light and life hereafter,<BR>
Bring us, daily, joyful greetings,<BR>
Fill our homes with peace and plenty,<BR>
That our sowing, fishing, hunting,<BR>
May be prospered by thy coming.<BR>
Travel on thy daily journey,<BR>
Let the Moon be ever with thee;<BR>
Glide along thy way rejoicing,<BR>
End thy journeyings in slumber;<BR>
Rest at evening in the ocean,<BR>
When the daily cares have ended,<BR>
To the good of all thy people,<BR>
To the pleasure Of Wainoloa,<BR>
To the joy of Kalevala!"</P>
