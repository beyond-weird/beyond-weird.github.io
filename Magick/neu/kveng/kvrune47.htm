<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">LOUHI STEALS SUN, MOON, AND FIRE.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Touched again his magic harp-strings,<BR>
Sang in miracles of concord,<BR>
Filled the north with joy and gladness.<BR>
Melodies arose to heaven,<BR>
Songs arose to Luna's chambers,<BR>
Echoed through the Sun's bright windows<BR>
And the Moon has left her station,<BR>
Drops and settles in the birch-tree;<BR>
And the Sun comes from his castle,<BR>
Settles in the fir-tree branches,<BR>
Comes to share the common pleasure,<BR>
Comes to listen to the singing,<BR>
To the harp of Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<BR>
Northland's old and toothless wizard,<BR>
Makes the Sun and Moon her captives;<BR>
In her arms she takes fair Luna<BR>
From her cradle in the birch-tree,<BR>
Calls the Sun down from his station,<BR>
From the fir-tree's bending branches,<BR>
Carries them to upper Northland,<BR>
To the darksome Sariola;<BR>
Hides the Moon, no more to glimmer,<BR>
In a rock of many colors;<BR>
Hides the Sun, to shine no longer,<BR>
In the iron-banded mountain;<BR>
Thereupon these words she utters:<BR>
"Moon of gold and Sun of silver,<BR>
Hide your faces in the caverns<BR>
Of Pohyola's dismal mountain;<BR>
Shine no more to gladden Northland,<BR>
Till I come to give ye freedom,<BR>
Drawn by coursers nine in number,<BR>
Sable coursers of one mother!"</P>
<P>When the golden Moon had vanished,<BR>
And the silver Sun had hidden<BR>
In the iron-banded caverns,<BR>
Louhi stole the fire from Northland,<BR>
From the regions of Wainola,<BR>
Left the mansions cold and cheerless,<BR>
And the cabins full of darkness.<BR>
Night was king and reigned unbroken,<BR>
Darkness ruled in Kalevala,<BR>
Darkness in the home of Ukko.<BR>
Hard to live without the moonlight,<BR>
Harder still without the sunshine;<BR>
Ukko's life is dark and dismal,<BR>
When the Sun and Moon desert him.</P>
<P>Ukko, first of all creators,<BR>
Lived in wonder at the darkness;<BR>
Long reflected, well considered,<BR>
Why this miracle in heaven,<BR>
What this accident in nature<BR>
To the Moon upon her journey;<BR>
Why the Sun no more is shining,<BR>
Why has disappeared the moonlight.<BR>
Then great Ukko walked the heavens,<BR>
To the border of the cloudlets,<BR>
In his purple-colored vestments,<BR>
In his silver-tinselled sandals,<BR>
Seeking for the golden moonlight,<BR>
Looking for the silver sunshine.<BR>
Lightning Ukko struck in darkness<BR>
From the edges of his fire-sword;<BR>
Shot the flames in all directions,<BR>
From his blade of golden color,<BR>
Into heaven's upper spaces,<BR>
Into Ether's starry pastures.</P>
<P>When a little fire had kindled,<BR>
Ukko hid it in the cloud-space,<BR>
In a box of gold and silver,<BR>
In a case adorned with silver,<BR>
Gave it to the ether-maidens,<BR>
Called a virgin then to rock it,<BR>
That it might become a new-moon,<BR>
That a second sun might follow.<BR>
On the long-cloud rocked the virgin,<BR>
On the blue-edge of the ether,<BR>
Rocked the fire of the Creator,<BR>
In her copper-colored cradle,<BR>
With her ribbons silver-studded.<BR>
Lowly bend the bands of silver,<BR>
Loud the golden cradle echoes,<BR>
And the clouds of Northland thunder,<BR>
Low descends the dome of heaven,<BR>
At the rocking of the lightning,<BR>
Rocking of the fire of Ukko.<BR>
Thus the flame was gently cradled<BR>
By the virgin of the ether.<BR>
Long the fair and faithful maiden<BR>
Stroked the Fire-child with her fingers,<BR>
Tended it with care and pleasure,<BR>
Till in an unguarded moment<BR>
It escaped the Ether-virgin,<BR>
Slipped the hands of her that nursed it.<BR>
Quick the heavens are burst asunder,<BR>
Quick the vault of Ukko opens,<BR>
Downward drops the wayward Fire-child,<BR>
Downward quick the red-ball rushes,<BR>
Shoots across the arch of heaven,<BR>
Hisses through the startled cloudlets,<BR>
Flashes through the troubled welkin,<BR>
Through nine starry vaults of ether.</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Spake and these the words he uttered:<BR>
"Blacksmith brother, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Let us haste and look together,<BR>
What the kind of fire that falleth,<BR>
What the form of light that shineth<BR>
From the upper vault of heaven,<BR>
From the lower earth and ocean.<BR>
Has a second moon arisen,<BR>
Can it be a ball of sunlight?</P>
<P>Thereupon the heroes wandered,<BR>
Onward journeyed and reflected,<BR>
How to gain the spot illumined,<BR>
How to find the sacred Fire-child.<BR>
Came a river rushing by them,<BR>
Broad and stately as an ocean.<BR>
Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
There began to build a vessel,<BR>
Build a boat to cross the river.<BR>
With the aid of Ilmarinen,<BR>
From the oak he cut the row-locks,<BR>
From the pine the oars be fashioned,<BR>
From the aspen shapes the rudder.<BR>
When the vessel they had finished,<BR>
Quick they rolled it to the current,<BR>
Hard they rowed and ever forward,<BR>
On the Nawa-stream and waters,<BR>
At the head of Nawa-river.</P>
<P>Ilmatar, the ether-daughter,<BR>
Foremost daughter of creation,<BR>
Came to meet them on their journey,<BR>
Thus addressed the coming strangers:<BR>
"Who are ye of Northland heroes,<BR>
Rowing on the Nawa-waters?"<BR>
Wainamoinen gave this answer:<BR>
"This the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
I the ancient Wainamoinen.<BR>
Tell us now thy name and station,<BR>
Whither going, whence thou comest,<BR>
Where thy tribe-folk live and linger?<BR>
Spake the daughter of the Ether:<BR>
"I the oldest of the women,<BR>
Am the first of Ether's daughters,<BR>
Am the first of ancient mothers;<BR>
Seven times have I been wedded.<BR>
To the heroes of creation.<BR>
Whither do ye strangers journey?<BR>
Answered thus old Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Fire has left Wainola's hearth-stones,<BR>
Light has disappeared from Northland;<BR>
Have been sitting long in darkness,<BR>
Cold and darkness our companions;<BR>
Now we journey to discover<BR>
What the fire that fell from heaven,<BR>
Falling from the cloud's red lining,<BR>
To the deeps of earth and ocean."<BR>
Ilmatar returned this answer:<BR>
"Hard the flame is to discover,<BR>
Hard indeed to find the Fire-child;<BR>
Has committed many mischiefs,<BR>
Nothing good has he accomplished;<BR>
Quick the fire-ball fell from ether,<BR>
From the red rims of the cloudlets,<BR>
From the plains of the Creator,<BR>
Through the ever-moving heavens,<BR>
Through the purple ether-spaces,<BR>
Through the blackened flues of Turi,<BR>
To Palwoinen's rooms uncovered.<BR>
When the fire had reached the chambers<BR>
Of Palwoinen, son of evil,<BR>
He began his wicked workings,<BR>
He engaged in lawless actions,<BR>
Raged against the blushing maidens,<BR>
Fired the youth to evil conduct,<BR>
Singed the beards of men and heroes.</P>
<P>"Where the mother nursed her baby,<BR>
In the cold and cheerless cradle,<BR>
Thither flew the wicked Fire-child,<BR>
There to perpetrate some mischief;<BR>
In the cradle burned the infant,<BR>
By the infant burned the mother,<BR>
That the babe might visit Mana,<BR>
In the kingdom of Tuoni;<BR>
Said the child was born for dying,<BR>
Only destined for destruction,<BR>
Through the tortures of the Fire-child.<BR>
Greater knowledge had the mother,<BR>
Did not journey to Manala,<BR>
Knew the word to check the red-flame,<BR>
How to banish the intruder<BR>
Through the eyelet of a needle,<BR>
Through the death-hole of the hatchet."</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Questioned Ilmatar as follows:<BR>
"Whither did the Fire-child wander,<BR>
Whither did the red-flame hasten,<BR>
From the border-fields of Turi,<BR>
To the woods, or to the waters?<BR>
Straightway Ilmatar thus answers:<BR>
"When the fire had fled from Turi,<BR>
From the castles of Palwoinen,<BR>
Through the eyelet of the needle,<BR>
Through the death-hole of the hatchet,<BR>
First it burned the fields, and forests,<BR>
Burned the lowlands, and the heather;<BR>
Then it sought the mighty waters,<BR>
Sought the Alue-sea and river,<BR>
And the waters hissed and sputtered<BR>
In their anger at the Fire-child,<BR>
Fiery red the boiling Alue!</P>
<P>"Three times in the nights of, summer,<BR>
Nine times in the nights of autumn,<BR>
Boil the waters to the tree-tops,<BR>
Roll and tumble to the mountain,<BR>
Through the red-ball's force and fury;<BR>
Hurls the pike upon the pastures,<BR>
To the mountain-cliffs, the salmon,<BR>
Where the ocean-dwellers wonder,<BR>
Long reflect and well consider<BR>
How to still the angry waters.<BR>
Wept the salmon for his grotto,<BR>
Mourned the whiting for his cavern,<BR>
And the lake-trout for his dwelling,<BR>
Quick the crook-necked salmon darted,<BR>
Tried to catch the fire-intruder,<BR>
But the red-ball quick escaped him;<BR>
Darted then the daring whiting,<BR>
Swallowed quick the wicked Fire-child,<BR>
Swallowed quick the flame of evil.<BR>
Quiet grow the Alue-waters,<BR>
Slowly settle to their shore-lines,<BR>
To their long-accustomed places,<BR>
In the long and dismal evening.</P>
<P>"Time had gone but little distance,<BR>
When the whiting grow affrighted,<BR>
Fear befel the fire-devourer;<BR>
Burning pain and writhing tortures<BR>
Seized the eater of the Fire-child;<BR>
Swam the fish in all directions,<BR>
Called, and moaned, and swam, and circled,<BR>
Swam one day, and then a second,<BR>
Swam the third from morn till even;<BR>
Swam she to the whiting-island,<BR>
To the caverns of the salmon,<BR>
Where a hundred islands cluster;<BR>
And the islands there assembled<BR>
Thus addressed the fire-devourer:<BR>
'There is none within these waters,<BR>
In this narrow Alue-lakelet,<BR>
That will eat the fated Fire-fish<BR>
That will swallow thee in trouble,<BR>
In thine agonies and torture<BR>
From the Fire-child thou hast eaten.'</P>
<P>"Hearing this a trout forth darting,<BR>
Swallowed quick as light the whiting,<BR>
Quickly ate the fire-devourer.<BR>
Time had gone but little distance,<BR>
When the trout became affrighted,<BR>
Fear befel the whiting-eater;<BR>
Burning pain and writhing torment<BR>
Seized the eater of the Fire-fish.<BR>
Swam the trout in all directions,<BR>
Called, and moaned, and swam, and circled,<BR>
Swam one day, and then a second,<BR>
Swain the third from morn till even;<BR>
Swam she to the salmon-island,<BR>
Swam she to the whiting-grottoes,<BR>
Where a thousand islands cluster,<BR>
And the islands there assembled<BR>
Thus addressed the tortured lake-trout:<BR>
'There is none within this river,<BR>
In these narrow Alue-waters,<BR>
That will eat the wicked Fire-fish,<BR>
That will swallow thee in trouble,<BR>
In thine agonies and tortures,<BR>
From the Fire-fish thou hast eaten."</P>
<P>Hearing this the gray-pike darted,<BR>
Swallowed quick as light the lake-trout,<BR>
Quickly ate the tortured Fire-fish.</P>
<P>"Time had gone but little distance,<BR>
When the gray-pike grew affrighted,<BR>
Fear befel the lake-trout-eater;<BR>
Burning pain and writhing torment<BR>
Seized the reckless trout-devourer;<BR>
Swam the pike in all directions,<BR>
Called, and moaned, and swam, and circled,<BR>
Swam one day, and then a second,<BR>
Swam the third from morn till even,<BR>
To the cave of ocean-swallows,<BR>
To the sand-hills of the sea-gull,<BR>
Where a hundred islands cluster;<BR>
And the islands there assembled<BR>
Thus addressed the fire-devourer:<BR>
'There is none within this lakelet,<BR>
In these narrow Alue-waters,<BR>
That will eat the fated Fire-fish,<BR>
That will swallow thee in trouble,<BR>
In thine agonies and tortures,<BR>
From the Fire-fish thou hast eaten.'"</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,<BR>
With the aid of Ilmarinen,<BR>
Weaves with skill a mighty fish-net<BR>
From the juniper and sea-grass;<BR>
Dyes the net with alder-water,<BR>
Ties it well with thongs of willow.<BR>
Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Called the maidens to the fish-net,<BR>
And the sisters came as bidden.<BR>
With the netting rowed they onward,<BR>
Rowed they to the hundred islands,<BR>
To the grottoes of the salmon,<BR>
To the caverns of the whiting,<BR>
To the reeds of sable color,<BR>
Where the gray-pike rests and watches.<BR>
On they hasten to the fishing,<BR>
Drag the net in all directions,<BR>
Drag it lengthwise, sidewise, crosswise,<BR>
And diagonally zigzag;<BR>
But they did not catch the Fire-fish.</P>
<P>Then the brothers went a-fishing,<BR>
Dragged the net in all directions,<BR>
Backwards, forwards, lengthwise, sidewise,<BR>
Through the homes of ocean-dwellers,<BR>
Through the grottoes of the salmon,<BR>
Through the dwellings of the whiting,<BR>
Through the reed-beds of the lake-trout,<BR>
Where the gray-pike lies in ambush;<BR>
But the fated Fire-fish came not,<BR>
Came not from the lake's abysses,<BR>
Came not from the Alue-waters.</P>
<P>Little fish could not be captured<BR>
In the large nets of the masters;<BR>
Murmured then the deep-sea-dwellers,<BR>
Spake the salmon to the lake-trout,<BR>
And the lake-trout to the whiting,<BR>
And the whiting to the gray-pike:<BR>
Have the heroes of Wainola<BR>
Died, or have they all departed<BR>
From these fertile shores and waters?<BR>
Where then are the ancient weavers,<BR>
Weavers of the nets of flax-thread,<BR>
Those that frighten us with fish-poles,<BR>
Drag us from our homes unwilling?"</P>
<P>Hearing this wise Wainamoinen<BR>
Answered thus the deep-sea-dwellers:<BR>
"Neither have Wainola's heroes<BR>
Died, nor have they all departed<BR>
From these fertile shores and waters,<BR>
Two are born where one has perished;<BR>
Longer poles and finer fish-nets<BR>
Have the sons of Kalevala!"</P>
