<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">BIRTH OF THE SECOND HARP.</H1>
<P>WAINAMOINEN, ancient minstrel,<BR>
Long reflecting, sang these measures:<BR>
"It is now the time befitting<BR>
To awaken joy and gladness,<BR>
Time for me to touch the harp-strings,<BR>
Time to sing the songs primeval,<BR>
In these spacious halls and mansions,<BR>
In these homes of Kalevala;<BR>
But, alas! my harp lies hidden,<BR>
Sunk upon the deep-sea's bottom,<BR>
To the salmon's hiding-places,<BR>
To the dwellings of the whiting,<BR>
To the people of Wellamo,<BR>
Where the Northland-pike assemble.<BR>
Nevermore will I regain it,<BR>
Ahto never will return it,<BR>
Joy and music gone forever!</P>
<P>"O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<BR>
Forge for me a rake of iron,<BR>
Thickly set the teeth of copper,<BR>
Many fathoms long the handle;<BR>
Make a rake to search the waters,<BR>
Search the broad-sea to the bottom,<BR>
Rake the weeds and reeds together,<BR>
Rake them to the curving sea-shore,<BR>
That I may regain my treasure,<BR>
May regain my harp of fish-bow<BR>
From the whiting's place of resting,<BR>
From the caverns of the salmon,<BR>
From the castles of Wellamo."</P>
<P>Thereupon young Ilmarinen,<BR>
The eternal metal-worker,<BR>
Forges well a rake of iron,<BR>
Teeth in length a hundred fathoms,<BR>
And a thousand long the handle,<BR>
Thickly sets the teeth of copper.<BR>
Straightway ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Takes the rake of magic metals,<BR>
Travels but a little distance,<BR>
To the cylinders of oak-wood,<BR>
To the copper-banded rollers,<BR>
Where be finds two ships awaiting,<BR>
One was new, the other ancient.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,<BR>
Thus addressed the new-made vessel:<BR>
"Go, thou boat of master-magic,<BR>
Hasten to the willing waters,<BR>
Speed away upon the blue-sea,<BR>
And without the hand to move thee;<BR>
Let my will impel thee seaward."</P>
<P>Quick the boat rolled to the billows<BR>
On the cylinders of oak-wood,<BR>
Quick descended to the waters,<BR>
Willingly obeyed his master.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, the magician,<BR>
Then began to rake the sea-beds,<BR>
Raked up all the water-flowers,<BR>
Bits of broken reeds and rushes,<BR>
Deep-sea shells and colored pebbles,<BR>
Did not find his harp of fish-bone,<BR>
Lost forever to Wainola!</P>
<P>Thereupon the ancient minstrel<BR>
Left the waters, homeward hastened,<BR>
Cap pulled clown upon his forehead,<BR>
Sang this song with sorrow laden:<BR>
"Nevermore shall I awaken<BR>
With my harp-strings, joy and gladness!<BR>
Nevermore will Wainamoinen<BR>
Charm the people of the Northland<BR>
With the harp of his creation!<BR>
Nevermore my songs will echo<BR>
O'er the hills of Kalevala!"</P>
<P>Thereupon the ancient singer<BR>
Went lamenting through the forest,<BR>
Wandered through the sighing pine-woods,<BR>
Heard the wailing of a birch-tree,<BR>
Heard a juniper complaining;<BR>
Drawing nearer, waits and listens,<BR>
Thus the birch-tree he addresses:<BR>
"Wherefore, brother, art thou weeping,<BR>
Merry birch enrobed in silver,<BR>
Silver-leaved and silver-tasselled?<BR>
Art thou shedding tears of sorrow,<BR>
Since thou art not led to battle,<BR>
Not enforced to war with wizards?<BR>
Wisely does the birch make answer:<BR>
"This the language of the many,<BR>
Others speak as thou, unjustly,<BR>
That I only live in pleasure,<BR>
That my silver leaves and tassels<BR>
Only whisper my rejoicings;<BR>
That I have no cares, no sorrows,<BR>
That I have no hours unhappy,<BR>
Knowing neither pain nor trouble.<BR>
I am weeping for my smallness,<BR>
Am lamenting for my weakness,<BR>
Have no sympathy, no pity,<BR>
Stand here motionless for ages,<BR>
Stand alone in fen and forest,<BR>
In these woodlands vast and joyless.<BR>
Others hope for coming summers,<BR>
For the beauties of the spring-time;<BR>
I, alas! a helpless birch-tree,<BR>
Dread the changing of the seasons,<BR>
I must give my bark to, others,<BR>
Lose my leaves and silken tassels.<BR>
Men come the Suomi children,<BR>
Peel my bark and drink my life-blood:<BR>
Wicked shepherds in the summer,<BR>
Come and steal my belt of silver,<BR>
Of my bark make berry-baskets,<BR>
Dishes make, and cups for drinking.<BR>
Oftentimes the Northland maidens<BR>
Cut my tender limbs for birch-brooms,'<BR>
Bind my twigs and silver tassels<BR>
Into brooms to sweep their cabins;<BR>
Often have the Northland heroes<BR>
Chopped me into chips for burning;<BR>
Three times in the summer season,<BR>
In the pleasant days of spring-time,<BR>
Foresters have ground their axes<BR>
On my silver trunk and branches,<BR>
Robbed me of my life for ages;<BR>
This my spring-time joy and pleasure,<BR>
This my happiness in summer,<BR>
And my winter days no better!<BR>
When I think of former troubles,<BR>
Sorrow settles on my visage,<BR>
And my face grows white with anguish;<BR>
Often do the winds of winter<BR>
And the hoar-frost bring me sadness,<BR>
Blast my tender leaves and tassels,<BR>
Bear my foliage to others,<BR>
Rob me of my silver raiment,<BR>
Leave me naked on the mountain,<BR>
Lone, and helpless, and disheartened!"<BR>
Spake the good, old Wainamoinen:<BR>
"Weep no longer, sacred birch-tree,<BR>
Mourn no more, my friend and brother,<BR>
Thou shalt have a better fortune;<BR>
I will turn thy grief to joyance,<BR>
Make thee laugh and sing with gladness."</P>
<P>Then the ancient Wainamoinen<BR>
Made a harp from sacred birch-wood,<BR>
Fashioned in the days of summer,<BR>
Beautiful the harp of magic,<BR>
By the master's hand created<BR>
On the fog-point in the Big-Sea,<BR>
On the island forest-covered,<BR>
Fashioned from the birch the archings,<BR>
And the frame-work from the aspen.<BR>
These the words of the magician:<BR>
"All the archings are completed,<BR>
And the frame is fitly finished;<BR>
Whence the hooks and pins for tuning,<BR>
That the harp may sing in concord?"</P>
<P>Near the way-side grew an oak-tree,<BR>
Skyward grew with equal branches,<BR>
On each twig an acorn growing,<BR>
Golden balls upon each acorn,<BR>
On each ball a singing cuckoo.<BR>
As each cuckoo's call resounded,<BR>
Five the notes of song that issued<BR>
From the songster's throat of joyance;<BR>
From each throat came liquid music,<BR>
Gold and silver for the master,<BR>
Flowing to the hills and hillocks,<BR>
To the silvery vales and mountains;<BR>
Thence he took the merry harp-pins,<BR>
That the harp might play in concord.<BR>
Spake again wise Wainamoinen:<BR>
"I the pins have well completed,<BR>
Still the harp is yet unfinished;<BR>
Now I need five strings for playing,<BR>
Where shall I procure the harp-strings?"<BR>
Then the ancient bard and minstrel<BR>
Journeyed through the fen and forest.<BR>
On a hillock sat a maiden,<BR>
Sat a virgin of the valley;<BR>
And the maiden was not weeping,<BR>
Joyful was the sylvan daughter,<BR>
Singing with the woodland songsters,<BR>
That the eventide might hasten,<BR>
In the hope that her beloved<BR>
Would the sooner sit beside her.</P>
<P>Wainamoinen, old and trusted,<BR>
Hastened, tripping to the virgin,<BR>
Asked her for her golden ringleta,<BR>
These the words of the magician.<BR>
"Give me, maiden, of thy tresses,<BR>
Give to me thy golden ringlets;<BR>
I will weave them into harp-strings,<BR>
To the joy of Wainamoinen,<BR>
To the pleasure of his people."</P>
<P>Thereupon the forest-maiden<BR>
Gave the singer of her tresses,<BR>
Gave him of her golden ringlets,<BR>
And of these he made the harp-strings.<BR>
Sources of eternal pleasure<BR>
To the people of Wainola.</P>
<P>Thus the sacred harp is finished,<BR>
And the minstrel, Wainamoinen,<BR>
Sits upon the rock of joyance,<BR>
Takes the harp within his fingers,<BR>
Turns the arch up, looking skyward;<BR>
With his knee the arch supporting,<BR>
Sets the strings in tuneful order,<BR>
Runs his fingers o'er the harp-strings,<BR>
And the notes of pleasure follow.<BR>
Straightway ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
The eternal wisdom-singer,<BR>
Plays upon his harp of birch-wood.<BR>
Far away is heard the music,<BR>
Wide the harp of joy re-echoes;<BR>
Mountains dance and valleys listen,<BR>
Flinty rocks are tom asunder,<BR>
Stones are hurled upon the waters,<BR>
Pebbles swim upon the Big-Sea,<BR>
Pines and lindens laugh with pleasure,<BR>
Alders skip about the heather,<BR>
And the aspen sways in concord.</P>
<P>All the daughters of Wainola<BR>
Straightway leave their shining needles,<BR>
Hasten forward like the current,<BR>
Speed along like rapid rivers,<BR>
That they may enjoy and wonder.<BR>
Laugh the younger men and maidens,<BR>
Happy-hearted are the matrons<BR>
Flying swift to bear the playing,<BR>
To enjoy the common pleasure,<BR>
Hear the harp of Wainamoinen.<BR>
Aged men and bearded seniors,<BR>
Gray-haired mothers with their daughters<BR>
Stop in wonderment and listen.<BR>
Creeps the babe in full enjoyment<BR>
As he hears the magic singing,<BR>
Hears the harp of Wainamoinen.<BR>
All of Northland stops in wonder,<BR>
Speaks in unison these measures:<BR>
"Never have we heard such playing,<BR>
Never heard such strains of music,<BR>
Never since the earth was fashioned,<BR>
As the songs of this magician,<BR>
This sweet singer, Wainamoinen!"</P>
<P>Far and wide the sweet tones echo,<BR>
Ring throughout the seven hamlets,<BR>
O'er the seven islands echo;<BR>
Every creature of the Northland<BR>
Hastens forth to look and listen,<BR>
Listen to the songs of gladness,<BR>
To the harp of Wainamoinen.<BR>
All the beasts that haunt the woodlands<BR>
Fall upon their knees and wonder<BR>
At the playing of the minstrel,<BR>
At his miracles of concord.<BR>
All the songsters of the forests<BR>
Perch upon the trembling branches,<BR>
Singing to the wondrous playing<BR>
Of the harp of Wainamoinen.<BR>
All the dwellers of the waters<BR>
Leave their beds, and eaves, and grottoes,<BR>
Swim against the shore and listen<BR>
To the playing of the minstrel,<BR>
To the harp of Wainamoinen.<BR>
All the little things in nature,<BR>
Rise from earth, and fall from ether,<BR>
Come and listen to the music,<BR>
To the notes of the enchanter,<BR>
To the songs of the magician,<BR>
To the harp of Wainamoinen.</P>
<P>Plays the singer of the Northland,<BR>
Plays in miracles of sweetness,<BR>
Plays one day, and then a second,<BR>
Plays the third from morn till even;<BR>
Plays within the halls and cabins,<BR>
In the dwellings of his people,<BR>
Till the floors and ceilings echo,<BR>
Till resound the roofs of pine-wood,<BR>
Till the windows speak and tremble,<BR>
Till the portals echo joyance,<BR>
And the hearth-stones sing in pleasure.<BR>
As he journeys through the forest,<BR>
As he wanders through the woodlands,<BR>
Pine and sorb-tree bid him welcome,<BR>
Birch and willow bend obeisance,<BR>
Beech and aspen bow submission;<BR>
And the linden waves her branches<BR>
To the measure of his playing,<BR>
To the notes of the magician.<BR>
As the minstrel plays and wanders,<BR>
Sings upon the mead and heather,<BR>
Glen and hill his songs re-echo,<BR>
Ferns and flowers laugh in pleasure,<BR>
And the shrubs attune their voices<BR>
To the music of the harp-strings,<BR>
To the songs of Wainamoinen.</P>
