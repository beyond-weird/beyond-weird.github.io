<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">THE FATE OF AINO.</H1>
<P>WHEN the night had passed, the maiden,<BR>
Sister fair of Youkahainen,<BR>
Hastened early to the forest,<BR>
Birchen shoots for brooms to gather,<BR>
Went to gather birchen tassels;<BR>
Bound a bundle for her father,<BR>
Bound a birch-broom for her mother,<BR>
Silken tassels for her sister.<BR>
Straightway then she hastened homeward,<BR>
By a foot-path left the forest;<BR>
As she neared the woodland border,<BR>
Lo! the ancient Wainamoinen,<BR>
Quickly spying out the maiden,<BR>
As she left the birchen woodland,<BR>
Trimly dressed in costly raiment,<BR>
And the minstrel thus addressed her:<BR>
"Aino, beauty of the Northland,<BR>
Wear not, lovely maid, for others,<BR>
Only wear for me, sweet maiden,<BR>
Golden cross upon thy bosom,<BR>
Shining pearls upon thy shoulders;<BR>
Bind for me thine auburn tresses,<BR>
Wear for me thy golden braidlets."<BR>
Thus the maiden quickly answered:<BR>
"Not for thee and not for others,<BR>
Hang I from my neck the crosslet,<BR>
Deck my hair with silken ribbons;<BR>
Need no more the many trinkets<BR>
Brought to me by ship or shallop;<BR>
Sooner wear the simplest raiment,<BR>
Feed upon the barley bread-crust,<BR>
Dwell forever with my mother<BR>
In the cabin with my father."</P>
<P>Then she threw the gold cross from her,<BR>
Tore the jewels from her fingers,<BR>
Quickly loosed her shining necklace,<BR>
Quick untied her silken ribbons,<BR>
Cast them all away indignant<BR>
Into forest ferns and flowers.<BR>
Thereupon the maiden, Aino,<BR>
Hastened to her mother's cottage.</P>
<P>At the window sat her father<BR>
Whittling on an oaken ax-helve:<BR>
"Wherefore weepest, beauteous Aino,<BR>
Aino, my beloved daughter?</P>
<P>"Cause enough for weeping, father,<BR>
Good the reasons for my mourning,<BR>
This, the reason for my weeping,<BR>
This, the cause of all my sorrow:<BR>
From my breast I tore the crosslet,<BR>
From my belt, the clasp of copper,<BR>
From my waist, the belt of silver,<BR>
Golden was my pretty crosslet."</P>
<P>Near the door-way sat her brother,<BR>
Carving out a birchen ox-bow:<BR>
"Why art weeping, lovely Aino,<BR>
Aino, my devoted sister?"</P>
<P>"Cause enough for weeping, brother,<BR>
Good the reasons for my mourning<BR>
Therefore come I as thou seest,<BR>
Rings no longer on my fingers,<BR>
On my neck no pretty necklace;<BR>
Golden were the rings thou gavest,<BR>
And the necklace, pearls and silver!"</P>
<P>On the threshold sat her sister,<BR>
Weaving her a golden girdle:<BR>
"Why art weeping, beauteous Aino,<BR>
Aino, my beloved sister?"</P>
<P>"Cause enough for weeping, sister,<BR>
Good the reasons for my sorrow:<BR>
Therefore come I as thou seest,<BR>
On my head no scarlet fillet,<BR>
In my hair no braids of silver,<BR>
On mine arms no purple ribbons,<BR>
Round my neck no shining necklace,<BR>
On my breast no golden crosslet,<BR>
In mine ears no golden ear-rings."</P>
<P>Near the door-way of the dairy,<BR>
Skimming cream, sat Aino's mother.<BR>
"Why art weeping, lovely Aino,<BR>
Aino, my devoted daughter?"<BR>
Thus the sobbing maiden answered;<BR>
"Loving mother, all-forgiving,<BR>
Cause enough for this my weeping,<BR>
Good the reasons for my sorrow,<BR>
Therefore do I weep, dear mother:<BR>
I have been within the forest,<BR>
Brooms to bind and shoots to gather,<BR>
There to pluck some birchen tassels;<BR>
Bound a bundle for my father,<BR>
Bound a second for my mother,<BR>
Bound a third one for my brother,<BR>
For my sister silken tassels.<BR>
Straightway then I hastened homeward,<BR>
By a foot-path left the forest;<BR>
As I reached the woodland border<BR>
Spake Osmoinen from the cornfield,<BR>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<BR>
'Wear not, beauteous maid, for others,<BR>
Only wear for me, sweet maiden,<BR>
On thy breast a golden crosslet,<BR>
Shining pearls upon thy shoulders,<BR>
Bind for me thine auburn tresses,<BR>
Weave for me thy silver braidlets.'<BR>
Then I threw the gold-cross from me,<BR>
Tore the jewels from my fingers,<BR>
Quickly loosed my shining necklace,<BR>
Quick untied my silken ribbons,<BR>
Cast them all away indignant,<BR>
Into forest ferns and flowers.<BR>
Then I thus addressed the singer:<BR>
'Not for thee and not for others,<BR>
Hang I from my neck the crosslet,<BR>
Deck my hair with silken ribbons;<BR>
Need no more the many trinkets,<BR>
Brought to me by ship and shallop;<BR>
Sooner wear the simplest raiment,<BR>
Feed upon the barley bread-crust,<BR>
Dwell forever with my mother<BR>
In the cabin with my father.'"</P>
<P>Thus the gray-haired mother answered<BR>
Aino, her beloved daughter:<BR>
"Weep no more, my lovely maiden,<BR>
Waste no more of thy sweet young-life;<BR>
One year eat thou my sweet butter,<BR>
It will make thee strong and ruddy;<BR>
Eat another year fresh bacon,<BR>
It will make thee tall and queenly;<BR>
Eat a third year only dainties,<BR>
It will make thee fair and lovely.<BR>
Now make haste to yonder hill-top,<BR>
To the store-house on the mountain,<BR>
Open there the large compartment,<BR>
Thou will find it filled with boxes,<BR>
Chests and cases, trunks and boxes;<BR>
Open thou the box, the largest,<BR>
Lift away the gaudy cover,<BR>
Thou will find six golden girdles,<BR>
Seven rainbow-tinted dresses,<BR>
Woven by the Moon's fair daughters,<BR>
Fashioned by the Sun's sweet virgins.<BR>
In my young years once I wandered,<BR>
As a maiden on the mountains,<BR>
In the happy days of childhood,<BR>
Hunting berries in the coppice;<BR>
There by chance I heard the daughters<BR>
Of the Moon as they were weaving;<BR>
There I also heard the daughters<BR>
Of the Sun as they were spinning<BR>
On the red rims of the cloudlets,<BR>
O'er the blue edge of the forest,<BR>
On the border of the pine-wood,<BR>
On a high and distant mountain.<BR>
I approached them, drawing nearer,<BR>
Stole myself within their hearing,<BR>
Then began I to entreat them,<BR>
Thus besought them, gently pleading:<BR>
'Give thy silver, Moon's fair daughters,<BR>
To a poor, but worthy maiden;<BR>
Give thy gold, O Sun's sweet virgins,<BR>
To this maiden, young and needy.'<BR>
Thereupon the Moon's fair daughters<BR>
Gave me silver from their coffers;<BR>
And the Sun's sweet shining virgins<BR>
Gave me gold from their abundance,<BR>
Gold to deck my throbbing temples,<BR>
For my hair the shining silver.<BR>
Then I hastened joyful homeward,<BR>
Richly laden with my treasures,<BR>
Happy to my mother's cottage;<BR>
Wore them one day, than a second,<BR>
Then a third day also wore them,<BR>
Took the gold then from my temples,<BR>
From my hair I took the silver,<BR>
Careful laid them in their boxes,<BR>
Many seasons have they lain there,<BR>
Have not seen them since my childhood.<BR>
Deck thy brow with silken ribbon,<BR>
Trim with gold thy throbbing temples,<BR>
And thy neck with pearly necklace,<BR>
Hang the gold-cross on thy bosom,<BR>
Robe thyself in pure, white linen<BR>
Spun from flax of finest fiber;<BR>
Wear withal the richest short-frock,<BR>
Fasten it with golden girdle;<BR>
On thy feet, put silken stockings,<BR>
With the shoes of finest leather;<BR>
Deck thy hair with golden braidlets,<BR>
Bind it well with threads of silver;<BR>
Trim with rings thy fairy fingers,<BR>
And thy hands with dainty ruffles;<BR>
Come bedecked then to thy chamber,<BR>
Thus return to this thy household,<BR>
To the greeting of thy kindred,<BR>
To the joy of all that know thee,<BR>
Flushed thy cheeks as ruddy berries,<BR>
Coming as thy father's sunbeam,<BR>
Walking beautiful and queenly,<BR>
Far more beautiful than moonlight."</P>
<P>Thus she spake to weeping Aino,<BR>
Thus the mother to her daughter;<BR>
But the maiden, little bearing,<BR>
Does not heed her mother's wishes;<BR>
Straightway hastens to the court-yard,<BR>
There to weep in bitter sorrow,<BR>
All alone to weep in anguish.</P>
<P>Waiting long the wailing Aino<BR>
Thus at last soliloquizes:<BR>
"Unto what can I now liken<BR>
Happy homes and joys of fortune?<BR>
Like the waters in the river,<BR>
Like the waves in yonder lakelet,<BR>
Like the crystal waters flowing.<BR>
Unto what, the biting sorrow<BR>
Of the child of cold misfortune?<BR>
Like the spirit of the sea-duck,<BR>
Like the icicle in winter,<BR>
Water in the well imprisoned.<BR>
Often roamed my mind in childhood,<BR>
When a maiden free and merry,<BR>
Happily through fen and fallow,<BR>
Gamboled on the meads with lambkins,<BR>
Lingered with the ferns and flowers,<BR>
Knowing neither pain nor trouble;<BR>
Now my mind is filled with sorrow,<BR>
Wanders though the bog and stubble,<BR>
Wanders weary through the brambles,<BR>
Roams throughout the dismal forest,<BR>
Till my life is filled with darkness,<BR>
And my spirit white with anguish.<BR>
Better had it been for Aino<BR>
Had she never seen the sunlight,<BR>
Or if born had died an infant,<BR>
Had not lived to be a maiden<BR>
In these days of sin and sorrow,<BR>
Underneath a star so luckless.<BR>
Better had it been for Aino,<BR>
Had she died upon the eighth day<BR>
After seven nights had vanished;<BR>
Needed then but little linen,<BR>
Needed but a little coffin,<BR>
And a grave of smallest measure;<BR>
Mother would have mourned a little,<BR>
Father too perhaps a trifle,<BR>
Sister would have wept the day through,<BR>
Brother might have shed a tear-drop,<BR>
Thus had ended all the mourning."</P>
<P>Thus poor Aino wept and murmured,<BR>
Wept one day, and then a second,<BR>
Wept a third from morn till even,<BR>
When again her mother asked her:<BR>
"Why this weeping, fairest daughter,<BR>
Darling daughter, why this grieving?<BR>
Thus the tearful maiden answered:<BR>
Therefore do I weep and sorrow,<BR>
Wretched maiden all my life long,<BR>
Since poor Aino, thou hast given,<BR>
Since thy daughter thou hast promised<BR>
To the aged Wainamoinen,<BR>
Comfort to his years declining<BR>
Prop to stay him when he totters,<BR>
In the storm a roof above him,<BR>
In his home a cloak around him;<BR>
Better far if thou hadst sent me<BR>
Far below the salt-sea surges,<BR>
To become the whiting's sister,<BR>
And the friend of perch and salmon;<BR>
Better far to ride the billows,<BR>
Swim the sea-foam as a mermaid,<BR>
And the friend of nimble fishes,<BR>
Than to be an old man's solace,<BR>
Prop to stay him when be totters,<BR>
Hand to aid him when he trembles,<BR>
Arm to guide him when he falters,<BR>
Strength to give him when he weakens;<BR>
Better be the whiting's sister<BR>
And the friend of perch and salmon,<BR>
Than an old man's slave and darling."</P>
<P>Ending thus she left her mother,<BR>
Straightway hastened to the mountain?<BR>
To the store-house on the summit,<BR>
Opened there the box the largest,<BR>
From the box six lids she lifted,<BR>
Found therein six golden girdles,<BR>
Silken dresses seven in number.<BR>
Choosing such as pleased her fancy,<BR>
She adorned herself as bidden,<BR>
Robed herself to look her fairest,<BR>
Gold upon her throbbing temples,<BR>
In her hair the shining silver,<BR>
On her shoulders purple ribbons,<BR>
Band of blue around her forehead,<BR>
Golden cross, and rings, and jewels,<BR>
Fitting ornaments to beauty.</P>
<P>Now she leaves her many treasures,<BR>
Leaves the store-house on the mountain,<BR>
Filled with gold and silver trinkets,<BR>
Wanders over field and meadow,<BR>
Over stone-fields waste and barren,<BR>
Wanders on through fen and forest,<BR>
Through the forest vast and cheerless,<BR>
Wanders hither, wanders thither,<BR>
Singing careless as she wanders,<BR>
This her mournful song and echo:<BR>
"Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<BR>
Woe to Aino, broken-hearted!<BR>
Torture racks my heart and temples,<BR>
Yet the sting would not be deeper,<BR>
Nor the pain and anguish greater,<BR>
If beneath this weight of sorrow,<BR>
In my saddened heart's dejection,<BR>
I should yield my life forever,<BR>
Now unhappy, I should perish!<BR>
Lo! the time has come for Aino<BR>
From this cruel world to hasten,<BR>
To the kingdom of Tuoni,<BR>
To the realm of the departed,<BR>
To the isle of the hereafter.<BR>
Weep no more for me, O Father,<BR>
Mother dear, withhold thy censure,<BR>
Lovely sister, dry thine eyelids,<BR>
Do not mourn me, dearest brother,<BR>
When I sink beneath the sea-foam,<BR>
Make my home in salmon-grottoes,<BR>
Make my bed in crystal waters,<BR>
Water-ferns my couch and pillow."</P>
<P>All day long poor Aino wandered,<BR>
All the next day, sad and weary,<BR>
So the third from morn till evening,<BR>
Till the cruel night enwrapped her,<BR>
As she reached the sandy margin,<BR>
Reached the cold and dismal sea-shore,<BR>
Sat upon the rock of sorrow,<BR>
Sat alone in cold and darkness,<BR>
Listened only to the music<BR>
Of the winds and rolling billows,<BR>
Singing all the dirge of Aino.<BR>
All that night the weary maiden<BR>
Wept and wandered on the border<BR>
Through the sand and sea-washed pebbles.</P>
<P>As the day dawns, looking round her,<BR>
She beholds three water-maidens,<BR>
On a headland jutting seaward,<BR>
Water-maidens four in number,<BR>
Sitting on the wave-lashed ledges,<BR>
Swimming now upon the billows,<BR>
Now upon the rocks reposing.<BR>
Quick the weeping maiden, Aino,<BR>
Hastens there to join the mermaids,<BR>
Fairy maidens of the waters.<BR>
Weeping Aino, now disrobing,<BR>
Lays aside with care her garments,<BR>
Hangs her silk robes on the alders,<BR>
Drops her gold-cross on the sea-shore,<BR>
On the aspen hangs her ribbons,<BR>
On the rocks her silken stockings,<BR>
On the grass her shoes of deer-skin,<BR>
In the sand her shining necklace,<BR>
With her rings and other jewels.</P>
<P>Out at sea a goodly distance,<BR>
Stood a rock of rainbow colors,<BR>
Glittering in silver sunlight.<BR>
Toward it springs the hapless maiden,<BR>
Thither swims the lovely Aino,<BR>
Up the standing-stone has clambered,<BR>
Wishing there to rest a moment,<BR>
Rest upon the rock of beauty;<BR>
When upon a sudden swaying<BR>
To and fro among the billows,<BR>
With a crash and roar of waters<BR>
Falls the stone of many colors,<BR>
Falls upon the very bottom<BR>
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea.<BR>
With the stone of rainbow colors,<BR>
Falls the weeping maiden, Aino,<BR>
Clinging to its craggy edges,<BR>
Sinking far below the surface,<BR>
To the bottom of the blue-sea.<BR>
Thus the weeping maiden vanished.<BR>
Thus poor Aino sank and perished,<BR>
Singing as the stone descended,<BR>
Chanting thus as she departed:<BR>
Once to swim I sought the sea-side,<BR>
There to sport among the billows;<BR>
With the stone or many colors<BR>
Sank poor Aino to the bottom<BR>
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,<BR>
Like a pretty son-bird. perished.<BR>
Never come a-fishing, father,<BR>
To the borders of these waters,<BR>
Never during all thy life-time,<BR>
As thou lovest daughter Aino.</P>
<P>"Mother dear, I sought the sea-side,<BR>
There to sport among the billows;<BR>
With the stone of many colors,<BR>
Sank poor Aino to the bottom<BR>
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,<BR>
Like a pretty song-bird perished.<BR>
Never mix thy bread, dear mother,<BR>
With the blue-sea's foam and waters,<BR>
Never during all thy life-time,<BR>
As thou lovest daughter Aino.<BR>
Brother dear, I sought the sea-side,<BR>
There to sport among the billows;<BR>
With the stone of many colors<BR>
Sank poor Aino to the bottom<BR>
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,<BR>
Like a pretty song-bird perished.<BR>
Never bring thy prancing war-horse,<BR>
Never bring thy royal racer,<BR>
Never bring thy steeds to water,<BR>
To the borders of the blue-sea,<BR>
Never during all thy life-time,<BR>
As thou lovest sister Aino.</P>
<P>"Sister dear, I sought the sea-side,<BR>
There to sport among the billows;<BR>
With the stone of many colors<BR>
Sank poor Aino to the bottom<BR>
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,<BR>
Like a pretty song-bird perished.<BR>
Never come to lave thine eyelids<BR>
In this rolling wave and sea-foam,<BR>
Never during all thy life-time,<BR>
As thou lovest sister Aino.<BR>
All the waters in the blue-sea<BR>
Shall be blood of Aino's body;<BR>
All the fish that swim these waters<BR>
Shall be Aino's flesh forever;<BR>
All the willows on the sea-side<BR>
Shall be Aino's ribs hereafter;<BR>
All the sea-grass on the margin<BR>
Will have grown from Aino's tresses."</P>
<P>Thus at last the maiden vanished,<BR>
Thus the lovely Aino perished.<BR>
Who will tell the cruel story,<BR>
Who will bear the evil tidings<BR>
To the cottage of her mother,<BR>
Once the home of lovely Aino?<BR>
Will the bear repeat the story,<BR>
Tell the tidings to her mother?<BR>
Nay, the bear must not be herald,<BR>
He would slay the herds of cattle.<BR>
Who then tell the cruel story,<BR>
Who will bear the evil tidings<BR>
To the cottage of her father,<BR>
Once the home of lovely Aino?<BR>
Shall the wolf repeat the story,<BR>
Tell the sad news to her father?<BR>
Nay, the wolf must not be herald,<BR>
He would eat the gentle lambkins.</P>
<P>Who then tell the cruel story,<BR>
Who will bear the evil tidings.<BR>
To the cottage of her sister?<BR>
'Will the fox repeat the story<BR>
Tell the tidings to her sister?<BR>
Nay, the fox must not be herald,<BR>
He would eat the ducks and chickens.</P>
<P>Who then tell the cruel story,<BR>
Who will bear the evil tidings<BR>
To the cottage of her brother,<BR>
Once the home of lovely Aino?<BR>
Shall the hare repeat the story,<BR>
Bear the sad news to her brother?<BR>
Yea, the hare shall be the herald,<BR>
Tell to all the cruel story.<BR>
Thus the harmless hare makes answer:<BR>
"I will bear the evil tidings<BR>
To the former home of Aino,<BR>
Tell the story to her kindred."</P>
<P>Swiftly flew the long-eared herald,<BR>
Like the winds be hastened onward,<BR>
Galloped swift as flight of eagles;<BR>
Neck awry he bounded forward<BR>
Till he gained the wished-for cottage,<BR>
Once the home of lovely Aino.<BR>
Silent was the home, and vacant;<BR>
So he hastened to the bath-house,<BR>
Found therein a group of maidens,<BR>
Working each upon a birch-broom.<BR>
Sat the hare upon the threshold,<BR>
And the maidens thus addressed him:<BR>
"Hie e there, Long-legs, or we'll roast thee,<BR>
Hie there, Big-eye, or we'll stew thee,<BR>
Roast thee for our lady's breakfast,<BR>
Stew thee for our master's dinner,<BR>
Make of thee a meal for Aino,<BR>
And her brother, Youkahainen!<BR>
Better therefore thou shouldst gallop<BR>
To thy burrow in the mountains,<BR>
Than be roasted for our dinners."</P>
<P>Then the haughty hare made answer,<BR>
Chanting thus the fate of Aino:<BR>
"Think ye not I journey hither,<BR>
To be roasted in the skillet,<BR>
To be stewed in yonder kettle<BR>
Let fell Lempo fill thy tables!<BR>
I have come with evil tidings,<BR>
Come to tell the cruel story<BR>
Of the flight and death of Aino,<BR>
Sister dear of Youkahainen.<BR>
With the stone of many colors<BR>
Sank poor Aino to the bottom<BR>
Of the deep and boundless waters,<BR>
Like a pretty song-bird perished;<BR>
Hung her ribbons on the aspen,<BR>
Left her gold-cross on the sea-shore,<BR>
Silken robes upon the alders,<BR>
On the rocks her silken stockings,<BR>
On the grass her shoes of deer-skin,<BR>
In the sand her shining necklace,<BR>
In the sand her rings and jewels;<BR>
In the waves, the lovely Aino,<BR>
Sleeping on the very bottom<BR>
Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,<BR>
In the caverns of the salmon,<BR>
There to be the whiting's sister<BR>
And the friend of nimble fishes."</P>
<P>Sadly weeps the ancient mother<BR>
From her blue-eyes bitter tear-drops,<BR>
As in sad and wailing measures,<BR>
Broken-hearted thus she answers:<BR>
"Listen, all ye mothers, listen,<BR>
Learn from me a tale of wisdom:<BR>
Never urge unwilling daughters<BR>
From the dwellings of their fathers,<BR>
To the bridegrooms that they love not,<BR>
Not as I, inhuman mother,<BR>
Drove away my lovely Aino,<BR>
Fairest daughter of the Northland."</P>
<P>Sadly weeps the gray-haired mother,<BR>
And the tears that fall are bitter,<BR>
Flowing down her wrinkled visage,<BR>
Till they trickle on her bosom;<BR>
Then across her heaving bosom,<BR>
Till they reach her garment's border;<BR>
Then adown her silken stockings,<BR>
Till they touch her shoes of deer-skin;<BR>
Then beneath her shoes of deer-skin,<BR>
Flowing on and flowing ever,<BR>
Part to earth as its possession,<BR>
Part to water as its portion.<BR>
As the tear-drops fall and mingle,<BR>
Form they streamlets three in number,<BR>
And their source, the mother's eyelids,<BR>
Streamlets formed from pearly tear-drops,<BR>
Flowing on like little rivers,<BR>
And each streamlet larger growing,<BR>
Soon becomes a rushing torrent<BR>
In each rushing, roaring torrent<BR>
There a cataract is foaming,<BR>
Foaming in the silver sunlight;<BR>
From the cataract's commotion<BR>
Rise three pillared rocks in grandeur;<BR>
From each rock, upon the summit,<BR>
Grow three hillocks clothed in verdure;<BR>
From each hillock, speckled birches,<BR>
Three in number, struggle skyward;<BR>
On the summit of each birch-tree<BR>
Sits a golden cuckoo calling,<BR>
And the three sing, all in concord:<BR>
"Love! O Love! the first one calleth;<BR>
Sings the second, Suitor! Suitor!<BR>
And the third one calls and echoes,<BR>
"Consolation! Consolation!"<BR>
He that "Love! O Love!" is calling,<BR>
Calls three moons and calls unceasing,<BR>
For the love-rejecting maiden<BR>
Sleeping in the deep sea-castles.<BR>
He that "Suitor! Suitor!" singeth,<BR>
Sings six moons and sings unceasing<BR>
For the suitor that forever<BR>
Sings and sues without a hearing.<BR>
He that sadly sings and echoes,<BR>
"Consolation! Consolation!"<BR>
Sings unceasing all his life long<BR>
For the broken-hearted mother<BR>
That must mourn and weep forever.</P>
<P>When the lone and wretched mother<BR>
Heard the sacred cuckoo singing,<BR>
Spake she thus, and sorely weeping:<BR>
"When I hear the cuckoo calling,<BR>
Then my heart is filled with sorrow;<BR>
Tears unlock my heavy eyelids,<BR>
Flow adown my, furrowed visage,<BR>
Tears as large as silver sea pearls;<BR>
Older grow my wearied elbows,<BR>
Weaker ply my aged fingers,<BR>
Wearily, in all its members,<BR>
Does my body shake in palsy,<BR>
When I hear the cuckoo singing,<BR>
Hear the sacred cuckoo calling."</P>
