<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">UNDER THE MOON.</H3>
<P>I have no happiness in dreaming of Brycelinde;<BR>
Nor Avalon the grass green hollow, nor Joyous Isle,<BR>
Where one found Lancelot crazed and hid him for a while,<BR>
Nor Ulad when Naoise had thrown a sail upon the wind,<BR>
Nor lands that seem too dim to be burdens on the heart,<BR>
Land-under-Wave, where out of the moon's light and the sun's<BR>
Seven old sisters wind the threads of the long lived ones,<BR>
Land-of-the-Tower, where Aengus has thrown the gates apart, <A NAME="page_28"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 28</FONT></A><BR>
And Wood-of-Wonders, where one kills an ox at dawn<BR>
To find it when night falls laid on a golden bier:<BR>
Therein are many queens like Branwen, and Guinivere;<BR>
And Niam, and Laban, and Fand, who could change to an otter or fawn<BR>
And the wood-woman whose love was changed to a blue-eyed hawk;<BR>
And whether I go in my dreams by woodland, or dun, or shore,<BR>
Or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the oar,<BR>
I hear the harp string praise them or hear their mournful talk.<BR>
Because of a story I heard under the thin horn<BR>
Of the third moon, that hung between the night and the day,<BR>
To dream of women whose beauty was folded in dismay,<BR>
Even in an old story, is a burden not to be borne.</P>
