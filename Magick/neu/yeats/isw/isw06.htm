<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE WITHERING OF THE BOUGHS.</H3>
<P>I cried when the moon was murmuring to the birds,<BR>
'Let peewit call and curlew cry where they will,<BR>
I long for your merry and tender and pitiful words,<BR>
For the roads are unending and there is no place to my mind.'<BR>
The honey-pale Moon lay low on the sleepy hill<BR>
And I fell asleep upon lonely Echtge of streams;<BR>
No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind,<BR>
The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</P>
<P>I know of the leafy paths that the witches take,<BR>
Who come with their crowns of pearl and their spindles of wool, <A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A><BR>
And their secret smile, out of the depths of the lake;<BR>
And of apple islands where the Danaan kind<BR>
Wind and unwind their dances when the light grows cool<BR>
On the island lawns, their feet where the pale foam gleams;<BR>
No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind,<BR>
The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</P>
<P>I know of the sleepy country, where swans fly round<BR>
Coupled with golden chains and sing as they fly,<BR>
A king and a queen are wandering there, and the sound<BR>
Has made them so happy and hopeless, so deaf and so blind<BR>
With wisdom, they wander till all the years have gone by; <BR>
I know, and the curlew and peewit on Echtge of streams;<BR>
No boughs have withered because of the wintry wind,<BR>
The boughs have withered because I have told them my dreams.</P>
