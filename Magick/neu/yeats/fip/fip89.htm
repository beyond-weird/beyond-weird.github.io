<P>O'Kearney, a Louthman, deeply versed in Irish lore, writes of the <I>gean-c&#257;nach</I> (love-talker) that he is "another diminutive being of the same tribe as the Lepracaun, but, unlike him, he personated love and idleness, and always appeared with a dudeen in his jaw in lonesome valleys, and it was his custom to make love to shepherdesses and milkmaids. It was considered very unlucky to meet him, and whoever was known to have ruined his fortune by devotion to the fair sex was said to have met a <I>gean-c&#257;nach</I>.

Ac., there is a long poem describing such a fairy hurling-match as the one in the story, only the fairies described as the <I>shiagh</I>, or host, wore plaids and bonnets, like Highlanders. After the hurling the fairies have a hunt, in which the poet takes part, and they swept with great rapidity through half Ireland. The poem ends with the line-</P><DIR>
