<p>THE moments passed as at a play,<br> I had the wisdom love brings forth;<br> I had my share of mother wit<br> And yet for all that I could say,<br> And though I had her praise for it,<br> A cloud blown from the cut-throat north<br> Suddenly hid love's moon away.</p>  
<p>Believing every word I said<br> I praised her body and her mind<br> Till pride had made her eyes grow bright,<br> And pleasure made her cheeks grow red,<br> And vanity her footfall light,<br> Yet we, for all that praise, could find<br> Nothing but darkness overhead.</p>  
<p>We sat as silent as a stone,<br> We knew, though she'd not said a word,<br> That even the best of love must die,<br> And had been savagely undone<br> Were it not that love upon the cry<br> Of a most ridiculous little bird<br> Tore from the clouds his marvellous moon.</p>
