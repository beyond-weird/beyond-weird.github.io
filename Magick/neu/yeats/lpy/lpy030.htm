<p>FAR off, most secret, and inviolate Rose,<br> Enfold me in my hour of hours; where those<br> Who sought thee in the Holy Sepulchre,<br> Or in the wine vat, dwell beyond the stir<br> And tumult of defeated dreams; and deep<br> Among pale eyelids, heavy with the sleep<br> Men have named beauty. Thy great leaves enfold<br> The ancient beards, the helms of ruby and gold<br> Of the crowned Magi; and the king whose eyes<br> Saw the Pierced Hands and Rood of elder rise<br> In Druid vapour and make the torches dim;<br> Till vain frenzy awoke and he died; and him<br> Who met Fand walking among flaming dew<br> By a grey shore where the wind never blew,<br> And lost the world and Emer for a kiss;<br> And him who drove the gods out of their liss,<br> And till a hundred morns had flowered red,<br> Feasted and wept the barrows of his dead;<br> And the proud dreaming king who flung the crown <A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A><br> And sorrow away, and calling bard and clown<br> Dwelt among wine-stained wanderers in deep woods;<br> And him who sold tillage, and house, and goods,<br> And sought through lands and islands numberless years,<br> Until he found with laughter and with tears,<br> A woman, of so shining loveliness,<br> That men threshed corn at midnight by a tress,<br> A little stolen tress. I, too, await<br> The hour of thy great wind of love and hate.<br> When shall the stars be blown about the sky,<br> Like the sparks blown out of a smithy, and die?<br> Surely thine hour has come, thy great wind blows,<br> Far off, most secret, and inviolate Rose?</p>
