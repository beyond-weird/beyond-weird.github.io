<p>My mother dandled me and sang,<br> "How young it is, how young!"<br> And made a golden cradle<br> That on a willow swung.</p>  
<p>"He went away," my mother sang,<br> "When I was brought to bed,"<br> And all the while her needle pulled<br> The gold and silver thread.</p>  
<p>She pulled the thread and bit the thread<br> And made a golden gown,<br> And wept because she had dreamt that I<br> Was born to wear a crown.</p>  
<p>"When she was got," my mother sang,<br> "I heard a sea-mew cry,<br> And saw a flake of the yellow foam<br> That dropped upon my thigh."</p>  
<p>How therefore could she help but braid<br> The gold into my hair,<br> And dream that I should carry<br> The golden top of care?</p>
