<p>SUDDENLY I saw the cold and rook-delighting Heaven<br> That seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice,<br> And thereupon imagination and heart were driven<br> So wild that every casual thought of that and this<br> Vanished, and left but memories, that should be out of season<br> With the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago;<br> And I took all the blame out of all sense and reason,<br> Until I cried and trembled and rocked to and fro,<br> Riddled with light. Ah! when the ghost begins to quicken,<br> Confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent<br> Out naked on the roads, as the books say, and stricken<br> By the injustice of the skies for punishment?</p>
