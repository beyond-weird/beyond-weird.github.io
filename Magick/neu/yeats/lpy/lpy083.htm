<p>You gave but will not give again<br> Until enough of Paudeen's pence<br> By Biddy's halfpennies have lain<br> To be "some sort of evidence,"<br> Before you'll put your guineas down,<br> That things it were a pride to give<br> Are what the blind and ignorant town<br> Imagines best to make it thrive.<br> What cared Duke Ercole, that bid<br> His mummers to the market place,<br> What th&#8217; onion-sellers thought or did<br> So that his Plautus set the pace<br> For the Italian comedies?<br> And Guidobaldo, when he made<br> That grammar school of courtesies<br> Where wit and beauty learned their trade<br> Upon Urbino's windy hill,<br> Had sent no runners to and fro<br> That he might learn the shepherds' will. <A NAME="page_194"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 194</FONT></A><br> And when they drove out Cosimo,<br> Indifferent how the rancour ran,<br> He gave the hours they had set free<br> To Michelozzo's latest plan<br> For the San Marco Library,<br> Whence turbulent Italy should draw<br> Delight in Art whose end is peace,<br> In logic and in natural law<br> By sucking at the dugs of Greece.</p>  
<p>Your open hand but shows our loss,<br> For he knew better how to live.<br> Let Paudeens play at pitch and toss,<br> Look up in the sun's eye and give<br> What the exultant heart calls good<br> That some new day may breed the best<br> Because you gave, not what they would<br> But the right twigs for an eagle's nest!</p>
