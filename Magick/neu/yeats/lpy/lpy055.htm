<p>THERE'S many a strong farmer<br> Whose heart would break in two,<br> If he could see the townland<br> That we are riding to;<br> Boughs have their fruit and blossom<br> At all times of the year;<br> Rivers are running over<br> With red beer and brown beer.<br> An old man plays the bagpipes<br> In a golden and silver wood;<br> Queens, their eyes blue like the ice,<br> Are dancing in a crowd.</p>  
<p>The little fox he murmured,<br> "O what of the world's bane?"<br> The sun was laughing sweetly,<br> The moon plucked at my rein;<br> But the little red fox murmured,<br> "O do not pluck at his rein,<br> He is riding to the townland<br> That is the world's bane."</p>  
<p>When their hearts are so high<br> That they would come to blows, <A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A><br> They unhook their heavy swords<br> From golden and silver boughs;<br> But all that are killed in battle<br> Awaken to life again.<br> It is lucky that their story<br> Is not known among men,<br> For O, the strong farmers<br> That would let the spade lie,<br> Their hearts would be like a cup<br> That somebody had drunk dry.</p>  
<p>The little fox he murmured,<br> "O what of the world's bane?"<br> The sun was laughing sweetly,<br> The moon plucked at my rein;<br> But the little red fox murmured,<br> "O do not pluck at his rein,<br> He is riding to the townland<br> That is the world's bane."</p>  
<p>Michael will unhook his trumpet<br> From a bough overhead,<br> And blow a little noise<br> When the supper has been spread.<br> Gabriel will come from the water<br> With a fish tail, and talk<br> Of wonders that have happened<br> On wet roads where men walk,<br> And lift up an old horn<br> Of hammered silver, and drink <A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A><br> Till he has fallen asleep<br> Upon the starry brink.</p>  
<p>The little fox he murmured,<br> "O what of the world's bane?"<br> The sun was laughing sweetly,<br> The moon plucked at my rein;<br> But the little red fox murmured,<br> "O do not pluck at his rein,<br> He is riding to the townland<br> That is the world's bane."</p>
