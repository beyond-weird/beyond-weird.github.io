<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">8d. The Slaying Of Loch&egrave;</P>
</B><P>The warriors of four of the five grand provinces of Erin bided their time in Rede Loch&egrave; in Cualnge and pitched camp and took quarters therein for that night. Medb bade her fair handmaiden from amongst her attendants to go for her to the river for water for drinking and washing. Loch&egrave; was the name of the maiden. Thereupon Loch&egrave; went, and fifty women in her train and the queen's diadem of gold on her head. </P>
<P>And Cuchulain espied them and he put a stone on his sling and cast a stone from his staff-sling at her, so that he broke the diadem of gold in three pieces and killed the maiden on her plain. Thence is Red&egrave; Loch&egrave; ('the Plain of Loch&egrave;') in Cualnge. For Cuchulain had thought, for want of acquaintance and knowledge, that it was Medb that was there. </P>
