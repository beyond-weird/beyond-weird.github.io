<p><A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A></p>  <h1 align="center">GREAT RUSSIAN STORIES.</h1>  
<p>HERE I have but little to remark that has not already been noticed by Mr. Ralston. In <a href="sfs45.htm#33">No. 33</A> I have given a pretty variant of Grimm's 'Fisherman's Wife.' In this story, which is from the Government of Moscow, there is a curious confusion between 'king' (<i>korol</i>), and 'emperor' (<i>tzar</i>). The peasant asks to be made <i>korol</i> 'king,' but is answered that an 'emperor' (<i>tzar</i>) is chosen by God. The King of Poland was formerly the mighty potentate west of Moscow, which emerged from Tartar bondage under a grand-duke, or grand-prince. This confusion may possibly imply that the story was crystallized in its present form not long after the assumption of the imperial dignity by the ruler of Muscovy.</p>  
<p>As to <a href="sfs46.htm#34">No. 34</A>, Mr. Ralston, in his 'Songs of the Russian People,' gives an account of the manner in which Ilya of Murom obtained a vast accession of strength from the still mightier hero Svyatozor (pp. 58-63). By his exploits, however, in the story which I have given, Ilya appears to have already possessed strength enough for most purposes.</p>
