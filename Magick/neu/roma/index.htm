    <P> This page links together resources at BeyondWeird about the folklore 
      of the Roma people. Also known as 'Gypsies', the Roma are nomads who originated 
      in India during the middle ages, and spread across a wide section of Eurasia, 
      preserving a unique culture and language. </P>
    <P> NOTE: The term Gypsy was applied to the Roma by outsiders, possibly in 
      the mistaken belief that they were Egyptian in origin. Some people today 
      take it to be pejorative, and at the very least its use is deprecated. Nevertheless, 
      it is used widely in the literature, particularly the pre-1922 public domain 
      books at this site, by scholars who cannot be construed as using it in a 
      derogative sense. In new material at this site we use the term 'Roma' and 
      leave the term 'Gypsy' in existing documents. </P>
