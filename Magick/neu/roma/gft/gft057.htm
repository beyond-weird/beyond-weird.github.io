<p>Campbell of Islay has shown us a Gypsy professional story-teller in London, and Paspati has shown us a Gypsy professional story-teller, the grandson of one at Constantinople. That is not much, perhaps; but there are several more indications of the transmission of folk-tales by Gypsies. <i>Bakht</i>, the R&oacute;mani word for 'luck' or 'fortune,' has passed, not merely into Albanian folk-tales, but into the Greek and Turkish languages, as I show in a footnote on <A HREF="gft072.htm#page_53">p. 53</A>; and a good many of the following seventy-six stories seem to show unmistakable tokens of the practised raconteur's art. 'Let us leave the dogs, and return to the girl,' in <a href="gft107.htm#47">No. 47</A>; 'Now we'll leave the master to stand a bit, and go back to the mother,' in <a href="gft128.htm#68">No. 68</A>; 'And I came away, told the story,' in Nos. <a href="gft066.htm#06">6</A>, <a href="gft067.htm#07">7</A>, <a href="gft068.htm#08">8</A>, and <a href="gft075.htm#15">15</A>; 'And I left them there, and came and told my story to your lordships,' in <a href="gft070.htm#10">No. 10</A>; 'I was there, and heard everything that happened,' in <a href="gft072.htm#12">No. 12</A>; 'Away I came, the tale have told,' in <a href="gft078.htm#18">No. 18</A>; 'Now you've got it,' in <a href="gft088.htm#28">No. 28</A>; 'If they are not dead, they are still alive,' in Nos. <a href="gft101.htm#41">41</A> and <a href="gft102.htm#42">42</A>, and also in Hungarian-Gypsy stories; 'The floor there was made of paper, and I came away here,' in <a href="gft103.htm#43">No. 43</A>; 'So if they are not dead, they are living together,' in <a href="gft104.htm#44">No. 44</A>; 'Excuse me for saying it,' in <a href="gft115.htm#55">No. 55</A>; 'She was delivered (pray, excuse me) of a boy,' in <a href="gft106.htm#46">No. 46</A>; 'And the last time I was there I played my harp for them, and got to go again,' in <a href="gft114.htm#54">No. 54</A>--these all sound like tags or formulas of the professional story-teller. L&eacute;on Zafiri's usual wind-up, says Paspati (p. 421), ran: 'And I too, I was there, and I ate, and I drank, and I have come to tell you the story.'</p>
