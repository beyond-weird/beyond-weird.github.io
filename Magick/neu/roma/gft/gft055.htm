</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Other Parallels.</h3>  
<p>Resemblances only less strongly marked are observable between Campbell's two stories of 'The Shifty Lad' and 'The Three Widows' and the Welsh-Gypsy story of 'Jack the Robber' (No. 68), between his ' Tale of the Soldier' (given here as a tinker story, <a href="gft134.htm#74">No. 74</A>), and my 'Ashypelt' (<a href="gft117.htm#57">No. 57</A>), and between his 'Brown Bear of the Green Glen' (<a href="gft133.htm#73">No. 73</A> here) and my 'Old King his Three Sons' (<a href="gft115.htm#55">No. 55</A>). There is also sometimes a striking similarity of phrase and idea in Gaelic and Welsh-Gypsy stories. Thus, in Campbell we get: 'The dun steed would catch the swift March wind that would be before, and the swift March wind could not catch her'; 'He went much further than I can tell or you can think'; and 'Whether dost thou like the big half of the bannock and my curse, or the little half and my blessing?' For which John Roberts gives: 'Off he went as fast as the wind, which the wind behind could not catch the wind before'; 'Now poor Jack goes . . . further than I can tell you to-night or ever intend to tell you'; and 'Which would you like best for me to make you--a little cake and to bless you, or a big cake and to curse you?' This last feature--of the big cake and curse, or the little cake and blessing--is found, to the best of my knowledge, in no folk-tale outside the British Isles; but it occurs also in the Aberdeenshire story of 'The Red Etin' (Chambers's <i>Popular Rhymes of Scotland</i>, p. 90), and in Kennedy's</p>
