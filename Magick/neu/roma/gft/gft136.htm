<p>'There was a king and a knight, as there was and will be, and as grows the fir-tree, some of it crooked and some of it straight; and he was a king of Eirinn,' said the old tinker, and then came a wicked stepmother, who was incited to evil by a wicked hen-wife. The son of the first queen was at school with twelve comrades, and they used to play at shinny every day with silver shinnies and a golden ball. The hen-wife, for certain curious rewards, gave the step-dame a magic shirt, and she sent it to her stepson, 'Sheen</p>

He refused at first, but complied at last, and the shirt was a great snake about his neck. Then he was enchanted and under spells, and all manner of adventures happened; but at last he came to the house of a wise woman who had a beautiful daughter, who fell in love with the enchanted prince, and said she must and would have him.</p>  
<p>'It will cost thee much sorrow,' said the mother.</p>  
<p>'I care not,' said the girl, 'I must have him.'</p>  
<p>'It will cost thee thy hair.'</p>  
<p>'I care not.'</p>  
<p>'It will cost thee thy right breast.'</p>  
<p>'I care not if it should cost me my life,' said the girl.</p>  
<p>And the old woman agreed to help her to her will. A caldron was prepared and filled with plants; and the king's son was put into it and stripped to the magic shirt, and the girl was stripped to the waist. And the mother stood by with a great knife, which she gave to her daughter. Then the king's son was put down in the caldron; and the great serpent, which appeared to be a shirt about his neck, changed into its own form, and sprang on the girl and fastened on her; and she cut away the hold, and the king's son was freed from the spells. Then they were married, and a golden breast was made for the lady.</p>

The serpent, then, would seem to be an emblem of evil and wisdom in Celtic popular mythology.'</FONT></p>
