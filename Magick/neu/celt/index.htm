    <p> Some of these books and texts are translations of Celtic legends and sagas; 
      others are retellings of the material, folklore, or literary works based 
      on Celtic themes. During the 19th and early 20th Century there was a resurgence 
      of interest in the folklore of Ireland, Wales and Scotland. This was reflected 
      in a huge amount of literature based on the rich Celtic mythopoetic heritage, 
      most of it very faithful to the original material, some in a more modern 
      voice.</p>
    <p> A good number of these files were originally scanned by Phillip Brown 
      for his (now defunct) Celtic Folklore website. These are indicated by [PB].

      in the ninth Century A.D. is an account of the epic battle between the mythical 
      Tuatha De Danann and Fomoire for Ireland. It has deep roots in Indo-European 
      mythology, told with Homeric grace and bawdy humor. There are many allusions 
      to ancient pre-Christian Celtic traditions. </span> <br>
      <a href="../cool/index.htm">The Cattle-Raid of Cooley (T&aacute;in B&oacute; 
      C&uacute;ailnge)</a> <span class="p-small2"> The Cattle-Raid of Cooley is
