<P>IN the name of the Lord, mine to adore, whose praise is great.<BR>
I will praise the great Ruler, whose blessing is great on an alms-deed;<BR>
The God that defends us, the God that made us, the God that will deliver us,<BR>
The God of our hope, blessed, perfect, and pure is his true happiness.<BR>
God owns us; God is above, the Triune King,<BR>
God has been felt a support to us in affliction;<BR>
God has been, by being imprisoned, in humility.<BR>
May the blessed Ruler make us free against the day of doom,<BR>
And bring us to the feast, for the sake of his meekness and lowliness,<BR>
10 And happily receive us into Paradise from the burden of sin,<BR>
And give us salvation, for the sake of his agony and five wounds,<BR>
Terrible anguish! God delivered us when he assumed flesh.<BR>
Man would have been lost, had He not ransomed him, according to his glorious ordinance.<BR>
From the bloody Cross came redemption to the whole world.<BR>
Christ the mighty Shepherd, his merits will never fail.</P>
