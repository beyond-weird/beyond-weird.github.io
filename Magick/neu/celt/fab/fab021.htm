<P>I AM Taliesin the ardent;<BR>
I will enrich the praise of baptism.<BR>
At the baptism of the ruler, the worshipper wondered,<BR>
The conflict of the rocks and rocks and plain.<BR>
There is trembling from fear of Cunedda the burner,<BR>
In Caer Weir and Caer Lliwelydd.<BR>
There is trembling from the mutual encounter.<BR>
A complete billow of fire over the seas, .<BR>
A wave in which the brave fell among his companions.<BR>
10 A hundred received his attack on the earth,<BR>
Like the roaring of the wind against the ashen spears,<BR>
His dogs raised their backs at his presence.,<BR>
They protected, and believed in his kindness.<BR>
The bards are arranged according to accurate canons.<BR>
The death of Cunedda, which I deplore, is deplored.<BR>
Deplored be the strong protector, the fearless defender,<BR>
He will assimilate, he will agree with the deep and shallow,<BR>
A deep cutting he will agree to.<BR>
(His) discourse raised up the bard stricken in poverty,<BR>
20 Harder against an enemy than a bone.<BR>
Pre-eminent is Cunedda before the furrow (<I>i.e.</I> the grave)<BR>
And the sod. His face was kept<BR>
A hundred times before there was dissolution. A door hurdle<BR>
The men of Bryniich carried in the battle.<BR>
They became pale from fear of him and his terror chill-moving.<BR>
Before the earth was the portion of his end. <A NAME="page_258"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A><BR>
Like a swarm of swift dogs about a thicket.<BR>
Sheathing (swords is) a worse cowardice than adversity.<BR>
The destiny of an annihilating sleep I deplore,<BR>
30 For the palace, for the shirt of Cunedda;<BR>
For the salt streams, for the freely-dropping sea.<BR>
For the prey, and the quantity I lose.<BR>
The sarcasm of bards that disparage I will harrow,<BR>
And others that thicken I will count.<BR>
He was to be admired in the tumult with nine hundred horse.<BR>
Before the communion of Cunedda,<BR>
There would be to me milch cows in summer,<BR>
There would be to me a steed in winter,<BR>
There would be to me bright wine and oil.<BR>
40 There would be to me a troop of slaves against any advance.<BR>
He was diligent of heat from an equally brave visitor.<BR>
A chief of lion aspect, ashes become his fellow-countrymen,<BR>
Against the son of Edern, before the supremacy of terrors,<BR>
He was fierce, dauntless, irresistible,<BR>
For the streams of death he is distressed.<BR>
He carried the shield in the pre-eminent place,<BR>
Truly valiant were his princes.<BR>
Sleepiness, and condolence, and pale front,<BR>
A good step, will destroy sleep from a believer.</P>
