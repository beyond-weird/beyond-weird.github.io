<P>LIKE a wheel revolving immense courses,<BR>
A weakening affliction is the severe compulsion of taxes,<BR>
The unjust imposition of the ardent dragon of the mountains.<BR>
Terrible is the conflict about the ports and ferries,<BR>
And the hostilities of chieftains to chieftains.<BR>
It is natural that Franks should be highly elated: they will come on a Thursday;<BR>
And for a lady's complaint there will be wars;<BR>
And the country will be wasted, and without land;<BR>
And the key of Rome will be in the hands of commanders;<BR>
10 And the Allmyn will be unable to make assaults;<BR>
And there will be happiness to the Venedotians, who will resort to the South;<BR>
And weakness to the Saxon from his treaties,<BR>
And long depravity from want of laws;<BR>
And Lloegyr will be enfeebled by the treachery of its chiefs,<BR>
And the thrusting of Franks, and tumult in ships,<BR>
And the battle of Dovyr hastening death,<BR>
A wonder for a long life to such as will hear it.<BR>
There will be a wounding through the community owing<BR>
to the disappearance of the partisans<BR>
Of the guileless dragon, dark and light. <A NAME="page_596"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 596</FONT></A><BR>
20 Powerful chiefs of noble descent.<BR>
And may He give us of his bounty a pledge<BR>
Of a portion of his feast for ever without privation!</P>
