<P>I. MAENWYN, when I was of thy age,<BR>
My garment should not be trodden under foot,<BR>
My land should not be ploughed without blood.</P>
<P>II. Maenwyn, when I was opposed to thee,<BR>
With youth attendant on me,<BR>
The foe would not break my boundary.</P>
<P>III. Maenwyn, while I was in pursuit of thee,<BR>
Following my youth,<BR>
The foe loved not the fury of my resentment.</P>
<P>IV. Maenwyn, while I was young and plump,<BR>
Addicted to fierce slaughter,<BR>
I would perform the acts of a man, though I was but a youth.</P>
<P>V. Maenwyn, take thy aim discreetly;<BR>
There is need of advice on him who is in error:<BR>
Let Maelgwn provide another mayor.</P>

<P>VI. My choice is a portion, with its sheath on it,<BR>
And sharp-pointed as a thorn;<BR>
It is not labour lost for me to whet a stone.</P>
<P>VII. A present was bestowed on me from the vale<BR>
Of Mewyrniawn, concealed in a bucket,<BR>
A sharp iron projecting from the hand.</P>
<P>VIII. Blessed be the solitary hag,<BR>
That said from the door of her cell,<BR>
"Maenwyn, do not deliver up thy knife."</P>
<P></P>
