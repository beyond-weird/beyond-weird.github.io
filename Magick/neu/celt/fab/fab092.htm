<P>SOUL, since I was made in necessity blameless<BR>
True it is, woe is me that thou shouldst have come to my design,<BR>
Neither for my own sake, nor for death, nor for end, nor for beginning.<BR>
It was with seven faculties that I was thus blessed,<BR>
With seven created beings I was placed for purification;<BR>
I was gleaming fire when I was caused to exist;<BR>
I was dust of the earth, and grief could not reach me;<BR>
I was a high wind, being less evil than good;<BR>
I was a mist on a mountain seeking supplies of stags;<BR>
10 I was blossoms of trees on the face of the earth.<BR>
If the Lord had blessed me, He would have placed me on matter.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soul, since I was made--</P>
