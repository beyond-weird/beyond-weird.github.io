<P>LET us not reproach one another, but rather mutually save ourselves.<BR>
Certain is a meeting after separation,<BR>
The appointment of a senate, and a certain conference,<BR>
And the rising from the grave after a long repose. <A NAME="page_507"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 507</FONT></A><BR>
The mighty God will keep in his power the man of correct life,<BR>
And will let fire upon the unholy people,<BR>
And lightning and thunder and wide-spread death.<BR>
Neither a solitary nor a sluggard shall pass to a place of safety.<BR>
And after peace there shall be the usages of a kingdom;<BR>
10 The three hosts shall be brought to the overpowering presence of Jesus:<BR>
A pure and blessed host like the angels;<BR>
Another host, mixed, like the people of a country;<BR>
The third host, unbaptized, a multitude that directly after death<BR>
Will proceed in a thick crowd to the side of devils,<BR>
Not one of them shall go, owing to their hideous forms,<BR>
To the place where there are flowers and dew on the pleasant land,<BR>
Where there are singers tuning their harmonious lays,<BR>
Happy will be their cogitations with the ruler of the glorious retinue;<BR>
Where the Apostles are in the kingdom of the humble,<BR>
20 Where the bounteous Creator is on his glorious throne.<BR>
May a disposition for the grave be given us; exalted is a relationship to Him;<BR>
And. before we are gathered together to mount Olivet,<BR>
May those who have fallen be victorious over death;<BR>
And work like theirs may we also do; for at the judgment day<BR>
The wonders, greatness, and puissance of the Creator none can relate.</P>
