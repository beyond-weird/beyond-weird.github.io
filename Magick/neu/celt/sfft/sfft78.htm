<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>As I was a-walking one morning in the spring,<BR>
I heard a young ploughman so sweetly to sing,<BR>
And as he was singing these words he did say,<BR>
No life is like the ploughman's in the month of May.</P>
<P>The lark in the morning rises from her nest,<BR>
And mounts in the air with the dew on her breast,<BR>
And with the jolly ploughman she'll whistle and she'll sing,<BR>
And at night she'll return to her nest back again.</P>
<P>If you walk in the fields any pleasure to find,<BR>
You may see what the ploughman enjoys in his mind;<BR>
There the corn he sows grows and the flowers do spring,<BR>
And the ploughman's as happy as a prince or a king.</P>
<P>When his day's work is done that he has to do,<BR>
Perhaps to some country walk he will go; <A NAME="page_303"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 303</FONT></A><BR>
There with a sweet lass he will dance and sing,<BR>
And at night return with his lass back again.</P>
<P>Then he rises next morning to follow his team,<BR>
Like a jolly ploughman so neat and so trim;<BR>
If he kiss a pretty girl he will make her his wife,<BR>
And she loves her jolly ploughman as dear as her life.</P>
<P>There's Molly and Dolly, Nelly and Sue;<BR>
There's Ralph, John, and Willie, and young Tommy too ;<BR>
Each lad takes his lass to the wake or the fair,<BR>
Adzooks! they look rarely I vow and declare.</P>
