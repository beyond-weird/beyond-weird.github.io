<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>A FOX had noticed for some days a family of wrens, off which he wished to dine. He might have been satisfied with one, but he was determined to have the whole lot--father and eighteen sons,--and all so like that he could not tell one from the other, or the father from the children.</P>
<P>"It is no use to kill one son," he said to himself, because the old cock will take warning and fly away with the seventeen. I wish I knew which is the old gentleman."</P>
<P>He set his wits to work to find out, and one day, seeing them all threshing in a barn, he sat down to watch them; still he could not be sure.</P>
<P>"Now I have it," he said; "well done the old man's stroke! He hits true," he cried.</P>
<P>"Oh!" replied the one he suspected of being the head of the family; "if you had seen my grandfather's strokes you might have said that."</P>
<P>The sly fox pounced on the cock, ate him up in a trice, and then soon caught and disposed of the eighteen sons, all flying in terror about the barn.</P>
