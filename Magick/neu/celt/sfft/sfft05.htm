<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>THERE was once a man that wrought in the fields, and had a wife, and a son, and a dochter. One day he caught a hare, and took it hame to his wife, and bade her make it ready for his dinner. While it was on the fire, the good-wife aye tasted and tasted at it, till she had tasted it a' away, and then she didna ken what to do for her goodman's dinner. So she cried in Johnie her son to come and get his head kaimed; and when she was kaiming his head, she slew him, and put him into the pat. Well, the goodman cam hame to his dinner, and his wife set down Johnie well boiled to him; and when he was eating, he takes up a foot, and says: "That's surely my Johnie's fit."</P>
<P>"Sic nonsense! it's ane o' the hare's," says the goodwife.</P>
<P>Sync he took up a hand, and says: "That's surely my Johnie's hand."</P>
