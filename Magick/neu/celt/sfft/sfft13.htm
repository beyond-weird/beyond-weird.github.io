<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>ONE day the fox succeeded in catching a fine fat goose asleep by the side of a loch; he held her by the wing, and making a joke of her cackling, hissing, and fears, he said--</P>
<P>"Now, if you had me in your mouth as I have you, tell me what you would do?"</P>
<P>"Why," said the goose, "that is an easy question. I would fold my hands, shut my eyes, say a grace, and then eat you."</P>
<P>"Just what I mean to do," said Rory;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and folding his hands, and looking very demure, he said a pious grace with his eyes shut.</P>
<P>But while he did this the goose had spread her wings, and she was now half way over the loch; so the fox was left to lick his lips for supper.</P>
<P>"I will make a rule of this," he said in disgust, never in all my life to say a grace again till after I feel the meat warm in my belly."</P>
