<p>When thou takest thy food, think of Him who gives it, namely, God, and whilst thinking of His Name, with the word put the first morsel in thy mouth, thank God for it, and entreat His grace and blessing upon it, that it may be for the health of thy body and mind; then thy drink in the same manner. And upon any other thing or quantity, which thou canst not take with the Name of God in thy mind, entreat His grace and blessing, lest it should prove an injury and a curse to thee.

Then what thou hast taken into thy memory and mind, thy reason and understanding, will be to thee a grace and a blessing, good for thyself, and good for all men, and the grace of God's chief blessing will dwell upon thee.</p>
