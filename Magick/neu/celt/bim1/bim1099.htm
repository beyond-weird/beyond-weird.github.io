</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">ABRED.--GWYNVYD.--AWEN.</h3>  
<p>Q. How often may one fall in Abred?</p>  
<p>A. No one will fall once of necessity, after it has been once traversed, but through negligence, from cleaving to ungodliness, until it preponderates over godliness, a man will fall in Abred. He will then return to the state of man, through every form of existence that will be necessary for the removal of the evil, which was the cause of his fall in Abred. And he will fall only once in Abred on account of the same ungodliness, since it will be overcome by that fall; nevertheless, because of many other impieties he may fall in Abred, even numberless times, until every opposition and Cythraul, that is, all ungodliness, shall have been vanquished, when there will be an end to the Abred of necessity.</p>  
<p>Q. How many have fallen in Abred? and for what cause have they fallen?</p>  
<p>A. All living beings below the circle of Gwynvyd have fallen in Abred, and are now on their return to Gwynvyd. The migration of most of them will be long, owing to the frequent times they have fallen, from having attached themselves to evil and ungodliness; and the reason why they fell was, that they desired to traverse the circle of Ceugant, which God alone could endure and traverse. Hence, they fell even unto Annwn, and it was from pride, which would</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A> <A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A></p>  
<p>ally itself with. God, that they fell, and there is no necessary fall as far as Annwn, except from pride.</p>  
<p>Q. Did all, who reached the circle of Gwynvyd after the primary progression of necessity from Annwn, fall in Abred from pride?</p>  
<p>A. No; some sought after wisdom, and hence saw what pride would do, and they resolved to conduct themselves according to what was taught them by God, and thereby became divinities, or holy angels, and they acquired learning from what they beheld in others, and it was thus that they saw the nature of Ceugant and eternity, and that God alone could endure and traverse it.</p>  
<p>Q. Does not the danger of falling in Abred, from the circle of Gwynvyd, exist still as it did formerly?</p>  
<p>A. No; because all pride and every other sin, will be overcome before one can a second time reach the circle of Gwynvyd, and then by recollecting and knowing the former evil, every one will necessarily abhor what caused him to fall before, and the necessity of hatred and love will last and continue for ever in the circle of Gwynvyd, where the three stabilities, namely, hatred, love, and knowledge, will never end.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Q. Will those, who shall return to the circle of Gwynvyd after the fall in Abred, be of the same kind as those who fell not?</p>  
<p>A. Yes; and of the same privilege, because the love of God cannot be less towards one than towards another, nor towards one form of existence than another, since He is God and Father to them all, and exercises the same amount of love and patronage towards them all, and they will all be equal and co-privileged in the circle of Gwynvyd, that is, they will be divinities and holy angels for ever.</p>  
<p>Q. Will every form and species of living existence continue for ever as they are now? If so, tell me why?</p>  
<p>A. Yes, in virtue of liberty and choice, and the blessed will go from one to another as they please, in order to repose from the fatigue and tediousness of Ceugant, which God</p>

<p>only can endure, and in order to experience every knowledge and every gwynfyd that are capable of species and form; and each one of them will hate evil of necessary obligation, and know it thoroughly, and consequently of necessity renounce it, since he will perfectly know its nature and mischievousness--God being a help, and God being chief, supporting and preserving them for ever.</p>  
<p>Q. How are these things to be known?</p>  
<p>A. The Gwyddoniaid, from the age of ages, from the time of Seth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> son of Adam, son of God, obtained Awen from God, and thence knew the mystery of godliness.; and the Gwyddoniaid were of the nation of the Cymry from the age of ages. After that, the Gwyddoniaid were regulated according to privilege and usage, in order that unfailing memory might be kept of this knowledge. After that, the Gwyddoniaid were called Bards according to the privilege and usage of the Bards of the Isle of Britain, because it was after the arrival of the Cymry in the island of Britain, that this regulation was made; and it is through the memorials of Bardism and Awen from God that this knowledge has been acquired, and no falsehood can accrue from Awen from God. In the nation of Israel were found the holy prophets, who through Awen from God knew all these things as described in the Holy Scriptures, And after Christ, the Son of God, had come in the flesh from Gwynvyd, further knowledge of God, and His will, was obtained, as is seen in St. Paul's Sermon.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_251"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> And when we, the Cymry, were converted to the faith in Christ, our Bards obtained a more clear Awen from God, and knowledge about all things divine beyond what had been seen before, and they prophesied, improving Awen and knowledge. Hence is all knowledge concerning things divine and what appertains to God.</p>

<p>Q. How is Awen to be obtained, where it is not, so that a Bard may be made of him, who would be a Bard?</p>  
<p>A. By habituating one's self to a holy life, and all love towards God and man, and all justice, and all mercy, and all generosity, and all endurance, and all peace, and practising good sciences, and avoiding pride and cruelty and adultery, and murder and ambuscade, and theft, and covetousness, and all injustice, that is, the things that will corrupt and destroy Awen, where it exists, and will prevent the obtaining it, where it does not exist.</p>  
<p>Q. Is it in the way it was first obtained, that Awen from God is still obtainable?</p>  
<p>A. It is in this way that Awen is obtained, that the truth may be known and believed. Some, however, are of opinion that the way in which the truth was first known, was, that the divinities, or holy angels, and the saints or godly men, who went to heaven, and especially Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came down from Gwynvyd to the Little World in the condition of man, in order to teach, warn, direct, and inform those who seek to be divine. That is, they came in the capacity of messengers sent by God in His infinite love, and in virtue of their own great love co-operating with the love of God, and as His obedient messengers. And we shall have what of Awen from God is necessary for us, by attaching ourselves to the good and godly with sincerity, and out of pure love for all goodness.</p>
