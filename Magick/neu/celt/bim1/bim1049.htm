</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE FIVE AGES OF LETTERS.</h3>  
<p>The five Ages of Letters. The first was the age of the three letters, which above all represented the Name of God and goodness, and which were a sign of goodness and truth, and understanding and equity, of whatsoever kind they might be. Other things were exhibited under the sign of blazonry in respect of the art of a herald-bard. This is the mode in which they numbered ten according to the three letters, namely, <A NAME="img_09500"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09500.jpg">, <A NAME="img_09501"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09501.jpg"> being put for ten, and after that <A NAME="img_09502"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09502.jpg"> for the second tenth, that is, a hundred, and <A NAME="img_09503"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09503.jpg"> for the third tenth, that is, a thousand, and <A NAME="img_09504"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09504.jpg"> for the fourth tenth, that is, a myriad, and for a million <A NAME="img_09505"></A>

<IMG SRC="img/09506.jpg">, and so on to three <A NAME="img_09507"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09507.jpg">, or four or more. According to this arrangement <A NAME="img_09508"></A>

<IMG SRC="img/09509.jpg"> for B, that is, the second, <A NAME="img_09510"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09510.jpg">, the third, <A NAME="img_09511"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/09511.jpg">, the fourth, <A NAME="img_09512"></A>
