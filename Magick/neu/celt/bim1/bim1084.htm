<p><A NAME="page_202"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 202</FONT></A> <A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. The three principal perceptions of the soul of man: love; hatred; and understanding.</p>  
<p>3. There are three things from God, namely: what cannot be had as good without; what all see that they want; and what nobody else can satisfy.</p>  
<p>4. The three residents of Ceugant: God; justice; and desirableness; and where God is, there are the other two.</p>  
<p>5. The three impossibilities of God: to hate; to become feeble; and to become too great.</p>  
<p>6. Three places where God cannot be found: where He is not asked to be; where He is not desired to be; and where He is not obeyed.</p>  
<p>7. The three purposes of God in His works: to consume the evil; to enliven the dead; and to cause joy from doing good.</p>  
<p>8. The three ways in which God works: experience; wisdom; and mercy.</p>  
<p>9. There should be three agreements in every act of man: agreement with the nature of morality; agreement with the excellences of humanity; and agreement with what can exist in every thing for ever in the circle of Gwynvyd. Others say, agreement with the commandment of God; agreement with the excellences of man; and agreement with what can exist for ever, in respect of the godliness of its existence, in the circle of Gwynvyd. Others say; with the benefit of all living beings; with the justice of God; and with the love of the circle of Gwynvyd.</p>  
<p>10. The three principal uses of all things in the hands of God: that they should be with a view to the greatest need; to the greatest utility; and to the greatest love.</p>  
<p>11. The three principal properties of the Hidden God: power; knowledge; and love.</p>  
<p>12. The three daily cares that should occupy the mind of every man: to worship God; to avoid injuring any one; and to act justly towards every living thing.</p>  
<p>13. The three fears of a wise man: the fear of offending God; the fear of acting uncharitably to man; and the fear</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A> <A NAME="page_205"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 205</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of excessive wealth and prosperity. Another version: the fear of God; the fear of sin; and the fear of excessive prosperity.</p>  
<p>14. The three fears of the foolish man: the fear of man; the fear of the devil; and the fear of poverty. Al. worldly adversity.</p>  
<p>15. In three things will a man resemble the devil: laying snares in the way; fearing a little child; and laughing at evil.</p>
