DUKE MAGNUS looked out through the castle window,<BR>
How the stream ran so rapidly;<BR>
And there he saw how upon the stream sat<BR>
A woman most fair and lovelie,</BLOCKQUOTE><DIR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Duke Magnus, Duke Magnus, plight thee to me,<BR>
I pray you still so freely;<BR>
Say me not nay, but yes, yes!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"O, to you I will give a travelling ship,<BR>
The best that a knight would guide;<BR>
It goeth as well on water as on firm land,<BR>
And through the fields all so wide.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"O, to you will I give a courser gray,<BR>
The best that a knight would ride;<BR>
He goeth as well on water as on firm land,<BR>
And through the groves all so wide."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"O, how should I plight me to you?<BR>
I never any quiet get;<BR>
I serve the king and my native land,<BR>
But with woman I match me not yet."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"To you will I give as much of gold<BR>
As for more than your life will endure;<BR>
And of pearls and precious stones handfuls;<BR>
And all shall be so pure."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"O gladly would I plight me to thee,<BR>
If thou wert of Christian kind;<BR>
But now thou art a vile sea-troll,<BR>
My love thou canst never win."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Duke Magnus, Duke Magnus, bethink thee well,<BR>
And answer not so haughtily;<BR>
For if thou wilt not plight thee to me,<BR>
Thou shalt ever crazy be."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Duke Magnus, &amp;c.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"I am a king's son so good,<BR>
How can I let you gain me?<BR>
You dwell not on land, but in the flood,<BR>
Which would not with me agree."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Duke Magnus, Duke Magnus, plight thee to me,<BR>
I offer you still so freely;<BR>
Say me not nay, but yes, yes! [a]</BLOCKQUOTE>
