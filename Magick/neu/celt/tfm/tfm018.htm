<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>SIR Olof he rode out at early day,<BR>
And so came he unto an Elve-dance gay.<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Elve-father reached out his white hand free,<BR>
"Come, come, Sir Olof, tread the dance with me."<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"O nought I will, and nought I may,<BR>
To-morrow will be my wedding-day.'<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And the Elve-mother reached out her white hand free,<BR>
"Come, come, Sir Olof, tread the dance with me."<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"O nought I will, and nought I may,<BR>
To-morrow will be my wedding-day."<BR>
The dance.it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And the Elve-sister reached out her white hand free,<BR>
"Come, come, Sir Olof, tread the dance with me."<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"O nought I will, and nought I may,<BR>
To-morrow will be my wedding-day."<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And the bride she spake with her bride-maids so,<BR>
"What may it mean that the bells thus go?"<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Tis the custom of this our isle," they replied;<BR>
"Each young swain ringeth home his bride."<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"And the truth from you to conceal I fear,<BR>
Sir Olof is dead, and lies on his bier."<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>And on the morrow, ere light was the day,<BR>
In Sir Olof's house three corpses lay.<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It was Sir Olof, his bonny bride,<BR>
And eke his mother, of sorrow she died.<BR>
The dance it goes well,<BR>
So well in the grove. [a]</BLOCKQUOTE>
