[The object of this version was to give a correct idea of the animated anapastic measure in which the Shib-Nameh Is written. Our knowledge of Persian was extremely slight; but a friendly Orientalist gave us a faithful line-for-line translation, which we versified, and he and Ram Mohun Roy then compared our version with the original.]</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>His band from the lute hath its melody drawn,<BR>
And thus rose the song of Mazender&acirc;n:--<BR>
May Mazenderan, the land of my birth,<BR>
Its hills and its dales, be e'er famed o'er the earth:<BR>
For evermore blooms in its<I> </I>gardens the rose,<BR>
On its hills nods the tulip, the hyacinth blows;<BR>
Its air ever fragrant, its earth flourishing,<BR>
Cold or heat is not felt,--'tis perpetual spring.<BR>
The nightingale's lays in the gardens resound;<BR>
On the sides of the mountains the stately deer bound,<BR>
In search evermore of their pastime and food;<BR>
With fragrance and colour each season's bedewed;<BR>
Its streams of rose-water unceasingly roll,<BR>
Whose perfume doth gladness diffuse o'er the soul<BR>
In November, December, and January,<BR>
Pull of tulips the ground thou mayest everywhere see;<BR>
The springs, unexhausted, flow all through the year;<BR>
The hawk at his chase everywhere doth appear.<BR>
The region of bliss is adorned all o'er<BR>
With dinars, with rich stuffs, and with all costly store;<BR>
The idol-adorers with fine gold are crowned,<BR>
And girdles of gold gird the heroes renowned.<BR>
Whoe'er hath not dwelt in that region so bright,<BR>
His soul knows no pleasure, his heart no delight.</BLOCKQUOTE>
