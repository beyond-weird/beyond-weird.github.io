<BLOCKQUOTE>The beetle is not killed by the people for the following reason: they have a tradition that one day the chief priests sent messengers in every direction to look for the Lord Jesus, and they came to a field where a man was reaping, and asked him--</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Did Jesus of Nazareth pass this way?"</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"No," said the man, "I have not seen him."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"But I know better," said a little clock running up, "for He was here to-day and rested, and has not long gone away."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"That is false," said a great big black. beetle, coming forward; "He has not passed since yesterday, and you will never find Him on this road; try another."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So the people kill the clock because he tried to betray Christ; but they spare the beetle and will not touch him, because he saved the Lord on that day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
