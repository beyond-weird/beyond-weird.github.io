<BLOCKQUOTE>&nbsp;When a person becomes low and depressed and careless about everything, as if all vital strength and energy had gone, he is said to have got a fairy blast. And blast-water must be poured over him by the hands of a fairy doctor while saying, "In the name of the saint with the sword, who has strength before God and stands at His right hand." Great care being taken that- no portion of the water is profaned. Whatever is left after the operation, must be poured on the fire.</BLOCKQUOTE>
