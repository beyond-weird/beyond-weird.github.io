<BLOCKQUOTE>IT is ill luck when going with a funeral to meet a man on a white horse. No matter how high the rank of the rider may be, the people must seize the reins and force him to turn back and join he procession at least for a few yards.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The three most powerful divinations are by fire, by water, and by clay. These are the three great powers--the power that ascends, which is fire; the power that falls, which is water; and the power that lies level on the earth, and has the mystery of the xead, which is clay,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If a short cut should be taken while carrying a corpse to the grave the dead will be disturbed in the coffin, for it is a slight and an insult to the corpse.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When a death was expected it was usual to have a good deal of bread ready baked in the house in order that the evil spirits might be employed eating it, and so let the soul of the dying depart in peace. Twelve candles stuck in clay should also be placed round the dying.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If two funerals meet at the same churchyard, the last corpse that enters will have to supply the dead with water till the next corpse arrives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Never take a child in your arms after being at a wake where a corpse was laid out unless you first dip your hands in holy water.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The moment the soul leaves the body the evil spirits try to seize but the guardian angel fights against them, and those around must pray earnest]y that the angel may conquer. After death the body must not be disturbed, nor should the funeral chant be raised for one hour.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are many superstitions prevalent in the Western Islands which are implicitly believed and acted on. Fishermen when going to sea must always enter the boat by the right side, no matter how inconvenient.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A coal of fire thrown after the fisherman brings him good fortune.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A sick person must not be visited on a Friday, nor by any person who has just quitted a wake and looked upon the dead. The hair and nails of a sick person must not be cut till after recovery..</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If a corpse falls to the ground the most fatal events will happen to the family.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The lid must not be nailed on the coffin of a new-born child, or the mother that bore it will never have another.</BLOCKQUOTE>
