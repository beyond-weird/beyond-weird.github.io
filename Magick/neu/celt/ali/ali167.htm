<P ALIGN="CENTER">Omens that Forebode Evil</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To stick a pxxxxxx in the mast of a boat when sailing is most unlucky,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To meet woman with red hair, or a woman with a red petticoat, the first thing in the morning.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To kill the robin redbreast.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To pass a churn and not give a helping hand.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To meet a funeral and not go back three steps with it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To have a hare cross your path before sunrise.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To take away a lighted sod on May days or churning days; for fire is the most sacred of all things, and you take away the blessing from the house along with it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>*</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Irish are very susceptible to omens. They say, "Beware of a childless woman who looks fixedly at your child."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fire is the holiest of all things. Walk three times round a fire on St. John's Eve, and you will be safe from disease for all that year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>lt is particularly unlucky to meet a red-haired man the first thing in the morning. There is a tradition that Judas Iscariot had red hair, and it is from this the superstitious dread of the evil interference of a red-haired man may have originated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Never begin work on a Friday.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Never remove from a house or leave a situation on Saturday.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Never begin to make a dress on Saturday, or the wearer will die within the year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Never mend a rent in a dress while on, or evil and malicious reports will be spread about you.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some days are unlucky to certain families--as Tuesday to the Tudors. Henry VIII., Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth all died upon a Tuesday.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To throw a slipper after a party going a journey is lucky. Also to breakfast by candle-light on Christmas morning.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is fatal at a marriage to tie a knot in a red handkerchief, and only an enemy would do it. To break the spell tire handkerchief should be burned.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The first days of the year and of the week are the luckiest. Never begin a journey on a Friday or Saturday, nor move from your residence, nor change a situation. Never cut out a dress or begin to make it on a Friday, nor fix a marriage, for of all days the fairies have the most malific power on a Friday. They are present then, and hear all that is said, therefore beware of speaking ill of them, for they will work some evil if offended.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Never pay away money on the first Monday of the year, or you will lose your luck in gaining money all the year after.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Presents may be given on New Year's Day, but no money should be paid away.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Those who marry in autumn will die in spring.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The yew-tree, the ash, and the elder-tree were sacred. The willow has a mystery in it of sound. The harp of King Brian-Boru was made of willow-wood.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When a servant leaves her place, if her mistress gives her a piece of bread let her put by some of it carefully, for as long as she has it good luck will follow her.</BLOCKQUOTE>
