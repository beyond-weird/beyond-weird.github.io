<P>
This is J. F. Campbell's four-volume collection of Scottish
folklore.
Campbell, who was fluent in Gaelic,
spent years in the field eliciting these stories from
people in all walks of life.
This was a salvage project, as the stories and the storytellers
were rapidly dying out under the impact of the dominant British culture
and the inroads of the industrial revolution.
It is because of Campbell's pioneering effort that we have a comprehensive
record of this rich vein of folklore.
</P>
<P>
This is a critical edition, which contains an extensive introduction,
variations on each tale, and endnotes.
Campbell is often cited in folklore studies,
and many other anthologies of Scottish and general
folklore include one or more stories from this collection.
</P>
<P>
The original book also includes the Gaelic text for most of the stories.
Some of the more extensive Gaelic texts had to be omitted
from this electronic version, although all the English
translations are included.
This is indicated by ellipsis marks in green.
Most short and medium length Gaelic texts are included, including all of the
Gaelic poetic texts.</P>
<P>Although this book is not currently in print, it was reprinted in paperback
by Wildwood Press in 1983, and it is easy to obtain inexpensive used copies.
