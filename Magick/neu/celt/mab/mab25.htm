<P>THE Prince who figures as the hero of the present Mabinogi, is the subject of two Triads, in one of which his singular adventures are thus alluded to:--</P>
<P>"Three Makers of Golden Shoes, of the Isle of Britain: Caswallawn the son of Beli, when he went as far as Gascony to obtain Flur, the daughter of Mygnach Gorr, who had been carried thither to C&aelig;sar the Emperor, by one called Mwrchan the Thief, king of that country and friend of Julius C&aelig;sar, and Caswallawn brought her back to the Isle of Britain; Manawyddan the son of Llyr Llediaith, when he was as far as Dyved laying restrictions; Llew Llaw Gyffes, when be was along with Gwydion, the son of Don, seeking a name and arms from Arianrod, his mother."--Triad 124.</P>
<P>In the other, he is represented as one of the humble princes of the Island, because, having cultivated minstrelsy after the captivity of his brother Bran, he would not afterwards resume his rank, although be might have done so.--Tr. 38.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_412"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 412</FONT></A></P>
<P>Manawyddan is mentioned in the Dialogue between Arthur, Kai, and Glewlwyd; and his name occurs in connexion with that of Pryderi in the Poem on the Sons of Llyr, "Kerdd meib Llyr,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of Taliesin.</P>
<P>The other principal personages whose names appear in this Mabinogi, are here passed over in silence, having been already made the subjects of various preceding notes.</P>
<P>It may be useful to remind the reader that Lloegyr is the Welsh name for the eastern and greater part of the island; and corresponds in modern usage with the word England.--See <A HREF="mab14.htm#page_210">p. 210</A>.</P>
