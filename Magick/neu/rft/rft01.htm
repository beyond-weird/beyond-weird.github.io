<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>THE literature of Roumania is so little known in England, that I have ventured to translate, and bring before the public, some of the popular <I>Basme</I> (tales) and legends of the country.</P>
<P>I have kept to the original text as strictly as possible, but some of the idioms are untranslatable.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_viii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. viii</FONT></A></P>
<P>KINGDOM; and I have thought it well to insert in this little book "The Martyrdom of Brancovan," and the Spartan courage of the "Mother of Stefan the Great," to shew of what blood the true sons and daughters of Roumania are made.</P>
