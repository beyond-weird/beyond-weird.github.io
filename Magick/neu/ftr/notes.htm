  <p>13. A <i>tsarstvo</i> is the domain of a <i>tsar</i> (czar), which is the title of an absolute monarch in Russia.
  The word <i>tsar,</i> derived from the Roman name and title, C&#230;sar, may be translated emperor, king, or prince. A
  number of words are formed from it by adding different syllables: Tsarevitch, the tsar&#39;s son, prince; Tsarevna,
  the tsar&#39;s daughter, princess; Tsaritza, the tsar&#39;s wife, queen or empress.</p>

  <p>14. <i>Boyar</i> was the word formerly used to mean a Russian nobleman; so a <i>boyar-house</i> is a lord&#39;s
  house; <i>boyarishnia,</i> a lord&#39;s daughter. The <i>terem</i> was that part of the boyar-house in which the
  women&#39;s rooms were situated.</p>

  <p>16. In Russia there is a fatherly relation existing between the ruler and his subjects which is shown in such
  phrases as &quot;the tsar father,&quot; &quot;their father sovereign,&quot; etc. The Russian language has many
  diminutives, or terms of endearment. For instance, the Tzar is often affectionately called &quot;the little
  father&quot; by his subjects.</p>

  <p>17. <i>&quot;Once said, quickly done.&quot;</i> This is the Russian idiom. Observe how much more lively it is than
  our own &quot;No sooner said than done.&quot;</p>

  <p>29. <i>The holy icons</i> are pictures or mosaics of Christ, or the Virgin Mary, or of some saint or martyr of the
  Russian church. In every Russian house there is one or more, hung in a prominent place. Every one who enters the
  house at once bows and utters a prayer before the icons before he does anything else. This is an old Russian custom
  which is still kept up by peasants.</p>

  <p>29. <i>Strong green wine.</i> This is the phrase still used by Russian story-tellers to describe the drink which
  it was an honor to receive from the royal hand. Its strength was magical in that it was not acquired by keeping, but
  was always the same.</p>

  <p>35. <i>For a cloudy day</i> is the Russian idiom very similar to our own.</p>

  <p>37. <i>It is a peasant&#39;s trade</i> is a Russian saying which means, &quot;It doesn&#39;t amount to
  much.&quot;</p>

  <p>46. <i>Moujik,</i> a peasant: his duties are those of a farm laborer, yet this phrase would not be a fair
  translation. This word, which is rendered &quot;tiller of the soil,&quot; has no exact equivalent in English.</p>

  <p>48. <i>Korolevitch,</i> from <i>korol:</i> king. The endings <i>evitch</i> and <i>evna</i> show descent,
  korolevitch meaning son of a king; korolevna meaning daughter of a king.</p>

  <p>53. <i>Dutch trumpet,</i> i. e., an imported trumpet. Anything foreign is &quot;Dutch&quot; to the Russian
  peasant.</p>

  <p>60. <i>Honey drink,</i> a drink made by fermenting honey and water. It is quite common in Russia, and is about the
  same as our mead.</p>

  <p>65. Russian and other Slavonic tales often have queer endings, similar to the one here given by the story-teller
  at the end of the story, which is no part of the tale. To the Russian they give a poetic touch, a little sense of
  confusion and mystery which is certainly delightful.</p>

  <p>66. <i>Holy Russia.</i> To the Russian his country is sacred; everything outside is profane by comparison. The
  phrase suggests the <i>Holy Roman Empire</i> of history, or the <i>Celestial Kingdom</i> of the Chinese.</p>

  <p>81. In the peasant&#39;s house there is often a large stove of brick or tile on which the family sleep in cold
  weather.</p>

  <p>83. <i>A day in and an equal day out,</i> the Russian idiom. Observe how very like our own.</p>

  <p>113. <i>Kabak,</i> a drinking saloon.</p>

  <p>115. The <i>ruble</i> is the principal coin of Russia, as</p>

  <p><a name="p.151"><font color="#0000ff">p.151</font></a></p>

  <p>the dollar is in the United States. It is equal to 100 copecks, and at this time (1903) is worth only about 50
  cents.</p>

  <p>116. <i>Honey to drink,</i> i. e., fermented honey, or mead. (See note to p. 60.)</p>

  <p>118. <i>Baba,</i> a peasant woman, or grandmother; granny. <i>Yaga,</i> witch. <i>Baba Yaga,</i> therefore, is the
  familiar &quot;Grandmother Witch.&quot;</p>

  <p>120. <i>Izba,</i> a hut. <i>Izboushka,</i> a tiny hut.</p>

  <p>143. <i>Schouba,</i> a large fur-lined cloak.</p>

  <p>145. <i>Sarafan,</i> the Russian national costume for women.</p>
