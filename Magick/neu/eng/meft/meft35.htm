<P>MR G. Ha! Steward, how are you, my old boy? How do things go on at home?</P>
<P>STEWARD. Bad enough, your honour; the magpie's dead!</P>
<P>MR G. Poor mag! so he's gone. How came he to die?</P>
<P>STEWARD. Overate himself, sir.</P>
<P>MR G. Did he indeed? A greedy dog. Why, what did he get that he liked so well?</P>
<P>STEWARD. Horseflesh; he died of eating horseflesh.</P>
<P>MR G. How came he to get so much horseflesh?</P>
<P>STEWARD. All your father's horses, sir.</P>
<P>MR G. What! are they dead, too?</P>
<P>STEWARD. Aye, sir; they died of overwork.</P>
<P>MR G. And why were they overworked?</P>
<P>STEWARD. To carry water, sir.</P>
<P>MR G. To carry water, and what were they carrying water for?</P>
<P>STEWARD. Sure, sir, to put out the fire.</P>
<P>MR G. Fire! what fire?</P>
<P>STEWARD. Your father's house is burned down to the ground.</P>
<P>MR G. My father's house burnt down! and how came it to be on fire?</P>
<P>STEWARD. I think sir, it must have been the torches.</P>
<P>MR G. Torches! what torches?</P>
<P>STEWARD. At your mother's funeral.</P>
<P>MR G. My mother dead?</P>
<P>STEWARD. Aye, poor lady, she never looked up after it.</P>
<P>MR G. After what?</P>
<P>STEWARD. The loss of your father.</P>
<P>MR G. My father gone, too?</P>
<P>STEWARD. Yes, poor gentleman, he took to his bed as soon as he heard of it.</P>
<P>MR G. Heard of what?</P>
<P>STEWARD. The bad news, an' it please your honour.</P>
<P>MR G. What? more miseries, more bad news!</P>
<P>STEWARD. Yes, sir, your bank has failed, your credit is lost and you're not worth a shilling in the world. I make bold, sir, to come and wait on you about it; for I thought you would like to hear the news.</P>
