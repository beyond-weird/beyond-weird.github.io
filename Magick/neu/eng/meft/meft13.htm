<P>There was an old woman, as I've heard tell,<BR>
She went to the market her eggs for to sell;<BR>
She went to the market, all on a market-day,<BR>
And she fell asleep on the king's highway.</P>
<P>There came by a pedlar, whose name was Stout,<BR>
He cut her petticoats round about;<BR>
He cut her petticoats up to the knees,<BR>
Which made the old woman to shiver and freeze.</P>
<P>When this old woman first did wake,<BR>
She began to shiver, and she began to shake;<BR>
She began to wonder, and she began to cry --<BR>
'Lawkamercyme, this is none of I!</P>
<P>'But if it bet, as I do hope it be,<BR>
I've a little dog at home, and he'll know me;<BR>
If it be I, he'll wag his little tail,<BR>
And if it be not I, he'll loudly bark and wail.'</P>
<P>Home went the little woman, all in the dark;<BR>
Up got the little dog, and he began to bark;<BR>
He began to bark, so she began to cry --<BR>
'Lawkamercyme, this is none of I !'</P>
