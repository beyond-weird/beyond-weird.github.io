<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Old Mother Wiggle-Waggle</H1>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The fox and his wife they had a great strife,<BR>
They never ate mustard in all their whole life;<BR>
They ate their meat without fork or knife <BR>
And loved to be picking a bone, e-ho!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The fox went out, one still, clear night,<BR>
And he prayed the moon to give him light,<BR>
For he'd a long way to travel that night,<BR>
Before he got back to his den-o!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The fox when he came to yonder stile,<BR>
He lifted his lugs and he listened a while!<BR>
'Oh, ho!' said the fox, 'it's but a short mile<BR>
From this unto yonder wee town, e-ho!'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;And first he arrived at a farmer's yard,<BR>
Where the ducks and geese declared it was hard,<BR>
That their nerves should be shaken and their rest should be marred<BR>
By the visits of Mister Fox-o!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The fox when he came to the farmer's gate,<BR>
Who should he see but the farmer's drake;<BR>
'I love you well for your master's sake,<BR>
And long to be picking your bones, e-ho!'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The grey goose she ran round the hay-stack,<BR>
Oh, ho!' said the fox, 'you are very fat;<BR>
You'll grease my beard and ride on my back<BR>
From this into yonder wee town, e-ho!'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Then he took the grey goose by her sleeve,<BR>
And said: 'Madam Grey Goose, by your leave<BR>
I'll take you away without reprieve,<BR>
And carry you back to my den-o!'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>And he seized the black duck by the neck,<BR>
And slung him all across his back,<BR>
The black duck cried out 'quack, quack, quack',<BR>
With his legs all dangling down-o!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Old Mother Wiggle-Waggle hopped out of bed,<BR>
Out of the window she popped her old head;<BR>
'Oh! husband, oh! husband, the grey goose is gone,<BR>
And the fox is off to his den, oh!'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Then the old man got up in his red cap,<BR>
And swore he would catch the fox in a trap;<BR>
But the fox was too cunning, and gave him the slip,<BR>
And ran through the town, the town, oh!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>When he got to the top of the hill,<BR>
He blew his trumpet both loud and shrill,<BR>
For joy that he was safe and sound<BR>
Through the town, oh!</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>But at last he arrived at his home again,<BR>
To his dear little foxes, eight, nine, ten,<BR>
Says he, 'You're in luck, here's a fine fat duck<BR>
With his legs all dangling down-o!'</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So he sat down together with his hungry wife,<BR>
And they did very well without fork or knife,<BR>
They never ate a better duck in all their life,<BR>
And the little ones picked the bones-o !</P>
