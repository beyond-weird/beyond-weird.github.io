<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HEREFORD TRACKWAYS.</H3>
<P>More than a score come through Hereford. There are sighting tumps at Hogg's Mount (Castle Green), Mouse Castle (also marked as Scots Hole), Gallows Tump (Belmont Road), Holmer Golf Links, Holmer Lane (top of old brick field), and an important one, Merryhill (in Haywood Forest), now marked as Beachwood. There also have been (now demolished) sighting tumps or points at Castle Hill, Palace Courtyard, Overbury (Aylestone Hill), The Knoll, Tupsley. And remains of one for the Castle ferry is on the line of earthwork bounding the Bishop's Meadow.</P>

<P>A riverside track sighted over Hogg's Mount and Holmer Lane Tump is illustrated in Plate VIII.</P>
<P>I have found trackways through the sites of each of the ancient churches. St. John's Street extended passes exactly through the chancel of the chapel of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem at Widemarsh. Barrol Street through the site of St. Guthlac's. In evening light a trackway can be seen from the Castle Green terrace, running through the large elm stump in the Bishop's Meadow to certain railings on the river bank, it runs by Vaga House, Quay Street, site of Blackfriars Church, northwards to Brimfield Church, and southwards through a moat this side of the rectory at Upper Bullingham. Other straight trackways are visible through an orchard behind Kilburn (Aylestone Hill), on this year's show-ground near the Three Elms, through Litley orchard, and descending the meadow on the north slope of Aylestone Hill to pass by the Burcott Pool, and on to Tenbury.</P>
