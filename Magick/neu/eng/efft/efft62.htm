<P>A LABOURING man, very shortly after his wife's death, sent to a servant girl, living at the time in a small shipping port, requesting her to come to the inn to him. The girl went, and over a "ha' pint" she agreed to accept him as her husband.</P>
<P>All went on pleasantly enough for a time. One evening the man met the girl He was silent for some time and sorrowful, but at length he told her his wife had come back.</P>
<P>"What do'st mean?" asked the girl; "have 'e seen hur?"</P>
<P>"Naw, I han't seed her,"</P>
<P>"Why, how do'st knaw it is her then?"</P>
<P>The poor man explained to her, that at night, when in bed, she would come to the side of it, and "flop" his face; and there was no mistaking her "flop."</P>
<P>"So you knawed her flop, did 'e?" asked the girl.</P>
<P>"Ay, it couldn't be mistook."</P>
<P>"If she do hunt thee," said the girl, "she'll hunt me; and if she do flop, she'll flop me,--so it must be off atween us."</P>
<P>The unfortunate flop of the dead wife prevented the man from securing a living one.</P>
