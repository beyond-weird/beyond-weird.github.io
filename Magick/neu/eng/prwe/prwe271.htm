<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE HORNS ON THE CHURCH TOWER.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;WHEN the masons were building the tower of Towednack Church,
the devil came every night and carried off the pinnacles and battlements. </p>
<P>Again and again this work was renewed during the day, and
as often was it removed during the night, until at length the builders
gave up the work in despair, feeling that it was of no use to contend with
the evil one.</p>
<P>Thus it is that Towednack Church stands lonely, with its
squat and odd-looking tower, a mark of the power of evil to the present
day. Associated with this tower is a proverb &quot;There are no cuckolds in
Towednack, because there are no horns on the church tower.&quot;</p>
