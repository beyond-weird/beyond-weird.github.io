<P ALIGN="CENTER">CORNISH TEENY-TINY</p>
<P>M. HALLIWELL gives us, in his &quot;Popular Rhymes and Nursery
Tales,&quot; the story of Teeny-tiny. In this a little old woman takes a bone
from the churchyard to make soup. She goes to bed, and puts the bone in the
cupboard. During the night some one comes demanding the bone, and at length
the terrified old woman gives it up.</p>
<P>A similar story is told in Comwall.</p>
<P>An old lady had been to the church in the sands of
Perranzabuloe. She found, amidst the numerous remains of mortality, some
very good teeth. She pocketed these, and at night placed them on her
dressing-table before getting into bed. She slept, but was at length
disturbed by some one calling out, &quot;Give me my teeth--give my teeth.&quot; At
first, the lady took no notice of this, but the cry, &quot;Give me my teeth,&quot; was
so constantly repeated, that she, at last, in terror, jumped out of bed,
took the teeth from the dressing-table, and, opening the window, flung them
out, exclaiming, &quot;Drat the teeth, take 'em.&quot; They no sooner fell into the
darkness on the road than hasty retreating footsteps were heard, and there
were no more demands for the teeth.</p>
