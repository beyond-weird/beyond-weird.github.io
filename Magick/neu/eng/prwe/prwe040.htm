RICHARD also once witnessed a fairy revel in the Towen--upon which tables
were spread, with the utmost profusion of gold and silver ornaments, and
fruits and flowers. Richard however, according to the statement of &quot; Aunt
Alcey&quot; (the name by which his wife was familiarly called), very foolishly
interrupted the feast by some exclamation of surprise; whereas, had he but
touched the end of a table with his finger, it would have been impossible for
the fairy host to have removed an article, as that which has been touched by
mortal fingers becomes to them accursed. As it was, the lovely vision faded
before the eyes of the astonished labourer.</p>
