<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE MERMAID OF SEATON.</p>
<P>NEAR Looe,--that is, between Down Derry and Looe,--there is
a little sand-beach called &quot;Seaton.&quot;</p>
<P>Tradition tells us that here once stood a goodly commercial
town bearing this name, and that when it was in its pride, Plymouth was but a
small fishing-village.</p>
<P>The town of Seaton is said to have been overwhelmed with sand
at an early period, the catastrophe having been brought about,--as in the
case of the filling up of Padstow harbour,--by the curse of a mermaid, who
had suffered some injury from the sailors who belonged to this port. Beyond
this I have been unable to glean any story worth preserving.</p>
