III --THE MAYOR OF
HALGAVER MOOR.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;The
people of Bodmin had an old custom of assembling in large numbers on
Halgaver Moor in the month of July, and electing a "Mayor of Misrule," for
the punishment of petty offenders. Our old historian gives a quaint
description. "The youthlyer sort of Bodmin townsmen use sometimes to sport
themselves by playing the box with strangers, whom they summon to
Halgaver; the name signifieth the Goats' Moore, and such a place it is,
lying a little without the town, and very full of quagmires. When these
mates meet with any raw serving-man or other young master, who may serve
and deserve to make pastime, they cause him to be solemnly arrested for
his appearance before the Mayor of Halgaver, where he is charged with
wearing, one spur, or wanting a girdle, or some such like felony, and
after he hath been arraigned and tried with all requisite circumstances,
judgment is given in formal terms, and executed in some one ungracious
prank or other, more to the scorn than hurt of the party condemned. Hence
is sprung rise proverb, when we see one slovenly apparelled, to say, 'He
shall be presented in Halgaver Court."</p>
