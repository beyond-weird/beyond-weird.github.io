<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE GIANT OF ST MICHAEL'S MOUNT LOSES HIS WIFE.</p>
<P><br>
THE giant on the Mount and the giant on Trecrobben Hill were very friendly.
They had only one cobbling-hammer between them, which they would throw from
one to the other, as either required it. One day the giant on the Mount wanted
the hammer in a great hurry, so he shouted, &quot; Holloa, up there! Trecrobben,
throw us down the hammer, woost a'?&quot;</p>
<P>&quot;To be sure,&quot; sings out Trecrobben; &quot;here! look out, and
catch 'm.&quot;</p>
<P>Now, nothing would do but the giant's wife, who was very
nearsighted, must run out of her cave to see Trecrobben throw the hammer. She
had no hat on; and coming at once out into the light, she could not 
distinguish objects. Consequently, she did not see the hammer coming through
the air, and received it between her eyes. The force with which it was flung
was so great that the massive bone of the forehead of the giantess was
crushed, and she fell dead at the giant's feet. You may be sure there was a
great to-do between the two giants. They sat wailing over the dead body, and
with their sighs they produced a tempest. These were unavailing to restore the
old lady, and all they had to do was to bury her. Some say they lifted the
Chapel Rock and put her under it, others, that she is buried beneath the
castle court, while some--no doubt the giants' detractors--declare that they
rolled the body down into the sea, and took no more heed of it.</p>
