<P ALIGN="CENTER">ST SENNEN AND ST JUST.</p>
<P>THESE saints held rule over adjoining parishes; but, like
neighbours, not unfrequently they quarrelled. We know not the cause which
made their angry passions rise; but no doubt the saints were occasionally
exposed to the influences of the evil principle, which appears to be one of
the ruling powers of the world. It is not often that we have instances of
excess of passion in man or woman without some evidence of the evil
resulting from it. Every tempest in the physical world leaves its mark on
the face of the earth. Every tempest in the moral world, in a similar
manner, leaves some scar to tell of its ravages on the soul. A most enduring
monument in granite tells us of the rage to which those two holy men were
the victims. As we have said, there is no record of the origin of the duel
which was fought between St Just and St Sennen; but, in the fury of their
rage, they tore each a rock from the granite mass, and hurled it onwards to
destroy his brother. They were so well aimed that both saints must have
perished had the rocks been allowed to travel as intended. A merciful - hand
guided them, though in opposite directions, in precisely the same path. The
huge rocks came together; so severe was the blow of impact that they became
one mass, and fell to the ground, to remain a monument of the impotent rage
of two giants.</p>
