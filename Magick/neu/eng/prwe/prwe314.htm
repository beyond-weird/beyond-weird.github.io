THE LAST WOLF IN ENGLAND</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<b>&nbsp;</b>THE extirpation of the wolves, which once existed in every part of these
islands, is an oft-told story.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;But it is not generally known
that the last native wolf lived in the forests of Ludgvan, near
Penzance. The last of his race was a gigantic specimen, and terrible was the
havoc made by him on the flocks. Tradition tells us that at last he
carried off a child. This could not be endured, so the peasantry all
turned out, and this famous wolf was captured at Rospeith, the name of
a farm still existing in Ludgvan.</p>
