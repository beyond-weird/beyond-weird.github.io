<P ALIGN="CENTER">KING ARTHUR'S STONE.</p>
<P><br>
IN the western part of Cornwall, all the marks of any peculiar kind found on
the rocks are referred either to the giants or the devil. In the eastern part
of the county such markings are almost always attributed to Arthur. Not far
from the Devil's Coit in St Columb, on the edge of the Gossmoor, there is a
large stone, upon which are deeply-impressed marks, which a little fancy may
convert into the marks of four horse-shoes. This is &quot;King Arthur's Stone,&quot; and
these marks were made by the horse upon which the British king rode when he
resided at Castle Denis, and hunted on these moors. King Arthur's beds, and
chairs, and caves, are frequently to be met with. The Giant's Coits,--and
many traditions of these will be found in the section devoted to the giant
romances--are probably monuments of the earliest types of rock mythology. Those
of Arthur belong to the period when the Britons were so far advanced in
civilisation as to war under experienced rulers; and those which are
appropriated by the devil are evidently instances of the influence of
priestcraft on the minds of an impressible people. [a]</p>
<P>[a] Another example of like stories in
Wales may be interesting --</p>
<P>&quot;Five juvenile saints, on their
pilgrimage to the celebrated shrine of St David, emaciated with hunger, and
exhausted with fatigue. here reclined themselves to rest, and reposed their
weary heads on this ponderous pillow; their eyes were soon closed by the
powerful hand of sleep, and they were no longer able to resist, by the force
of prayer, the artifices of their foes. The sky was suddenly overwhelmed
with clouds--the thunder rolled--the lightning flashed, and the lain
poured in torrents. The storm increased in vehemence; all nature became
chilled with cold, and even Piety and Charity felt its effects. The drops of
rain were soon congealed into enormous hailstones, which, by the force of
the wind, were driven with no much violence against the heads of the weary
pilgrims an to affix them to their pillow, and the vestiges they left are
still discernible. Being borne away in triumph by the malignant sorcerer who
inhabits the hollows of these hills, they
were concealed in the innermost recesses of his cavern, where they are
destined to remain asleep, bound in the irrefragable chain of enchantment
until that happy period shall arrive when the diocese shall be blessed with
a pious bishop, for when that happens, no doubt Merlin himself, the enemy of
malignant sorcerers, will be dis&#173;enchanted, and he will come and restore to
liberty the dormant saints, when they will immediately engage in the
patriotic work of reforming the Welsh."--<i>From the English Works of the
late Rev.. Eleazor Williams</i>, quoted by Warington W. Smyth, MA. Memoirs
of the Geological Survey, vol. i. p. 480.</p>
