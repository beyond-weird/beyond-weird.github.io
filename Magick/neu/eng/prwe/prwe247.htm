CURES FOR WARTS.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>
I. THE vicar of Bodmin found, not long
since, a bottle full of pins laid in a newly-made grave. I have heard of
this as an unfailing remedy; each wart was touched with a new pin, and the
pin then dropped into the bottle. I am not quite certain that it was
necessary that the bottle should be placed in a newly-made grave; in many
cases burying it in the earth, and especially at a "four cross-roads," was
quite sufficient. As the pins rust, the warts decay.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>
II. &nbsp;A piece of string should be taken,
and as many knots tied on it as there are warts on the body; each wart
being carefully touched with the knot dedicated to it. The string is then
to be buried, and the warts fade away as it decays. A few years since a
ship-wright in Devonport dockyard professed to cure warts by merely
receiving from an indifferent person a knotted string,--the knots of
which, had been tied by the afflicted. What he did with the string I know
not.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>
III.&nbsp; To touch each wart with a pebble,
place the pebbles in a bag, and to lose the bag on the way to church, was
for many years a very favourite remedy; but the unfortunate person who
found the bag received the warts. A lady once told me that she picked up
such a bag, when a child, and out of curiosity, and in ignorance, examined
the contents. The result was that she had, in a short time, as many warts
as there were stones in the bag.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>
IV. Another remedy was to <i>steal</i> a
piece of meat from a butcher's stall in the public market, and with this
to touch the warts, and bury it. As the meat putrefied the warts decayed.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;</p>
<P>V.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
remember, when quite a child, having a very large "seedy wart" on one of
my fingers. I was taken by a distant relation, an elderly lady, residing
in Gwinear, to some old woman, for the purpose of having this wart
charmed. I well remember that two charred sticks were taken from the fire
on the hearth, and carefully crossed over the fleshy excrescence, while
some words were muttered by the charmer. I know not how long it was
before the wart disappeared, but certainly, at some time, it did so.</p>
