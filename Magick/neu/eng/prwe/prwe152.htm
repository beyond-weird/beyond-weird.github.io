<P ALIGN="CENTER">RICKETY CHILDREN.</p>
<P>THE practice of bathing rickety children on the first
three, Wednesdays in May is still far from uncommon in the outlying
districts of Cornwall. The parents will walk many miles for the purpose of
dipping the little sufferers in some well, from which the &quot;healing virtue&quot;
has not entirely departed. Among these holy wells, Cubert, just named, is
far-famed. To this well the Peasantry still resort, firm in the faith that
there, at this especial Season, some mysterious virtue is communicated to
its waters. On these occasions, only a few years since, the crowd assembled
Was so large, that it assumed the character of a fair.</p>
