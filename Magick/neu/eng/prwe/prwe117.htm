<P ALIGN="CENTER">A FLYING SPIRIT.</p>
<P>ABOUT the year 1761 a pinnacle was thrown down, by
lightning, from the tower of the church at Ludgvan. The effect was then
universally imputed to the vengeance of a perturbed spirit, exorcised from
Treassow, and passing eastward, towards the usual place of banishment --THE
RED SEA.</p>
<P>The following story is given as a remarkable example of
the manner in which very recent events become connected with exceedingly old
superstitious ideas. The tales of Tregeagle have shown us how the name of a
man who lived about two centuries since is made to do duty as a demon
belonging to the pagan times. In this story we have the name of a woman who
lived about the commencement of the present century, associated with a
legend belonging to the earliest ages.</p>
