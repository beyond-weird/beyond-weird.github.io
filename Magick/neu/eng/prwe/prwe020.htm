<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE HACK AND CAST.</p>
<P><br>
IN the parish of Goran is an intrenchment running from cliff to cliff, and
cutting off about a hundred acres of coarse ground. This is about twenty feet
broad, and twenty-four feet high in most places.</p>
<P>Marvellous as it may appear, tradition assures us that this
was the work of a giant, and that he performed the task in a single night.
This fortification has long been known as <i>Thica Vosa</i>, and the Hack and
Cast.</p>
<P>The giant, who lived on the promontory, was the terror of
the neighbourhood, and great were the rejoicings in Goran when his death was
accomplished through a stratagem by a neighbouring doctor.</p>
<P>The giant fell ill through eating some food--children or
otherwise--to satisfy his voracity, which had disturbed his stomach. His
roars and groans were heard for miles, and great was the terror throughout the
neighbourhood. A messenger, however, soon arrived at the residence of the
doctor of the parish, and he bravely resolved to obey the summons of the
giant, and visit him. He found the giant rolling on the ground with pain, and
he at once determined to rid the world, if possible, of the monster.</p>
<P>He told him that he must be bled. The giant submitted, and
the doctor moreover said that, to insure relief, a large hole in the cliff
must be filled with the blood. The giant lay on the ground, his arm extended
over the hole, and the blood flowing a torrent into it. Relieved by the loss
of blood, he permitted the stream to flow on, until he at last became so weak,
that the doctor kicked him over the cliff, and killed him. The well-known
promontory of The Dead Man, or Dodman, is so called from the dead giant. The
spot on which he fell is the &quot;Giant's House,&quot; and the hole has ever since been
most favourable to the growth of ivy.</p>
