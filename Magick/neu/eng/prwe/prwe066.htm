<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE LOGAN OR LOGING ROCK. [a]</p>
<P>MODRED, in Mason's&quot; Caractacus,&quot; addressing Vellinus and
Elidurus, says--</p>
<P>&quot;Thither, youths,<br>
Turn your astonish'd eyes; behold yon huge<br>
And unhewn sphere of living adamant,<br>
Which, poised by magic, rests its central weight<br>
On yonder pointed rock: firm as it seems,<br>
Such is the strange and virtuous property,<br>
It moves obsequious to the gentlest touch<br>
Of him whose breath is pure; but to a traitor,<br>
Though even a giant's prowess nerved his arm,<br>
It stands as fixed as Snowdon.&quot;</p>
<P>This faithfully preserves the traditionary idea of the
purposes to which this in every way remarkable rock was devoted.</p>
<P>Up to the time when Lieutenant Goldsmith, on the 8th of
April 1824, slid the rock off from its support, to prove the falsehood of Dr
Borlase's statement, that &quot;it is morally impossible that any lever, or,
indeed, force, however applied in a mechanical way, can remove it from its
present position,&quot; the Logan Rock was believed to cure children, who were
rocked upon it at certain seasons, of several diseases; but the charm is
broken, although the rock is restored. [b]</p>
<P>[a] &quot;It may be observed that I have
always used the words Loging Rock for the celebrated stone at Trereen Dinas.
Much learned research seems to have been idly expended on the supposed name,
'Logan Rock.' To log is a verb in general use throughout Cornwall for vibrating
or rolling like a drunken man; and <i>an</i> is frequently heard in provincial
pronunciation for tug, characteristic of the modem present participle. The
Loging Rock is, therefore, strictly descriptive of its peculiar motlon.&quot; --
Davies Gilbert.</p>
<P>[b] When this great natural curiosity
was, as it was thought, destroyed, the public wrath was excited, and appeased
only' by the conciliatory spirit manifested by Mr Davies Gilbert, who persuaded
the Lords of the Admiralty to lend Lieutenant Goldsmith the required apparatus
for replacing it. Mr D. Gilbert found the money; and after making the necessary
arrangements, on the ad of November 1824, Goldsmith &quot;had the glory of replacing
this immense rock in its natural position.&quot; The glory of Goldsmith and of
Shrubsall, who overturned another large Logan Rock, is certainly one not to be
desired.</p>
