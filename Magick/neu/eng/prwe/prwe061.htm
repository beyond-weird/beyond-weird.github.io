<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE MERMAID'S ROCK.</p>
<P>To the westward of the beautiful Cove of Lemorna is a rock
which has through all time borne the above name. I have never been enabled to
learn any special story in connection with this rock. There exists the popular
fancy of a lady showing herself here previous to a storm--with, of course,
the invariable comb and glass. She is said to have been heard singing most
plaintively before a wreck, and that, all along the shore, the spirits have
echoed her in low moaning voices. [a] Young men are said to have swam off to
the rock, lured by the songs which they heard, but they have never returned.
Have we not in this a dim shadow of the story of the Sirens?</p>
<P>[a] The undulations of the air, travelling with more rapidity
than the currents, reach our shores long before the tempest by which they have
been established in the centre of the Atlantic, and by producing a low moaning
sound, &quot;the soughing of the wind,&quot; predicates the storms. The &quot;moans of
Tregeagle&quot; is another expression indicating the same phenomenon.</p>
