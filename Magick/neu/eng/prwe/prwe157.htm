<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PRESERVATION OF HOLY WELLS.</p>
<P>IT is a very common notion amongst the peasantry, that a
retribution overtakes those who wilfully destroy monuments such as stone
circles, crosses, wells, and the like. Mr Blight writes me--&quot;Whilst at
Boscaswell, in St Just, a few weeks since, an old man told me that a person
who altered an old Holy Well there, was drowned the next day in sight of his
home, and that a person who carried away the stones of an ancient chapel,
had his house burned down that very night.&quot; We hope the certainty of
punishment will prevent any further spoliation. Cannot we do something
towards the preservation of our antiquities ? I quote from a local paper the
following -</p>
<P>&quot;If the attention of the members of the Penzance
Antiquarian Society were directed to the state of the 'Holy Well' at
Laneast, and the remains of the Old Chapel Park, St Clether, they might
perhaps induce the proprietors of these 'remnants of antiquity' to bestow a
little care on the same, and arrest their further ruin and destruction. Many
other 'objects of interest' are in a sad state of neglect, and fast 'fading
away.' Slaughtor Bridge, near Camelford, has completely vanished. This is
much to be regretted, and is a double loss--first, to those who delight in
these 'memorials of the past,' and also to the town and neighbourhood,
depriving them of an attraction that has induced many strangers of taste to
pay them a visit.&quot;</p>
