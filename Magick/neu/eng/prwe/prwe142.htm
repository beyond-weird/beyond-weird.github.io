<P ALIGN="CENTER">THEODORE, KING OF CORNWALL</p>
<P>
&nbsp;RIVIERE, near Hayle, now called
Rovier, was the palace of Theodore, the king, to whom Cornwall appears to have
been indebted for many of its saints. This Christian king, when the pagan
people sought to destroy the first missionaries, gave the saints shelter in
his palace, St Breca, St Iva, St Burianna, and many others, are said to have
made Riviere their residence. It is not a little curious to find traditions
existing, as it were, in a state of suspension between opinions. I have heard
it said that there was a church at Rovier--that there was once a great palace
there; and again, that Castle Cayle was one vast fortified place, and Rovier
another. Mr Davies Gilbert quotes Whitaker on this point -</p>
<P>&quot;Mr Whitaker, who captivates every reader by the brilliancy
of his style, and astonishes by the extent of his multifarious reading, draws,
however, without reserve, on his fertile imagination, for whatever facts may
be requisite to construct the fabfic of a theory. He has made Riviere the
palace and residence of Theodore, a sovereign prince of Cornwall, and conducts
St Breca, St Ira, with several companions, not only into Hayle and to this
palace, after their voyage from Ireland, but fixes the time of their arrival
so exactly, as to make it take place in the night. In recent times thi name of
Riviere, which had been lost in the common pronunciation, Rovier, has revived
in a very excellent house built by Mr Edwards on the farm, which he completed
in 1791.&quot; [a]</p>
