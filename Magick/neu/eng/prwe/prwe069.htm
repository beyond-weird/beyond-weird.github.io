<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE MEN-AN-TOL</p>
<P><br>
NOT more than two miles from Penzance stands the celebrated cromlech of Lanyon
-- often pronounced Lanine. This, like all the other cromlechs, marks, no
doubt, the resting-place of a British chieftain, many of whose followers
repose within a short</p>
<P>distance of this, the principal monument.</p>
<P>Beyond the village of Lanyon, on a &quot;furzy down,&quot; stands the
M&#234;n-an-tol, or the &quot;holed stone.&quot; For some purpose--it is in vain to speculate
on it now--the bardic priesthood employed this stone, and probably the
superstition which attaches to it may indicate its ancient uses.</p>
<P>If scrofulous children are passed naked through the
Men-an-tol three times, and then drawn on the grass three times against the
sun, it is felt by the faithful that much has been done towards insuring a
speedy cure. Even men and women who have been afflicted with spinal diseases,
or who have suffered from scrofulous taint, have been drawn through this magic
stone, which all declare still retains its ancient virtues.</p>
<P>If two brass pins are carefully laid across each other on
the top edge of this stone, any question put to the rock will be answered, by
the pins acquiring, through some unknown agency, a peculiar motion.</p>
