<P ALIGN="CENTER">PROBUS AND GRACE.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;EVERY one is acquainted with the
beautiful tower of Probus' Church. If they are not, they should lose no time
in visiting it. Various are the stories in connection with those two saints,
who are curiously connected with the church, and one of the fairs held in the
Church-town. A safe tradition tells us that St Probus built the church, and
failing in the means of adding a tower to his building, he petitioned St Grace
to aid him. Grace was a wealthy lady, and she resolved at her own cost to
build a tower, the like of which should not be seen in the &quot;West Countrie.&quot;
Regardless of the expense, sculptured stone was worked by the most skilful
masons, and the whole put together in the happiest of proportions. When the
tower was finished, St Probus opened his church with every becoming solemnity,
and took to himself all the praise which was lavished on the tower, although
he had built only a plain church. When, however, the praise of Probus was at
the highest, a Voice was heard slowly and distinctly exclaiming,</p>
<P>&quot;Saint Probus and Grace,<br>
Not the first, but the last;&quot;</p>
<P>and thus for ever have Probus and Grace been united as
patron saints of this church.</p>
<P>Mr Davies Gilbert remarks, however, in his &quot;Parochial
History:&quot; &quot;Few gentlemen's houses in the west of Cornwall were without the
honour of receiving Prince Charles during his residence in the county about
the middle part of the civil wars; and he is said to have remained for a time
longer than usual with Mr Williams, who, after the Restoration, waited on the
king with congratulations from the parish; and, on being complimented by him
with the question whether he could do anything for his friends, answered that
the parish would esteem themselves highly honoured and distinguished by the
grant of a fair, which was accordingly done for the 17th of September. This
fair coming the last in succession after three others, has acquired for itself
a curious appellation, derived from the two patron saints, and from the
peculiar pronunciation in that neighbourhood of the word 'last,' somewhat like
latest,-- </p>
<P>'Saint Probus and Grace,<br>
Not the first, but the last,'-- </p>
<P>and from this distinction it is usually called Probus and
Grace Fair.&quot; We are obliged, therefore, to lean on the original tradition for
the true meaning of this couplet.</p>
