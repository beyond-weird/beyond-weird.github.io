<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;BY HOOK OR BY CROOK.&quot;</p>
<P>IN the parish of Egles-Hayle are two crosses, known as &quot;Peverell's
Crosses;&quot; and near Mount Charles, also in this parish, is another &quot;moorstone&quot;
cross, called the Prior's Cross, whereon is cut the figure of a hook and a
crook, in memory of the privileges granted by a prior, belonging to the family
of the Peverells, who are said to have possessed lands in this parish since
the time of Richard II.</p>
<P>The poor of Bodmin were greatly distressed through the
scarcity of fuel, the &quot;turf&quot; or peat of the moors, being insufficient to
supply their wants. The prior gave &quot;privilege and freedom&quot; to the poor of
Bodmin for gathering, for &quot;fire-boote and house-boote,&quot; such boughs and
branches of oak-trees in his woods at Dunmear, as they could reach to, or come
at, with a &quot;hook and a crook,&quot; without further damage to the trees.</p>
<P>Hence the proverb concerning filching, &quot;that they will have it
by hook or by crook.&quot;</p>
