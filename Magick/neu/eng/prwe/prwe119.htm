<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE LUGGER OF CROFT PASCO POOL</p>
<P>IN the midst of the dreary waste of Gornhilly, which
occupies a large portion of the Lizard promontory, is a large piece of water
known as &quot;Croft Pasco Pool,&quot; where it is said at night the form of a ghostly
vessel may be seen floating with lug-sails spread. A more dreary, weird spot
could hardly be selected for a witches' meeting; and the Lizard folks were
always--a fact--careful to be back before dark, preferring to suffer
inconvenience, to risking a sight of the ghostly lugger. Unbelieving people
attributed the origin of the tradition to a white horse seen in a dim
twilight standing in the shallow water; but this was indignantly rejected by
the mass of the residents.</p>
