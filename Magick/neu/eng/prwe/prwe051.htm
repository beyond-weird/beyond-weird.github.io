<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE PISKIE THRESHERS.</p>
<P><br>
MANY an industrious farmer can speak of the assistance which he has received
from the piskies. Mr T. Q. Couch tells a story of this kind so well that no
other is required. [a] Long, long ago, before threshing-machines were thought
of, the farmer who resided at C --, in going to his barn one day, was surprised
at the extraordinary quantity of corn that had been threshed the previous
night, as well as to discover the mysterious agency by which it was effected.
His curiosity led him to inquire into the matter; so at night, when the moon
was up, he crept stealthily to the barn door, and looking through a chink, saw
a little fellow, clad in a tattered suit of green, wielding the &quot;dreshel&quot;
(flail) with astonishing vigour, and beating the floor with blows so rapid
that the eye could not follow the motion of the implement. The farmer slunk
away unperceived, and went to bed, where he lay a long while awake, thinking
in what way he could best show his gratitude to the piskie for such an
important service. He came to the conclusion at length, that, as the little
fellow's clothes were getting very old and ragged, the gift of a new suit
would be a proper way to lessen the obligation; and, accordingly, on the
morrow he had a suit of green made, of what was supposed to be the proper
size, which he carried early in the evening to the barn, and left for the
piskie's acceptance. At night the farmer stole to the door again to see how
the gift was taken. He was just in time to see the elf put on the suit, which
was no sooner accomplished than, looking down on himself admiringly, he sung --</p>
<P>&quot;Piskie fine, and piskie gay,<br>
Piskie now will fly away.&quot;</p>
