<P ALIGN="CENTER">HOW MR LENINE GAVE UP COURTING.</p>
<P>MR LENINE had been, as was his wont, spending his evening
hours with the lady of his love. He was a timid man and always returned to
Tregenebris early. Beyond this, as the lady was alone, she deemed it prudent
to let the world know that Mr Lenine left her by daylight.</p>
<P>One evening, it was scarcely yet dark, and our lover was
re turning home through Leah Lanes. His horse started at an an woman, who
had crept under the hedge for shelter from a passing shower. As Mr Lenine
saw a figure moving in the shade he was terrified.</p>
<P>&quot;Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho,&quot; sang an owl.</p>
<P>&quot;It's only me--Mr Lenine of Tregenebris,&quot; said he,
putting the spurs to his horse.</p>
<P>Something followed him, fast as he might go, and he force
his horse up the hill by Leak vean.</p>
<P>&quot;Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho,&quot; sang the owl.</p>
<P>&quot;It 's only me--Aunt Betty Foss,&quot; screamed the old
woman.</p>
<P>&quot;Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho, ho,&quot; sang the owl again.</p>
<P>&quot;Don't ye be afeared, Mr Lenine,&quot; shrieked Aunt Betty,
almost out of breath.</p>
<P>&quot;Tu-whit, tu-whoo, ho, ho, ho,&quot; also shrieked the owl.</p>
<P>&quot;Oh, it 's only John Lenine of Tregenebris,&quot; stammered
the frightened lover, who had, however, reached home.</p>
<P>He went no more a-courting. He was fully persuaded that
either a highwayman and his crew, or the devil and his imps, were upon him.
He died a bachelor, and the charming lady became a peevish old maid, and
died in solitude; all owing to the hooting owl.</p>
<P>Some do say Betty Foss was a witch, and the owl her
familiar.</p>
