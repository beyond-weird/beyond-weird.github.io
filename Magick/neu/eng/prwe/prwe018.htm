<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE GIANT OF MORVA [a]</p>
<P><br>
IN the Giant's Field in Morva still stand some granite fragments which once
constituted the Giant's House. From this we see the Giant's Castle at
Bosprenis, and the Giant's Cradle, thus perpetuating the infancy of the great
man, and his subsequent power. The quoits used by this giant are numerous
indeed. This great man, on the 1st day of August, would walk up to Bosprenis
Croft, and there perform some magical rites, which were either never known, or
they have 'been forgotten. On this day,--for when thus engaged the giant was
harmless,--thousands of people would congregate to get a glimpse of the
monster; and as he passed them,--all being seated on the stone hedges, --
every one drank &quot;to the health of Mr Giant.&quot; At length the giant died, but the
gathering on the 1st of August has never been given up, or rather, the day
shifts, and is made to agree with Morva Feast, which is held on the first
Sunday in August.</p>
<P>A Morva farmer writes:-- &quot;A quarter of an acre would not
hold the horses ridden to the fair,--the hedges being covered by the
visitors, who drink and carouse as in former times. Morva Fair is, however,
dying out.&quot;</p>
<P>The parish-clerk informed me that the giant had twenty
sons; that he was the first settler in these parts; and that he planted his
children all round the coast. It was his custom to bring all his family
together on the 1st of August, and hence the origin of the fair. Whichever may
be the true account of the cause which established the fair and the feast,
these romances clearly establish the fact that the giants were at the bottom
of it.</p>
<P>[a] The above notices were collected for me in Morva by
the late C. Taylor Stephens, author of &quot;The Chief of Barat-Anac,&quot; and &quot;some
time rural postman front St Ives to Zennor.&quot; Their connection with the
traditions of Jack and Tom will be evident to every reader.</p>
