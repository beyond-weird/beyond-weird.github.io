<P><br>
NINE &quot;Moor Stones&quot; are set up near the road in the parish of Gwendnon, or
Wendron, to which the above name is given. The perpendicular blocks of granite
have evidently been placed with much labour in their present position.
Tradition says they indicate the graves of nine sisters. Hals appears to think
some nuns were buried here. From one person only I heard the old stony of the
stones having been metamorphosed maidens. Other groups of stone might be
named, as Rosemedery, Tregaseal, Boskednan, Botallack, Tredinek, and Crowlas,
in the west, to which the same story extends, and many others in the eastern
parts of the county; but it cannot be necessary.</p>
