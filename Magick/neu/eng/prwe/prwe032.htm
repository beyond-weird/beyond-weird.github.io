<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE FAIRY MINERS--THE KNOCKERS.</p>
<P><br>
AT Ransom Mine the &quot;Knockers&quot; were always very active in their subterranean
operations. In every part of the mine their &quot;knockings&quot; were heard, but most
especially were they busy in one particular &quot;end.&quot; There was a general
impression that great wealth must exist at this part of the &quot;lode.&quot; Yet,
notwithstanding the inducements of very high &quot;tribute&quot; were held out to the
miners, no pair of men could be found brave enough to venture on the ground of
the &quot;Bockles.&quot; An old man and his son, called Trenwith, who lived near
Bosprenis, went out one midsummer eve, about midnight, and watched until they
saw the &quot;Smae People&quot; bringing up the shining ore. It is said they were
possessed of some secret by which they could communicate with the fairy
people. Be this as it may, they told the little miners that they would save
them all the trouble of breaking down the ore, that they would bring &quot;to
grass&quot; for them, one-tenth of the &quot;richest stuff,&quot; and leave it properly
dressed, if they would quietly give them up this end. An agreement of some
kind was come to. The old man and his son took the &quot;pitch,&quot; and in a short
time realised much wealth. The old man never failed to keep to his bargain,
and leave the tenth of the ore for his friends. He died. The son was
avaricious and selfish. He sought to cheat the Knockers, but he ruined himself
by so doing. The &quot;lode&quot; failed; nothing answered with him; disappointed, he
took to drink, squandered all the money his father had made, and died a
beggar.</p>
