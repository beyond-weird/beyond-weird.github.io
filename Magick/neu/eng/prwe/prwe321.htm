<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE LIZARD PEOPLE</p>
<P>THERE is a tradition that the Lizard people were formerly
a very inferior race. In fact it is said that they went on all fours, till
the crew of a foreign vessel, wrecked on the coast, settled among them, and
improved the race so much that they became as remarkable for their stature
and physical development as they had been before for the reverse. At this
time, as a whole, the Lizard folks certainly have among them a very large
population of tall people, many of the men and women being over six feet in
height.</p>
