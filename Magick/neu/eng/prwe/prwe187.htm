<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE SAILOR WIZARD.</p>
<P>THIS appears to have been, and it may still be, a very
common superstition. I have lately received from Mr T. Q. Couch of Bodmin
the story of some sailors, who had reason to suspect that one of their body
was a wizard. This was eventually proved to have been the case, by
circumstances in every way resembling those of our old witch. There had been
a quarrel, and revenge had been talked of. The sailors were all grouped
together in the forepart of the ship, except the suspected one, and a toad
fell sprawling amongst them. One of the men flung the creature into the fire
in the caboose. It struggled for a moment in the fire, and then by a
convulsive effort flung itself out. Immediately the toad was caught up by
one of the men, and flung into the sea.</p>
<P>In the course of some little time the absent sailor made his
appearance dripping wet. In a drunken frolic he had first fallen into the
fire at a low beer shop or &quot;Kiddle-e-wink,&quot; and subsequently he fell out of
the boat into the sea.</p>
