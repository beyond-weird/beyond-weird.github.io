<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE COCK-CROW STONE.</p>
<P><br>
A ROCK of white marble (?) with many rock basins on its surface lies in Looe
harbour, under Saunder's Lane, and is now -covered by every tide. This stone
once stood on the top of an elevated rock near it, and when in this position,
whenever it heard a cock crow in the neighbouring farmyard of Hay, it turned
round three times.</p>
<P>The topmost stone of that curious pile of rocks in the parish
of St Cleer known as the Cheesewring is gifted in like manner. Even now the
poultry-yards are very distant, but in ancient days the cocks must have crowed
most lustily, to have produced vibrations on either the sensitive rock or the
tympanum of man.</p>
