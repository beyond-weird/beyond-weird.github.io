<P ALIGN="CENTER">THE SISTERS OF GLEN-NEOT</p>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">by THE LATE REV. R. S. HAWKER OF MORWENSTOW.</p>
<P>IT IS from
Neot's sainted steep</p>
<P>The foamy waters
flash and leap;</p>
<P>It is where
shrieking wildflowers grow,</p>
<P>They lave the
nymph that dwells below !</p>
<P>But wherefore in
this far-off dell, </p>
<P>The reliques of
a human cell ?</p>
<P>Where the sad
stream and lonely wind</p>
<P>Bring Man no
tidings of their kind !</p>
<P>Long years agone
! the otd man said,</p>
<P>'Twas told him
by his grandsire dead,</p>
<P>One day two
ancient sisters came,</p>
<P>None there could
tell their race or name.</p>
<P>Their speech was
not in Cornish phrase,</p>
<P>Their garb had
marks of loftier days;</p>
<P>Slight food they
took from hands of men,</p>
<P>They wither'd
slowly in that glen.</p>
<P>One died ! the
other's shrunken eye</p>
<P>Gush'd till the
fount of tears was dry;</p>
<P>A wild and
wasting thought had she --</p>
<P>&quot;I shall have
none to weep for me !&quot;</p>
<P>They found her
silent at the last,</p>
<P>Bent in the
shape wherein she pass'd --</p>
<P>Where her lone
seat long used to stand,</p>
<P>Her head upon
her shrivell'd hand !</p>
<P>Did fancy give
this legend birth ?</p>
<P>The grandame's
tale for winter-hearth,</p>
<P>Or some dead
bark, by Neot's stream</p>
<P>People these
banks with such a dream ?</p>
<P>We know not !
but it suits the scene,</p>
<P>To think such
wild things here have been;</p>
<P>What spot more
meet could grief or sin</p>
<P>Choose at the
last to wither in ?</p>
