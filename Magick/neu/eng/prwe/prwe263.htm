<P ALIGN="CENTER">LIGHTS SEEN BY THE CONVERTED.</p>
<P>
&nbsp;THERE is, in many parts of the county, a belief, derived no
doubt from the recollection of St Paul's conversion, that, when sinners
are converted, they see shining lights about themselves. I have many times
heard this, but every one seems to have his own particular mode of
describing the phenomenon,--where they can be prevailed on to describe it
at all,--and usually that is derived from some picture which has made an
impression on their minds such as, &quot;exactly like the light shining round
the angel appearing to St Peter, in fayther's Bible.&quot;</p>
