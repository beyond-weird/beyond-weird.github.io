<PRE>

248A.1	 &#145;O SAW ye my father? or saw ye my mother?
	 Or saw ye my true-love John?&#146;
	 &#145;I saw not your father, I saw not your mother,
	 But I saw your true-love John.
248A.2	 &#145;It&#146;s now ten at night, and the stars gie nae light,
	 And the bells they ring ding, dang;
	 He&#146;s met wi some delay that causeth him to stay,
	 But he will be here ere lang.&#146;
248A.3	 The surly auld earl did naething but snarl,
	 And Johny&#146;s face it grew red;
	 Yet, tho he often sighd, he neer a word replied
	 Till all were asleep in bed.
248A.4	 Up Johny rose, and to the door he goes,
	 And gently tirl d the pin;
	 The lassie taking tent unto the door she went,
	 And she opend and let him in.
248A.5	 &#145;And are ye come at last? and do I hold ye fast?
	 And is my Johny true?&#146;
	 &#145;I hae nae time to tell, but sae lang&#146;s I like mysell
	 Sae lang will I love you.&#146;
248A.6	 &#145;Flee, flee up, my bonny grey cock,
	 And craw when it is day;
	 Your neck shall be like the bonny beaten gold,
	 And your wings of the silver grey.&#146;
248A.7	 The cock prov&#146;d false, and untrue he was,
	 For he crew an hour oer soon;
	 The lassie thought it was day when she sent her love away,
	 And it was but a blink of the moon.
