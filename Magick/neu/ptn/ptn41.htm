<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Gertrude's Bird</H1>
<P>In those days when our Lord and St. Peter wandered upon earth, they came once to an old wife's house, who sat baking. Her name was Gertrude, and she had a red mutch on her head. They had walked a long way, and were both hungry, and our Lord begged hard for a bannock to stay their hunger. Yes, they should have it. <A NAME="page_214"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 214</FONT></A> So she took a tiny little piece of dough and rolled it out, but as she rolled it, it grew and grew till it covered the whole griddle.</P>
<P>Nay, that was too big; they couldn't have that. So she took a tinier bit still; but when that was rolled out it covered the whole griddle just the same, and that bannock was too big, she said; they couldn't have that either.</P>
<P>The third time she took a still tinier bit--so tiny you could scarce see it; but it was the same story over again--the bannock was too big.</P>
<P>"Well," said Gertrude, "I can't give you anything; you must just go without, for all these bannocks are too big."</P>
<P>Then our Lord waxed wroth, and said,--</P>
<P>"Since you love me so little as to grudge me a morsel of food, you shall have this punishment,--you shall become a bird, and seek your food between bark and bole, and never get a drop to drink save when it rains."</P>
<P>He had scarce said the last word before she was turned into a great black woodpecker, or Gertrude's bird, and flew from her kneading-trough right up the chimney; and till this very day you may see her flying about, with her red mutch on her head, and her body all black, because of the soot in the chimney; and so she hacks and taps away at the trees for her food, and whistles when rain is coming, for she is ever athirst, and then she looks for a drop to cool her tongue.</P>
