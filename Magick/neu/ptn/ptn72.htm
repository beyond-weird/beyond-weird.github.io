<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">WHY THE JACK-SPANIARD'S WAIST IS SMALL</H3>
<P>ANANZI and Mosquito were talking together one day, and boasting of their fathers' crops. Ananzi said his father had never had such a crop in his life before; and Mosquito said, he was sure his father's was bigger, for one yam they dug was as big as his leg. This tickled Jack-Spaniard so much, that he laughed till he broke his waist in two. That's why the Jack-Spaniard's waist is so small.</P>
