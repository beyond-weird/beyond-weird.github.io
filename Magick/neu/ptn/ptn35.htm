<P>A sportsman went out once into a wood to shoot, and he met a Snipe.</P>
<P>"Dear friend," said the Snipe, "don't shoot my children?"</P>
<P>"How shall I know your children?" asked the Sports-man; "what are they like?"</P>
<P>"Oh!" said the Snipe, "mine are the prettiest children in all the wood."</P>
<P>"Very well," said the Sportsman, "I'll not shoot them; don't be afraid."</P>
<P>But for all that, when he came back, there he had a whole string of young snipes in his hand which he had shot.</P>
<P>"Oh! oh!" said the Snipe, "why did you shoot my children after all?"</P>
<P>"What, these your children!" said the Sportsman; "why, I shot the ugliest I could find, that I did!"</P>
<P>"Woe is me!" said the Snipe; "don't you know that each one thinks his own children the prettiest in the world?"</P>
