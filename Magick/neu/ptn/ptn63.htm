<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Lad and the Deil</H1>
<P>Once on a time there was a lad who was walking along a road cracking nuts, so he found one that was worm-eaten, and just at that very moment he met the Deil.</P>
<P>"Is it true, now," said the lad, "what they say, that the Deil can make himself as small as he chooses, and thrust himself in through a pinhole?"</P>
<P>"Yes, it is," said the Deil.</P>
<P>"Oh! it is, is it? then let me see you do it, and just creep into this nut," said the lad.</P>
<P>So the Deil did it.</P>
<P>Now, when he had crept well into it through the worm's hole, the lad stopped it up with a pin.</P>
<P>"Now, I've got you safe," he said, and put the nut into his pocket.</P>
<P>So when he had walked on a bit, he came to a smithy, and he turned in and asked the smith if he'd be good enough to crack that nut for him.</P>
<P>"Ay, that'll be an easy job," said the smith, and took his smallest hammer, laid the nut on the anvil, and gave it a blow, but it wouldn't break.</P>
<P>So he took another hammer a little bigger, but that wasn't heavy enough either.</P>
<P>Then he took one bigger still, but it was still the same story; and so the smith got wroth, and grasped his great sledge-hammer.</P>
<P>"Now, I'll crack you to bits," he said, and let drive at <A NAME="page_378"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 378</FONT></A> the nut with all his might and main. And so the nut flew to pieces with a bang that blew off half the roof of the smithy, and the whole house creaked and groaned as though it were ready to fall.</P>
<P>"Why! if I don't think the Deil must have been in that nut," said the smith.</P>
<P>"So he was; you're quite right," said the lad, as he went away laughing.</P>
