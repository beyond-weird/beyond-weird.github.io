<p>30. Beyond these dwell the Catti, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_166"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">166</FONT></A> whose settlements, beginning from the Hercynian forest, are in a tract of country less open and marshy than those which overspread the other states of Germany; for it consists of a continued range of hills, which gradually become more scattered; and the Hercynian forest &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_167"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">167</FONT></A> both accompanies and leaves behind, its Catti. This nation is distinguished by hardier frames, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_168"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">168</FONT></A> compactness of limb, fierceness of countenance, and superior vigor of mind. For Germans, they have a considerable share of understanding and sagacity; they choose able persons to command, and obey them when chosen; keep their ranks; seize opportunities; restrain impetuous motions; distribute properly the business of the day; intrench themselves against the night; account fortune dubious, and valor only certain; and, what is extremely rare, and only a consequence of discipline, depend more upon the general than the army. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_169"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">169</FONT></A> Their force consists entirely in infantry; who, besides their arms, are obliged to carry tools and provisions. Other nations appear to go to a battle; the Catti, to war. Excursions and casual encounters are rare amongst them. It is, indeed, peculiar to cavalry soon to obtain, and soon to yield, the victory. Speed borders upon timidity; slow movements are more akin to steady valor.</p>
