<p>5. The land, though varied to a considerable extent in its aspect, is yet universally shagged with forests, or deformed by marshes: moister on the side of Gaul, more bleak on the side of Norieum and Pannonia. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_32"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">32</FONT></A> It is productive of grain, but unkindly to fruit-trees. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_33"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">33</FONT></A> It abounds in flocks and herds, but in general of a small breed. Even the beeve kind are destitute of their usual stateliness and dignity of head: &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_34"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">34</FONT></A> they are, however, numerous, and form the most esteemed, and, indeed, the only species of wealth. Silver and gold the gods, I know not whether in their favor or anger, have denied to this country. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_35"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">35</FONT></A> Not that I would assert that no veins of these metals are generated in Germany; for who has made the search? The possession of them is not coveted by these people as it is by us. Vessels of silver are indeed to be seen among them, which have been presented to their ambassadors and chiefs; but they are held in no higher estimation than earthenware. The borderers, however, set a value on gold and silver for the purpose of commerce, and have learned to distinguish several kinds of our coin, some of which they prefer to others: the remoter inhabitants continue the more simple and ancient usage of bartering commodities. The money preferred by the Germans is the old and well-known species, such as the <i>Serrati</i> and <i>Bigati</i>. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_36"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">36</FONT></A> They are also better pleased with silver than gold; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_37"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">37</FONT></A> not on account of any fondness for that metal, but because the smaller money is more convenient in their common and petty merchandise.</p>
