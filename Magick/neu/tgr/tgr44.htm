<p>44. Next occur the communities of the Suiones, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_244"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">244</FONT></A> seated in the very Ocean, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_245"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">245</FONT></A> who, besides their strength in men and arms, also possess a naval force. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_246"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">246</FONT></A> The form of their vessels differs from ours in having a prow at each end, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_247"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">247</FONT></A> so that they are always ready to advance. They make no use of sails, nor have regular benches of oars at the sides: they row, as is practised in some rivers, without order, sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, as occasion requires. These people honor wealth; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_248"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">248</FONT></A> for which reason they are subject to monarchical government, without any limitations, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_249"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">249</FONT></A> or precarious conditions of allegiance. Nor are arms allowed to be kept promiscuously, as among the other German nations: but are committed to the charge of a keeper, and he, too, a slave. The pretext is, that the Ocean defends them from any sudden incursions; and men unemployed, with arms in their hands, readily become licentious. In fact, it is for the king's interest not to entrust a noble, a freeman, or even an emancipated slave, with the custody of arms.</p>
