<p><A NAME="xref_1"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">1</FONT></A> This treatise was written in the year of Rome 851, A.D. 98; during the fourth consulate of the emperor Nerva, and the third of Trajan.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_2"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">2</FONT></A> The Germany here meant is that beyond the Rhine. The Germania Cisrhenana, divided into the Upper and Lower, was a part of Gallia Belgica.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_3"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">3</FONT></A> Rhaetia comprehended the country of the Grisons, with part of Suabia and Bavaria.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_4"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">4</FONT></A> Lower Hungary, and part of Austria.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_5"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">5</FONT></A> The Carpathian mountains in Upper Hungary.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_6"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">6</FONT></A> "Broad promontories." Latos sinus. Sinus strictly signifies "a bending," especially inwards. Hence it is applied to a gulf, or bay, of the sea. And hence, again, by metonymy, to that projecting part of the land, whereby the gulf is formed; and still further to any promontory or peninsula. It is in this latter force it is here used;--and refers especially to the Danish peninsula. See Livy xxvii, 30, xxxviii. 5; Servius on Virgil, Aen. xi. 626.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_7"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">7</FONT></A> Scandinavia and Finland, of which the Romans had a very slight knowledge, were supposed to be islands.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_8"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">8</FONT></A> The mountains of the Grisons. That in which the Rhine rises is at present called Vogelberg.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_9"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">9</FONT></A> Now called Schwartzwald, or the Black Forest. The name Danubius was given to that portion of the river which is included between its source and Vindobona (Vienna); throughout the rest of its course it was called Ister.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_10"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">10</FONT></A> <i>Donec erumpat</i>. The term <i>erumpat</i> is most correctly and graphically employed; for the Danube discharges its waters into the Euxine with so great force, that its course may be distinctly traced for miles out to sea.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_11"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">11</FONT></A> There are now but five.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_12"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">12</FONT></A> The ancient writers called all nations <i>indigenae</i> (<i>i.e.</i> inde geniti), or <i>autochthones</i>, "sprung from the soil," of whose origin they were ignorant.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_13"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">13</FONT></A> It is, however, well established that the ancestors of the Germans migrated by land from Asia. Tacitus here falls into a very common kind of error, in assuming a local fact (viz. the manner in which migrations took place in the basin of the Mediterranean) to be the expression of a general law.--ED.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_14"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">14</FONT></A> Drusus, father of the emperor Claudius, was the first Roman general who navigated the German Ocean. The difficulties and dangers which Germanicus met with from the storms of this sea are related in the Annals, ii. 23.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_15"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">15</FONT></A> All barbarous nations, in all ages, have applied verse to the same use, as is still found to be the case among the North American Indians. Charlemagne, as we are told by Eginhart, "wrote out and committed to memory barbarous verses of great antiquity, in which the actions and wars of ancient kings were recorded."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_16"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">16</FONT></A> The learned Leibnitz supposes this Tuisto to have been the Teut or Teutates so famous throughout Gaul and Spain, who was a Celto-Scythian king or hero, and subdued and civilized a great part of Europe and Asia. Various other conjectures have been formed concerning him and his son Mannus, but most of them extremely vague and improbable. Among the rest, it has been thought that in Mannus and his three sons an obscure tradition is preserved of Adam, and his sons Cain, Abel, and Seth; or of Noah, and his sons Shem, Ham, and Japhet.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_17"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">17</FONT></A> Conringius interprets the names of the sons of Mannus into Ing&auml;ff, Ist&auml;f, and Hermin.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_18"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">18</FONT></A> Pliny, iv. 14, embraces a middle opinion between these, and mentions five capital tribes. The Vindili, to whom belong the Burgundiones, Varini, Carini, and Guttones; the Ingaevones, including the Cimbri, Teutoni, and Chauci; the Istaevones, near the Rhine, part of whom are the midland Cimbri; the Hermiones, containing the Suevi, Hermunduri, Catti, and Cherusci; and the Peucini and Bastarnae, bordering upon the Dacians.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_19"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">19</FONT></A> The Marsi appear to have occupied various portions of the northwest part of Germany at various times. In the time of Tiberius (A.D. 14) they sustained a great slaughter from the forces of Germanicus, who ravaged their country for fifty miles with fire and sword, sparing neither age nor sex, neither things profane nor sacred. (See Ann. i. 51.) At this period they were occupying the country in the neighborhood of the Rura (Ruhr), a tributary of the Rhine. Probably this slaughter was the destruction of them as a separate people; and by the time that Trajan succeeded to the imperial power they seem to have been blotted out from amongst the Germanic tribes. Hence their name will not be found in the following account of Germany.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_20"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">20</FONT></A> These people are mentioned by Strabo, vii. 1, 3. Their locality is not very easy to determine.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_21"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">21</FONT></A> See note, c. 38.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_22"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">22</FONT></A> The Vandals are said to have derived their name from the German word <i>wendeln</i>, "to wander." They began to be troublesome to the Romans A.D. 160, in the reigns of Aurelius and Verus. In A.D. 410 they made themselves masters of Spain in conjunction with the Alans and Suevi, and received for their share what from them was termed Vandalusia (Andalusia). In A.D. 429 they crossed into Africa under Genseric, who not only made himself master of Byzacium, Gaetulia, and part of Numidia, but also crossed over into Italy, A.D. 455, and plundered Rome. After the death of Genseric the Vandal power declined.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_23"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">23</FONT></A> That is, those of the Marsi, Gambrivii, etc. Those of Ingaevones, Istaevones, and Hermiones, were not so much names of the people, as terms expressing their situation. For, according to the most learned Germans, the Ingaevones are <i>die Inwohner</i>, those dwelling inwards, towards the sea; the Istaevones, <i>die Westwohner</i>, the inhabitants of the western parts: and the Hermiones, <i>die Herumwohner</i>, the midland inhabitants.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_24"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">24</FONT></A> It is however found in an inscription so far back as the year of Rome 531, before Christ 222, recording the victory of Claudius Marcellus over the Galli Insubres and their allies the Germans, at Clastidium, now Chiastezzo in the Milanese.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_25"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">25</FONT></A> This is illustrated by a passage in Caesar, Bell. Gall. ii. 4, where, after mentioning that several of the Belgae were descended from the Germans who had formerly crossed the Rhine and expelled the Gauls, he says, "the first of these emigrants were the Condrusii, Eburones, Caeresi and Paemani, who were called by the common name of Germans." The derivation of German is <i>Wehr mann</i>, a warrior, or man of war. This appellation was first used by the victorious Cisrhenane tribes, but not by the whole Transrhenane nation, till they gradually adopted it, as equally due to them on account of their military reputation. The Tungri were formerly a people of great name, the relics of which still exist in the extent of the district now termed the ancient diocese of Tongres.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_26"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">26</FONT></A> Under this name Tacitus speaks of some German deity, whose attributes corresponded in the main with those of the Greek and Roman Hercules. What he was called by the Germans is a matter of doubt.--<i>White</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_27"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">27</FONT></A> <i>Quem barditum vocant</i>. The word <i>barditus</i> is of Gallic origin, being derived from <i>bardi</i>, "bards;" it being a custom with the Gauls for bards to accompany the army, and celebrate the heroic deeds of their great warriors; so that <i>barditum</i> would thus signify "the fulfilment of the bard's office." Hence it is clear that <i>barditum</i> could not be used correctly here, inasmuch as amongst the Germans not any particular, appointed, body of men, but the whole army chanted forth the war-song. Some editions have <i>baritum</i>, which is said to be derived from the German word <i>beren</i>, or <i>baeren</i>, "to shout;" and hence it is translated in some dictionaries as, "the German war-song." From the following passage extracted from Facciolati, it would seem, however, that German critics repudiate this idea: "De <i>barito</i> clamore bellico, seu, ut quaedam habent exemplaria, <i>bardito</i>, nihil audiuimus nunc in Germani&acirc;: nisi hoc dixerimus, qu&ograve;d <i>bracht</i>, vel <i>brecht</i>, milites Germani appellare consueverunt; concursum videlicet certantium, et clamorem ad pugnam descendentium; quem <i>bar, bar, bar</i>, sonuisse nonnulli affirmant."--(Andr. Althameri, Schol. in C. Tacit De Germanis.) Ritter, himself a German, affirms that <i>baritus</i> is a reading worth nothing; and that <i>barritus</i> was not the name of the ancient German war-song, but of the shout raised by the Romans in later ages when on the point of engaging; and that it was derived "a clamore barrorem, <i>i.e.</i> elephantorum." The same learned editor considers that the words "quem barditum vocant" have been originally the marginal annotation of some unsound scholar, and have been incorporated by some transcriber into the text of his MS. copy, whence the error has spread. He therefore encloses them between brackets, to show that, in his judgment, they are not the genuine production of the pen of Tacitus.--<i>White</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_28"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">28</FONT></A> A very curious coincidence with the ancient German opinion concerning the prophetic nature of the war-cry or song, appears in the following passage of the Life of Sir Ewen Cameron, in "Pennant's Tour," 1769, Append, p. 363. At the battle of Killicrankie, just before the fight began, "he (Sir Ewen) commanded such of the Camerons as were posted near him to make a great shout, which being seconded by those who stood on the right and left, ran quickly through the whole army, and was returned by the enemy. But the noise of the muskets and cannon, with the echoing of the hills, made the Highlanders fancy that their shouts were much louder and brisker than those of the enemy, and Lochiel cried out, 'Gentlemen, take courage, the day is ours: I am the oldest commander in the army, and have always observed something ominous and fatal in such a dull, hollow and feeble noise as the enemy made in their shout, which prognosticates that they are all doomed to die by our hands this night; whereas ours was brisk, lively and strong, and shows we have vigor and courage.' These words, spreading quickly through the army, animated the troops in a strange manner. The event justified the prediction; the Highlanders obtained a complete victory."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_29"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">29</FONT></A> Now Asburg in the county of Meurs.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_30"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">30</FONT></A> The Greeks, by means of their colony at Marseilles, introduced their letters into Gaul, and the old Gallic coins have many Greek characters in their inscriptions. The Helvetians also, as we are informed by Caesar, used Greek letters. Thence they might easily pass by means of commercial intercourse to the neighboring Germans. Count Marsili and others have found monuments with Greek inscriptions in Germany, but not of so early an age.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_31"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">31</FONT></A> The large bodies of the Germans are elsewhere taken notice of by Tacitus, and also by other authors. It would appear as if most of them were at that time at least six feet high. They are still accounted some of the tallest people in Europe.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_32"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">32</FONT></A> Bavaria and Austria.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_33"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">33</FONT></A> The greater degree of cold when the country was overspread with woods and marshes, made this observation more applicable than at present. The same change of temperature from clearing and draining the land has taken place in North America. It may be added, that the Germans, as we are afterwards informed, paid attention to no kind of culture but that of corn.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_34"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">34</FONT></A> The cattle of some parts of Germany are at present remarkably large; so that their former smallness must have rather been owing to want of care in feeding them and protecting them from the inclemencies of winter, and in improving the breed by mixtures, than to the nature of the climate.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_35"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">35</FONT></A> Mines both of gold and silver have since been discovered in Germany; the former, indeed, inconsiderable; but the latter, valuable.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_36"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">36</FONT></A> As vice and corruption advanced among the Romans, their money became debased and adulterated. Thus Pliny, xxxiii. 3, relates, that "Livius Drusus during his tribuneship, mixed an eighth part of brass with the silver coin;" and ibid. 9, "that Antony the triumvir mixed iron with the denarius: that some coined base metal, others diminished the pieces, and hence it became an art to prove the goodness of the denarii." One precaution for this purpose was cutting the edges like the teeth of a saw, by which means it was seen whether the metal was the same quite through, or was only plated. These were the Serrati, or serrated Denarii. The Bigati were those stamped with the figure of a chariot drawn by two horses, as were the Quadrigati with a chariot and four horses. These were old coin, of purer silver than those of the emperors. Hence the preference of the Germans for certain kinds of species was founded on their apprehension of being cheated with false money.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_37"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">37</FONT></A> The Romans had the same predilection for silver coin, and probably on the same account originally. Pliny, in the place above cited, expresses his surprise that "the Roman people had always imposed a tribute in silver on conquered nations; as at the end of the second Punic war, when they demanded an annual payment in silver for fifty years, without any gold."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_38"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">38</FONT></A> Iron was in great abundance in the bowels of the earth; but this barbarous people had neither patience, skill, nor industry to dig and work it. Besides, they made use of weapons of stone, great numbers of which are found in ancient tombs and barrows.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_39"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">39</FONT></A> This is supposed to take its name from <i>pfriem</i> or <i>priem</i>, the point of a weapon. Afterwards, when iron grew more plentiful, the Germans chiefly used swords.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_40"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">40</FONT></A> It appears, however, from Tacitus's Annals, ii. 14, that the length of these spears rendered them unmanageable in an engagement among trees and bushes.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_41"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">41</FONT></A> Notwithstanding the manner of fighting is so much changed in modern times, the arms of the ancients are still in use. We, as well as they, have two kinds of swords, the sharp-pointed, and edged (small sword and sabre). The broad lance subsisted till lately in the halberd; the spear and framea in the long pike and spontoon; the missile weapons in the war hatchet, or North American tomahawk. There are, besides, found in the old German barrows, perforated stone balls, which they threw by means of thongs passed through them.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_42"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">42</FONT></A> <i>Nudi</i>. The Latin nudus, like the Greek <i>gemnos</i>, does not point out a person devoid of all clothing, but merely one without an upper garment--clad merely in a vest or tunic, and that perhaps a short one.--<i>White</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_43"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">43</FONT></A> This decoration at first denoted the valor, afterwards the nobility, of the bearer; and in process of time gave origin to the armorial ensigns so famous in the ages of chivalry. The shields of the private men were simply colored; those of the chieftains had the figures of animals painted on them.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_44"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">44</FONT></A> Plutarch, in his Life of Marius, describes somewhat differently the arms and equipage of the Cimbri. "They wore (says he) helmets representing the heads of wild beasts, and other unusual figures, and crowned with a winged crest, to make them appear taller. They were covered with iron coats of mail, and carried white glittering shields. Each had a battle-axe; and in close fight they used large heavy swords." But the learned Eccard justly observes, that they had procured these arms in their march; for the Holsatian barrows of that age contain few weapons of brass, and none of iron; but stone spear-heads, and instead of swords, the wedgelike bodies vulgarly called thunderbolts.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_45"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">45</FONT></A> Casques (<i>cassis</i>) are of metal; helmets (<i>galea</i>) of leather--<i>Isidorus</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_46"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">46</FONT></A> This mode of fighting is admirably described by Caesar. "The Germans engaged after the following manner:--There were 6,000 horse, and an equal number of the swiftest and bravest foot; who were chosen, man by man, by the cavalry, for their protection. By these they were attended in battle; to these they retreated; and, these, if they were hard pressed, joined them in the combat. If any fell wounded from their horses, by these they were covered. If it were necessary to advance or retreat to any considerable distance, such agility had they acquired by exercise, that, supporting themselves by the horses' manes, they kept pace with them."--Bell. Gall. i. 48.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_47"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">47</FONT></A> To understand this, it is to be remarked, that the Germans were divided into nations or tribes,--these into cantons, and these into districts or townships. The cantons (<i>pagi</i> in Latin) were called by themselves <i>gauen</i>. The districts or townships (<i>vici</i>) were called <i>hunderte</i>, whence the English hundreds. The name given to these select youth, according to the learned Dithmar, was <i>die hunderte</i>, hundred men. From the following passage in Caesar, it appears that in the more powerful tribes a greater number was selected from each canton. "The nation of the Suevi is by far the greatest and most warlike of the Germans. They are said to inhabit a hundred cantons; from each of which a thousand men are sent annually to make war out of their own territories. Thus neither the employments of agriculture, nor the use of arms are interrupted."--Bell. Gall. iv. 1. The warriors were summoned by the <i>heribannum</i>, or army-edict; whence is derived the French arri&egrave;re-ban.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_48"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">48</FONT></A> A wedge is described by Vegetius (iii. 19,) as a body of infantry, narrow in front, and widening towards the rear; by which disposition they were enabled to break the enemy's ranks, as all their weapons were directed to one spot. The soldiers called it a boar's head.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_49"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">49</FONT></A> It was also considered as the height of injury to charge a person with this unjustly. Thus, by the <i>Salic</i> law, tit. xxxiii, 5, a fine of 600 denarii (about 9<i>l.</i>) is imposed upon "every free man who shall accuse another of throwing down his shield, and running away, without being able to prove it."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_50"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">50</FONT></A> Vertot (M&eacute;m. de l'Acad. des Inscrip.) supposes that the French <i>maires du palais</i> had their origin from these German military leaders. If the kings were equally conspicuous for valor as for birth, they united the regal with the military command. Usually, however, several kings and generals were assembled in their wars. In this case, the most eminent commanded, and obtained a common jurisdiction in war, which did not subsist in time of peace. Thus Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi.) says, "In peace they have no common magistracy." A general was elected by placing him on a shield, and lifting him on the shoulders of the bystanders. The same ceremonial was observed in the election of kings.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_51"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">51</FONT></A> Hence Ambiorix, king of the Eburones, declare that "the nature of his authority was such, that the people had no less power over him, than he over the people."--Caesar, Bell. Gall. v. The authority of the North American chiefs almost exactly similar.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_52"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">52</FONT></A> The power of life and death, however, was in the hands of magistrates. Thus Caesar: "When a state engages either in an offensive or defensive war, magistrates are chosen to preside over it, and exercise power of life and death."--Bell. Gall. vi. The infliction of punishments was committed to the priests, in order to give them more solemnity, and render them less invidious.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_53"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">53</FONT></A> <i>Effigiesque et signa quaedam</i>. That effigies does not mean the images of their deities is proved by that is stated at chap. ix., viz. that they deemed it derogatory to their deities to represent them in human form; and, if in human form, we may argue, <i>a fortiori</i>, in the form of the lower animals. The interpretation of the passage will be best derived from Hist. iv. 22, where Tacitus says:--"Depromptae silvis lucisve ferarum imagines, ut cuique genti inire praelium mos est." It would hence appear that these effigies and signa were images of wild animals, and were national standards preserved with religious care in sacred woods and groves, whence they were brought forth when the clan or tribe was about to take the field.--<i>White</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_54"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">54</FONT></A> They not only interposed to prevent the flight of their husbands and sons, but, in desperate emergencies, themselves engaged in battle. This happened on Marius's defeat of the Cimbri (hereafter to be mentioned); and Dio relates, that when Marcus Aurelius overthrew the Marcomanni, Quadi, and other German allies, the bodies of women in armor were found among the slain.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_55"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">55</FONT></A> Thus, in the army of Ariovistus, the women, with their hair dishevelled, and weeping, besought the soldiers not to deliver them captives to the Romans.--Caesar, Bell. Gall. i.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_56"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">56</FONT></A> Relative to this, perhaps, is a circumstance mentioned by Suetonius in his Life of Augustus. "From some nations he attempted to exact a new kind of hostages, women: because he observed that those of the male sex were disregarded."--Aug. xxi.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_57"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">57</FONT></A> See the same observation with regard to the Celtic women, in Plutarch, on the virtues of women. The North Americans pay a similar regard to their females.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_58"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">58</FONT></A> A remarkable instance of this is given by Caesar. "When he inquired of the captives the reason why Ariovistus did not engage, he learned, that it was because the matrons, who among the Germans are accustomed to pronounce, from their divinations, whether or not a battle will be favorable, had declared that they would not prove victorious, if they should fight before the new moon."--Bell. Gall. i. The cruel manner in which the Cimbrian women performed their divinations is thus related by Strabo: "The women who follow the Cimbri to war, are accompanied by gray-haired prophetesses, in white vestments, with canvas mantles fastened by clasps, a brazen girdle, and naked feet. These go with drawn swords through the camp, and, striking down those of the prisoners that they meet, drag them to a brazen kettle, holding about twenty amphorae. This has a kind of stage above it, ascending on which, the priestess cuts the throat of the victim, and, from the manner in which the blood flows into the vessel, judges of the future event. Others tear open the bodies of the captives thus butchered, and, from inspection of the entrails, presage victory to their own party."--Lib. vii.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_59"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">59</FONT></A> She was afterwards taken prisoner by Rutilius Gallicus. Statius, in his Sylvae, i. 4, refers to this event. Tacitus has more concerning her in his History, iv. 61.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_60"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">60</FONT></A> Viradesthis was a goddess of the Tungri; Harimella, another provincial deity; whose names were found by Mr. Pennant inscribed on altars at the Roman station at Burrens. These were erected by the German auxiliaries.--Vide Tour in Scotland, 1772, part ii. p. 406.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_61"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">61</FONT></A> Ritter considers that here is a reference to the servile flattery of the senate as exhibited in the time of Nero, by the deification of Poppaea's infant daughter, and afterwards of herself. (See Ann. xv. 23, Dion. lxiii, Ann. xiv. 3.) There is no contradiction in the present passage to that found at Hist. iv. 61, where Tacitus says, "plerasque feminarum fatidicas et, augescente superstitione, arbitrantur deas;" <i>i.e.</i> they deem (<i>arbitrantur</i>) very many of their women possessed of prophetic powers, and, as their religious feeling increases, they deem (<i>arbitrantur</i>) them goddesses, <i>i.e.</i> possessed of a superhuman nature; they do not, however, make them goddesses and worship them, as the Romans did Poppaea and her infant, which is covertly implied in <i>facerent deas</i>.--<i>White</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_62"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">62</FONT></A> Mercury, <i>i.e.</i> a god whom Tacitus thus names, because his attributes resembled those of the Roman Mercury. According to Paulus Diaconus (de Gestis Langobardorum, i. 9), this deity was Wodun, or Gwodan, called also Odin. Mallet (North. Ant. ch. v.) says, that in the Icelandic mythology he is called "the terrible and severe God, the Father of Slaughter, he who giveth victory and receiveth courage in the conflict, who nameth those that are to be slain." "The Germans drew their gods by their own character, who loved nothing so much themselves as to display their strength and power in battle, and to signalize their vengeance upon their enemies by slaughter and desolation." There remain to this day some traces of the worship paid to Odin in the name given by almost all the people of the north to the fourth day of the week, which was formerly consecrated to him. It is called by a name which signifies "Odin's day;" "Old Norse, <i>Odinsdagr</i>; Swedish and Danish, <i>Onsdag</i>; Anglo-Saxon, <i>Wodenesdaeg</i>, <i>Wodnesdaeg</i>; Dutch, <i>Woensdag</i>; English, Wednesday. As Odin or Wodun was supposed to correspond to the Mercury of the Greeks and Romans, the name of this day was expressed in Latin <i>Dies Mercurii</i>."--<i>White</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_63"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">63</FONT></A> "The appointed time for these sacrifices," says Mallet (North. Ant. ch. vi.), "was always determined by a superstitious opinion which made the northern nations regard the number 'three' as sacred and particularly dear to the gods. Thus, in every ninth month they renewed the bloody ceremony, which was to last nine days, and every day they offered up nine living victims, whether men or animals. But the most solemn sacrifices were those which were offered up at Upsal in Sweden every ninth year...." After stating the compulsory nature of the attendance at this festival, Mallet adds, "Then they chose among the captives in time of war, and among the slaves in time of peace, nine persons to be sacrificed. In whatever manner they immolated men, the priest always took care in consecrating the victim to pronounce certain words, as 'I devote thee to Odin,' 'I send thee to Odin.'" See Lucan i. 444.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_64"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">64</FONT></A> That is, as in the preceding case, a deity whose attributes corresponded to those of the Roman Mars. This appears to have been not <i>Thor</i>, who is rather the representative of the Roman Jupiter, but <i>Tyr</i>, "a warrior god, and the protector of champions and brave men!" "From <i>Tyr</i> is derived the name given to the third day of the week in most of the Teutonic languages, and which has been rendered into Latin by <i>Dies Martis</i>. Old Norse, <i>Tirsdagr</i>, <i>Tisdagr</i>; Swedish, <i>Tisdag</i>; Danish, <i>Tirsdag</i>; German, <i>Dienstag</i>; Dutch, <i>Dingsdag</i>; Anglo-Saxon, <i>Tyrsdaeg</i>, <i>Tyvesdag</i>, <i>Tivesdaeg</i>; English, <i>Tuesday</i> "--(Mallet's North. Ant. ch. v.)--<i>White</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_65"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">65</FONT></A> The Suevi appear to have been the Germanic tribes, and this also the worship spoken of at chap. xl. <i>Signum in modum liburnae figuration</i> corresponds with the <i>vehiculum</i> there spoken of; the real thing being, according to Ritter's view, a pinnace placed on wheels. That <i>signum ipsum </i>("the very symbol") does not mean any image of the goddess, may be gathered also from ch. xl., where the goddess herself, <i>si credere velis</i>, is spoken of as being washed in the sacred lake.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_66"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">66</FONT></A> As the Romans in their ancient coins, many of which are now extant, recorded the arrival of Saturn by the stern of a ship; so other nations have frequently denoted the importation of a foreign religious rite by the figure of a galley on their medals.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_67"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">67</FONT></A> Tacitus elsewhere speaks of temples of German divinities (e.g. 40; Templum Nerthae, Ann. i. 51; Templum Tanfanae); but a consecrated grove, or any other sacred place, was called templum by the Romans.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_68"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">68</FONT></A> The Scythians are mentioned by Herodotus, and the Alans by Ammianus Marcellinus, as making use of these divining rods. The German method of divination with them is illustrated by what is said by Saxo-Grammaticus (Hist. Dan. xiv, 288) of the inhabitants of the Isle of Rugen in the Baltic Sea: "Throwing, by way of lots, three pieces of wood, white in one part, and black in another, into their laps, they foretold good fortune by the coming up of the white; bad by that of the black."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_69"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">69</FONT></A> The same practice obtained among the Persians, from whom the Germans appear to be sprung. Darius was elected king by the neighing of a horse; sacred white horses were in the army of Cyrus; and Xerxes, retreating after his defeat, was preceded by the sacred horses and consecrated chariot. Justin (i. 10) mentions the cause of this superstition, viz. that "the Persians believed the Sun to be the only God, and horses to be peculiarly consecrated to him." The priest of the Isle of Rugen also took auspices from a white horse, as may be seen in Saxo-Grammaticus.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_70"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">70</FONT></A> Montesquieu finds in this custom the origin of the duel, and of knight-errantry.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_71"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">71</FONT></A> This remarkable passage, so curious in political history, is commented on by Montesquieu, in his Spirit of Laws. vi 11. That celebrated author expresses his surprise at the existence of such a balance between liberty and authority in the forests of Germany; and traces the origin of the English constitution from this source. Tacitus again mentions the German form of government in his Annals, iv. 33.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_72"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">72</FONT></A> The high antiquity of this made of reckoning appears from the Book of Genesis. "The evening and the morning were the first day." The Gauls, we are informed by Caesar, "assert that, according to the tradition of their Druids, they are all sprung from Father Dis; on which account they reckon every period of time according to the number of nights, not of days; and observe birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in such a manner, that the day seems to follow the night." (Bell. Gall. vi. 18.) The vestiges of this method of computation still appear in the English language, in the terms se'nnight and fort'night.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_73"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">73</FONT></A> <i>Ut turbae placuit</i>. Doederlein interprets this passage as representing the confused way in which the people took their seats in the national assembly, without reference to order, rank, age, &amp;c. It rather represents, however, that the people, not the chieftains, determined when the business of the council should begin.--<i>White</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_74"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">74</FONT></A> And in an open plain. Vast heaps of stone still remaining, denote the scenes of these national councils. (See Mallet's Introduct. to Hist. of Denmark.) The English Stonehenge has been supposed a relic of this kind. In these assemblies are seen the origin of those which, under the Merovingian race of French kings, were called the Fields of March; under the Carlovingian, the Fields of May; then, the Plenary Courts of Christmas and Easter; and lastly, the States General.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_75"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">75</FONT></A> The speech of Civilis was received with this expression of applause. Tacitus, Hist. iv. 15.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_76"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">76</FONT></A> Gibbeted alive. Heavy penalties were denounced against those who should take them down, alive or dead. These are particularized in the Salic law.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_77"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">77</FONT></A> By cowards and dastards, in this passage, are probably meant those who, being summoned to war, refused or neglected to go. Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi. 22) mentions, that those who refused to follow their chiefs to war were considered as deserters and traitors. And, afterwards, the emperor Clothaire made the following edict, preserved in the Lombard law: "Whatever freeman, summoned to the defence of his country by his Count, or his officers, shall neglect to go, and the enemy enter the country to lay it waste, or otherwise damage our liege subjects, he shall incur a capital punishment." As the crimes of cowardice, treachery, and desertion were so odious and ignominious among the Germans, we find by the Salic law, that penalties were annexed to the unjust imputation of them.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_78"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">78</FONT></A> These were so rare and so infamous among the Germans, that barely calling a person by a name significant of them was severely punished.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_79"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">79</FONT></A> Incestuous people were buried alive in bogs in Scotland. Pennant's Tour in Scotland, 1772; part i. p. 351; and part ii. p. 421.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_80"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">80</FONT></A> Among these slighter offences, however, were reckoned homicide, adultery, theft, and many others of a similar kind. This appears from the laws of the Germans, and from a subsequent passage of Tacitus himself.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_81"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">81</FONT></A> These were at that time the only riches of the country, as was already observed in this treatise. Afterwards gold and silver became plentiful: hence all the mulcts required by the Salic law are pecuniary. Money, however, still bore a fixed proportion to cattle; as appears from the Saxon law (Tit. xviii.): "The Solidus is of two kinds; one contains two tremisses, that is, a beeve of twelve months, or a sheep with its lamb; the other, three tremisses, or a beeve of sixteen months. Homicide is compounded for by the lesser solidus; other crimes by the greater." The Saxons had their Weregeld,--the Scotch their Cro, Galnes, and Kelchin,--and the Welsh their Gwerth, and Galanus, or compensations for injuries; and cattle were likewise the usual fine. Vide Pennant's Tour in Wales of 1773, pp. 273, 274.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_82"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">82</FONT></A> This mulct is frequently in the Salic law called "fred," that is, peace; because it was paid to the king or state, as guardians of the public peace.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_83"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">83</FONT></A> A brief account of the civil economy of the Germans will here be useful. They were divided into nations; of which some were under a regal government, others a republican. The former had kings, the latter chiefs. Both in kingdoms and republics, military affairs were under the conduct of the generals. The nations were divided into cantons; each of which was superintended by a chief, or count, who administered justice in it. The cantons were divided into districts or hundreds, so called because they contained a hundred vills or townships. In each hundred was a companion, or centenary, chosen from the people, before whom small causes were tried. Before the count, all causes, as well great as small, were amenable. The centenaries are called companions by Tacitus, after the custom of the Romans; among whom the titles of honor were, Caesar, the Legatus or Lieutenant of Caesar, and his comites, or companions. The courts of justice were held in the open air, on a rising ground, beneath the shade of an oak, elm, or some other large tree.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_84"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">84</FONT></A> Even judges were armed on the seat of justice. The Romans, on the contrary, never went armed but when actually engaged in military service.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_85"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">85</FONT></A> These are the rudiments of the famous institution of chivalry. The sons of kings appear to have received arms from foreign princes. Hence, when Audoin, after overcoming the Gepidae, was requested by the Lombards to dine with his son Alboin, his partner in the victory, he refused; for, says he, "you know it is not customary with us for a king's son to dine with his father, until he has received arms from the king of another country."--Warnefrid, De gestis Langobardorum, i. 23.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_86"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">86</FONT></A> An allusion to the <i>toga virilis</i> of the Romans. The German youth were presented with the shield and spear probably at twelve or fifteen years of age. This early initiation into the business of arms gave them that warlike character for which they were so celebrated. Thus, Seneca (Epist. 46) says, "A native of Germany brandishes, while yet a boy, his slender javelin." And again (in his book on Anger, i. 11), "Who are braver than the Germans?--who more impetuous in the charge?--who fonder of arms, in the use of which they are born and nourished, which are their only care?--who more inured to hardships, insomuch that for the most part they provide no covering for their bodies, no retreat against the perpetual severity of the climate?"</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_87"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">87</FONT></A> Hence it seems that these noble lads were deemed <i>principes</i> in rank, yet had their position among the <i>comites</i> only. The German word <i>Gesell</i> is peculiarly appropriated to these comrades in arms. So highly were they esteemed in Germany, that for killing or hurting them a fine was exacted treble to that for other freemen.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_88"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">88</FONT></A> Hence, when Chonodomarus, king of the Alamanni, was taken prisoner by the Romans, "his companions, two hundred in number, and three friends peculiarly attached to him, thinking it infamous to survive their prince, or not to die for him, surrendered themselves to be put in bonds."--Ammianus Marcellinus, xvi. 13.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_89"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">89</FONT></A> Hence Montesquieu (Spirit of Laws, xxx, 3) justly derives the origin of vassalage. At first, the prince gave to his nobles arms and provision: as avarice advanced, money, and then lands, were required, which from benefices became at length hereditary possessions, and were called fiefs. Hence the establishment of the feudal system.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_90"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">90</FONT></A> Caesar, with less precision, says, "The Germans pass their whole lives in hunting and military exercises." (Bell. Gall, vi. 21.) The picture drawn by Tacitus is more consonant to the genius of a barbarous people: besides that, hunting being the employment but of a few months of the year, a greater part must necessarily be passed in indolence by those who had no other occupation. In this circumstance, and those afterwards related, the North American savages exactly agree with the ancient Germans.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_91"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">91</FONT></A> This apparent contradiction is, however, perfectly agreeable to the principles of human nature. Among people governed by impulse more than reason, everything is in the extreme: war and peace; motion and rest; love and hatred; none are pursued with moderation.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_92"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">92</FONT></A> These are the rudiments of tributes; though the contributions here spoken of were voluntary, and without compulsion. The origin of exchequers is pointed out above, where "part of the mulct" is said to be "paid to the king or state." Taxation was taught the Germans by the Romans, who levied taxes upon them.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_93"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">93</FONT></A> So, in after-times, when tributes were customary, 500 oxen or cows were required annually from the Saxons by the French kings Clothaire I. and Pepin. (See Eccard, tom. i. pp. 84, 480.) Honey, corn, and other products of the earth, were likewise received in tribute. (Ibid. p. 392.)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_94"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">94</FONT></A> For the expenses of war, and other necessities of state, and particularly the public entertainments. Hence, besides the Steora, or annual tribute, the Osterstuopha, or Easter cup, previous to the public assembly of the Field of March, was paid to the French kings.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_95"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">95</FONT></A> This was a dangerous lesson, and in the end proved ruinous to the Roman empire. Herodian says of the Germans in his time, "They are chiefly to be prevailed upon by bribes; being fond of money, and continually selling peace to the Romans for gold."--Lib. vi. 139.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_96"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">96</FONT></A> This custom was of long duration; for there is not the mention of a single city in Ammianus Marcellinus, who wrote on the wars of the Romans in Germany. The names of places in Ptolemy (ii. 11) are not, therefore, those of cities, but of scattered villages. The Germans had not even what we should call towns, notwithstanding Caesar asserts the contrary.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_97"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">97</FONT></A> The space surrounding the house, and fenced in by hedges, was that celebrated Salic land, which descended to the male line, exclusively of the female.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_98"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">98</FONT></A> The danger of fire was particularly urgent in time of war; for, as Caesar informs us, these people were acquainted with a method of throwing red-hot clay bullets from slings, and burning javelins, on the thatch of houses. (Bell. Gall. v. 42.)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_99"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">99</FONT></A> Thus likewise Mela (ii. 1), concerning the Sarmatians: "On account of the length and severity of their winters, they dwell under ground, either in natural or artificial caverns." At the time that Germany was laid waste by a forty years' war, Kircher saw many of the natives who, with their flocks, herds, and other possessions, took refuge in the caverns of the highest mountains. For many other curious particulars concerning these and other subterranean caves, see his Mundus Subterraneus, viii. 3, p. 100. In Hungary, at this day, corn is commonly stored in subterranean chambers.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_100"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">100</FONT></A> Near Newbottle, the seat of the Marquis of Lothian, are some subterraneous apartments and passages cut out of the live rock, which had probably served for the same purposes of winter-retreats and granaries as those dug by the ancient Germans. Pennant's Tour in 1769, 4to, p.63.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_101"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">101</FONT></A> This was a kind of mantle of a square form, called also <i>rheno</i>. Thus Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi. 21): "They use skins for clothing, or the short rhenones, and leave the greatest part of the body naked." Isidore (xix. 23) describes the rhenones as "garments covering the shoulders and breast, as low as the navel, so rough and shaggy that they are impenetrable to rain." Mela (iii. 3), speaking of the Germans, says, "The men are clothed only with the sagum, or the bark of trees, even in the depth of winter."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_102"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">102</FONT></A> All savages are fond of variety of colors; hence the Germans spotted their furs with the skins of other animals, of which those here mentioned were probably of the seal kind. This practice is still continued with regard to the ermine, which is spotted with black lamb's-skin.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_103"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">103</FONT></A> The Northern Sea, and Frozen Ocean.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_104"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">104</FONT></A> Pliny testifies the same thing; and adds, that "the women beyond the Rhine are not acquainted with any more elegant kind of clothing."--xix. 1.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_105"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">105</FONT></A> Not that rich and costly purple in which the Roman nobility shone, but some ordinary material, such as the <i>vaccinium</i>, which Pliny says was used by the Gauls as a purple dye for the garments of the slaves, (xvi. 18.)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_106"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">106</FONT></A> The chastity of the Germans, and their strict regard to the laws of marriage, are witnessed by all their ancient codes of law. The purity of their manners in this respect afforded a striking contrast to the licentiousness of the Romans in the decline of the empire, and is exhibited in this light by Salvian, in his treatise De Gubernatione Dei, lib. vii.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_107"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">107</FONT></A> Thus we find in Caesar (Bell. Gall. i. 53) that Ariovistus had two wives. Others had more. This indulgence proved more difficult to abolish, as it was considered as a mark of opulence, and an appendage of nobility.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_108"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">108</FONT></A> The Germans purchased their wives, as appears from the following clauses in the Saxon law concerning marriage: "A person who espouses a wife shall pay to her parents 300 solidi (about 180<i>l.</i> sterling); but if the marriage be without the consent of the parents, the damsel, however, consenting, he shall pay 600 solidi. If neither the parents nor damsel consent, that is, if she be carried off by violence, he shall pay 300 solidi to the parents, and 340 to the damsel, and restore her to her parents."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_109"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">109</FONT></A> Thus in the Saxon law, concerning dowries, it is said: "The Ostfalii and Angrarii determine, that if a woman have male issue, she is to possess the dower she received in marriage during her life, and transmit it to her sons."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_110"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">110</FONT></A> <i>Ergo septae pudiciti&acirc; agunt</i>. Some editions have <i>sept&acirc; pudiciti&acirc;</i>. This would imply, however, rather the result of the care and watchfulness of their husbands; whereas it seems the object of Tacitus to show that this their chastity was the effect of innate virtue, and this is rather expressed by <i>septae pudiciti&acirc;</i>, which is the reading of the Arundelian MS.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_111"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">111</FONT></A> Seneca speaks with great force and warmth on this subject: "Nothing is so destructive to morals as loitering at public entertainments; for vice more easily insinuates itself into the heart when softened by pleasure. What shall I say! I return from them more covetous ambitious, and luxurious."--Epist. vii.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_112"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">112</FONT></A> The Germans had a great regard for the hair, and looked upon cutting it off as a heavy disgrace; so that this was made a punishment for certain crimes, and was resented as an injury if practised upon an innocent person.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_113"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">113</FONT></A> From an epistle of St. Boniface, archbishop of Mentz, to Ethelbald, king of England, we learn that among the Saxons the women themselves inflicted the punishment for violated chastity; "In ancient Saxony (now Westphalia), if a virgin pollute her father's house, or a married woman prove false to her vows, sometimes she is forced to put an end to her own life by the halter, and over the ashes of her burned body her seducer is hanged: sometimes a troop of females assembling lead her through the circumjacent villages, lacerating her body, stripped to the girdle, with rods and knives; and thus, bloody and full of minute wounds, she is continually met by new tormenters, who in their zeal for chastity do not quit her till she is dead, or scarcely alive, in order to inspire a dread of such offences." See Michael Alford's Annales Ecclesiae Anglo-Saxon., and Eccard.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_114"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">114</FONT></A> A passage in Valerius Maximus renders it probable that the Cimbrian states were of this number: "The wives of the Teutones besought Marius, after his victory, that he would deliver them as a present to the Vestal virgins; affirming that they should henceforth, equally with themselves, abstain from the embraces of the other sex. This request not being granted, they all strangled themselves the ensuing night."--Lib. vi. 1.3.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_115"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">115</FONT></A> Among the Heruli, the wife was expected to hang herself at once at the grave of her husband, if she would not live in perpetual infamy.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_116"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">116</FONT></A> This expression may signify as well the murder of young children, as the procurement of abortion; both which crimes were severely punished by the German laws.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_117"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">117</FONT></A> <i>Quemquam ex agnatis</i>. By <i>agnati</i> generally in Roman law were meant relations by the father's side; here it signifies children born after there was already an heir to the name and property of the father.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_118"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">118</FONT></A> Justin has a similar thought concerning the Scythians: "Justice is cultivated by the dispositions of the people, not by the laws." (ii. 2.) How inefficacious the good laws here alluded to by Tacitus were in preventing enormities among the Romans, appears from the frequent complaints of the senators, and particularly of Minucius Felix; "I behold you, exposing your babes to the wild beasts and birds, or strangling the unhappy wretches with your own hands. Some of you, by means of drugs, extinguish the newly-formed man within your bowels, and thus commit parricide on your offspring before you bring them into the world." (Octavius, c. 30.) So familiar was this practice grown at Rome, that the virtuous Pliny apologises for it, alleging that "the great fertility of some women may require such a licence."--xxix. 4, 37.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_119"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">119</FONT></A> <i>Nudi ac sordidi</i> does not mean "in nakedness and filth," as most translators have supposed. Personal filth is inconsistent with the daily practice of bathing mentioned c. 22; and <i>nudus</i> does not necessarily imply absolute nakedness (see note 4, p. 293).</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_120"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">120</FONT></A> This age appears at first to have been twelve years; for then a youth became liable to the penalties of law. Thus in the Salic law it is said, "If a child under twelve commit a fault, 'fred,' or a mulct, shall not be required of him." Afterwards the term was fifteen years of age. Thus in the Ripuary law, "A child under fifteen shall not be responsible." Again, "If a man die, or be killed, and leave a son; before he have completed his fifteenth year, he shall neither prosecute a cause, nor be called upon to answer in a suit: but at this term, he must either answer himself, or choose an advocate. In like manner with regard to the female sex." The Burgundian law provides to the same effect. This then was the term of majority, which in later times, when heavier armor was used, was still longer delayed.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_121"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">121</FONT></A> This is illustrated by a passage in Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi. 21): "They who are the latest in proving their virility are most commended. By this delay they imagine the stature is increased, the strength improved, and the nerves fortified. To have knowledge of the other sex before twenty years of age, is accounted in the highest degree scandalous."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_122"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">122</FONT></A> Equal not only in age and constitution, but in condition. Many of the German codes of law annex penalties to those of both sexes who marry persons of inferior rank.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_123"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">123</FONT></A> Hence, in the history of the Merovingian kings of France, so many instances of regard to sisters and their children appear, and so many wars undertaken on their account.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_124"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">124</FONT></A> The court paid at Rome to rich persons without children, by the Haeredipetae, or legacy-hunters, is a frequent subject of censure and ridicule with the Roman writers.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_125"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">125</FONT></A> Avengers of blood are mentioned in the law of Moses, Numb. xxxv. 19. In the Roman law also, under the head of "those who on account of unworthiness are deprived of their inheritance," it is pronounced, that "such heirs as are proved to have neglected revenging the testator's death, shall be obliged to restore the entire profits."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_126"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">126</FONT></A> It was a wise provision, that among this fierce and warlike people, revenge should be commuted for a payment. That this intention might not be frustrated by the poverty of the offender, his whole family were conjointly bound to make compensation.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_127"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">127</FONT></A> All uncivilized nations agree in this property, which becomes less necessary as a nation improves in the arts of civil life.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_128"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">128</FONT></A> <i>Convictibus et hospitiis</i>. "Festivities and entertainments." The former word applies to friends and fellow-countrymen; the latter, to those not of the same tribe, and foreigners. Caesar (Bell. Gall. vi. 23) says, "They think it unlawful to offer violence to their guests, who, on whatever occasion they come to them, are protected from injury, and considered as sacred. Every house is open to them, and provision everywhere set before them." Mela (iii. 3) says of the Germans, "They make right consist in force, so that they are not ashamed of robbery: they are only kind to their guests, and merciful to suppliants. The Burgundian law lays a fine of three solidi on every man who refuses his roof or hearth to the coming guest." The Salic law, however, rightly forbids the exercise of hospitality to atrocious criminals; laying a penalty on the person who shall harbor one who has dug up or despoiled the dead? till he has made satisfaction to the relations.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_129"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">129</FONT></A> The clause here put within brackets is probably misplaced; since it does not connect well either with what goes before or what follows.<A NAME="xref_130"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">130</FONT></A> The Russians are at present the most remarkable among the northern nations for the use of warm bathing. Some of the North American tribes also have their hypocausts, or stoves.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_131"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">131</FONT></A> Eating at separate tables is generally an indication of voracity. Traces of it may be found in Homer, and other writers who have described ancient manners. The same practice has also been observed among the people of Otaheite; who occasionally devour vast quantities of food.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_132"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">132</FONT></A> The following article in the Salic law shows at once the frequency of these bloody quarrels, and the laudable endeavors of the legislature to restrain them;--"If at a feast where there are four or five men in company, one of them be killed, the rest shall either convict one as the offender, or shall jointly pay the composition for his death. And this law shall extend to seven persons present at an entertainment."</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_134"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">134</FONT></A> Of this liquor, beer or ale, Pliny speaks in the following passage: "The western nations have their intoxicating liquor, made of steeped grain. The Egyptians also invented drinks of the same kind. Thus drunkenness is a stranger in no part of the world; for these liquors are taken pure, and not diluted as wine is. Yet, surely, the Earth thought she was producing corn. Oh, the wonderful sagacity of our vices! we have discovered how to render even water intoxicating."--xiv. 22.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_135"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">135</FONT></A> Mela says, "Their manner of living is so rude and savage, that they eat even raw flesh; either fresh killed, or softened by working with their hands and feet, after it has grown stiff in the hides of tame or wild animals." (iii. 3.) Florus relates that the ferocity of the Cimbri was mitigated by their feeding on bread and dressed meat, and drinking wine, in the softest tract of Italy.--iii. 3.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_136"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">136</FONT></A> This must not be understood to have been cheese; although Caesar says of the Germans, "Their diet chiefly consists of milk, cheese and flesh." (Bell. Gall. vi. 22.) Pliny, who was thoroughly acquainted with the German manners, says more accurately, "It is surprising that the barbarous nations who live on milk should for so many ages have been ignorant of, or have rejected, the preparation of cheese; especially since they thicken their milk into a pleasant tart substance, and a fat butter: this is the scum of milk, of a thicker consistence than what is called the whey. It must not be omitted that it has the properties of oil, and is used as an unguent by all the barbarians, and by us for children."--xi. 41.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_137"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">137</FONT></A> This policy has been practised by the Europeans with regard to the North American savages, some tribes of which have been almost totally extirpated by it.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_138"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">138</FONT></A> St. Ambrose has a remarkable passage concerning this spirit of gaming among a barbarous people:--"It is said that the Huns, who continually make war upon other nations, are themselves subject to usurers, with whom they run in debt at play; and that, while they live without laws, they obey the laws of the dice alone; playing when drawn up in line of battle; carrying dice along with their arms, and perishing more by each others' hands than by the enemy. In the midst of victory they submit to become captives, and suffer plunder from their own countrymen, which they know not how to bear from the foe. On this account they never lay aside the business of war, because, when they have lost all their booty by the dice, they have no means of acquiring fresh supplies for play, but by the sword. They are frequently borne away with such a desperate ardor, that, when the loser has given up his arms, the only part of his property which he greatly values, he sets the power over his life at a single cast to the winner or usurer. It is a fact, that a person, known to the Roman emperor, paid the price of a servitude which he had by this means brought upon himself, by suffering death at the command of his master."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_139"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">139</FONT></A> The condition of these slaves was the same as that of the vassals, or serfs, who a few centuries ago made the great body of the people in every country in Europe. The Germans, in after times, imitating the Romans, had slaves of inferior condition, to whom the name of slave became appropriated; while those in the state of rural vassalage were called <i>lidi</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_140"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">140</FONT></A> A private enemy could not be slain with impunity, since a fine was affixed to homicide; but a man might kill his own slave without any punishment. If, however, he killed another person's slave, he was obliged to pay his price to the owner.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_141"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">141</FONT></A> The amazing height of power and insolence to which freedmen arrived by making themselves subservient to the vices of the prince, is a striking characteristic of the reigns of some of the worst of the Roman emperors.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_142"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">142</FONT></A> In Rome, on the other hand, the practice of usury was, as our author terms it, "an ancient evil, and a perpetual source of sedition and discord."--Annals, vi. 16.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_143"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">143</FONT></A> All the copies read <i>per vices</i>, "by turns," or alternately; but the connection seems evidently to require the easy alteration of <i>per vicos</i>, which has been approved by many learned commentators, and is therefore adopted in this translation.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_144"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">144</FONT></A> Caesar has several particulars concerning this part of German polity. "They are not studious of agriculture, the greater part of their diet consisting of milk, cheese, and flesh; nor has any one a determinate portion of land, his own peculiar property; but the magistrates and chiefs allot every year to tribes and clanships forming communities, as much land, and in such situations, as they think proper, and oblige them to remove the succeeding year. For this practice they assign several reasons: as, lest they should be led, by being accustomed to one spot, to exchange the toils of war for the business of agriculture; lest they should acquire a passion for possessing extensive domains, and the more powerful should be tempted to dispossess the weaker; lest they should construct buildings with more art than was necessary to protect them from the inclemencies of the weather; lest the love of money should arise amongst them, the source of faction and dissensions; and in order that the people, beholding their own possessions equal to those of the most powerful, might be retained by the bonds of equity and moderation."--Bell. Gall. vi. 21.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_145"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">145</FONT></A> The Germans, not planting fruit-trees, were ignorant of the proper products of autumn. They have now all the autumnal fruits of their climate; yet their language still retains a memorial of their ancient deficiencies, in having no term for this season of the year, but one denoting the gathering in of corn alone--<i>Herbst</i>, Harvest.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_146"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">146</FONT></A> In this respect, as well as many others, the manners of the Germans were a direct contrast to those of the Romans. Pliny mentions a private person, C. Caecilius Claudius Isidorus, who ordered the sum of about 10,000<i>l.</i> sterling to be expended in his funeral: and in another place he says, "Intelligent persons asserted that Arabia did not produce such a quantity of spices in a year as Nero burned at the obsequies of his Poppaea."--xxxiii. 10, and xii. 18.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_147"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">147</FONT></A> The following lines of Lucan, describing the last honors paid by Cornelia to the body of Pompey the Great, happily illustrate the customs here referred to:--</p>  
<p>Collegit vestes, miserique insignia Magni.<br> Armaque, et impressas auro, quas gesserat olim<br> Exuvias, pictasque togas, velamina summo<br> Ter conspecta Jovi, funestoque intulit igni.--Lib. ix. 175.</p>  
<p>"There shone his arms, with antique gold inlaid,<br> There the rich robes which she herself had made,<br> Robes to imperial Jove in triumph thrice display'd:<br> The relics of his past victorious days,<br> Now this his latest trophy serve to raise,<br> And in one common flame together blaze."--ROWE.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_148"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">148</FONT></A> Thus in the tomb of Childeric, king of the Franks, were found his spear and sword, and also his horse's head, with a shoe, and gold buckles and housings. A human skull was likewise discovered, which, perhaps, was that of his groom.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_149"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">149</FONT></A> Caesar's account is as follows:--"There was formerly a time when the Gauls surpassed the Germans in bravery, and made war upon them; and, on account of their multitude of people and scarcity of land, sent colonies beyond the Rhine. The most fertile parts of Germany, adjoining to the Hercynian forest, (which, I observe, was known by report to Eratosthenes and others of the Greeks, and called by them Orcinia,) were accordingly occupied by the Volcae and Tectosages, who settled there. These people still continue in the same settlements, and have a high character as well for the administration of justice as military prowess: and they now remain in the same state of penury and content as the Germans, whose manner of life they have adopted."--Bell. Gall. vi. 24.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_150"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">150</FONT></A> The inhabitants of Switzerland, then extending further than at present, towards Lyons.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_151"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">151</FONT></A> A nation of Gauls, bordering on the Helvetii, as appears from Strabo and Caesar. After being conquered by Caesar, the Aedui gave them a settlement in the country now called the Bourbonnois. The name of their German colony, Boiemum, is still extant in Bohemia. The aera at which the Helvetii and Boii penetrated into Germany is not ascertained. It seems probable, however, that it was in the reign of Tarquinius Priscus; for at that time, as we are told by Livy, Ambigatus, king of the Bituriges (people of Berry), sent his sister's son Sigovesus into the Hercynian forest, with a colony, in order to exonerate his kingdom which was overpeopled. (Livy, v. 33; <i>et seq.</i>)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_152"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">152</FONT></A> In the time of Augustus, the Boii, driven from Boiemum by the Marcomanni, retired to Noricum, which from them was called Boioaria, now Bavaria.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_154"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">154</FONT></A> Towards the end of this treatise, Tacitus seems himself to decide this point, observing that their use of the Pannonian language, and acquiescence in paying tribute, prove the Osi not to be a German nation. They were settled beyond the Marcomanni and Quadi, and occupied the northern part of Transdanubian Hungary; perhaps extending to Silesia, where is a place called Ossen in the duchy of Oels, famous for salt and glass works. The learned Pelloutier, however, contends that the Osi were Germans; but with less probability.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_158"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">158</FONT></A> Those of the diocese of Cologne. The Ubii, migrating from Germany to Gaul, on account of the enmity of the Catti, and their own attachment to the Roman interest, were received under the protection of Marcus Agrippa, in the year of Rome 717. (Strabo, iv. p. 194.) Agrippina, the wife of Claudius and mother of Nero, who was born among them, obtained the settlement of a colony there, which was called after her name.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_159"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">159</FONT></A> Now the Betuwe, part of the provinces of Holland and Guelderland.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_160"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">160</FONT></A> Hence the Batavi are termed, in an ancient inscription, "the brothers and friends of the Roman people."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_161"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">161</FONT></A> This nation inhabited part of the countries now called the Weteraw, Hesse, Isenburg and Fulda. In this territory was Mattium, now Marpurg, and the Fontes Mattiaci, now Wisbaden, near Mentz.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_162"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">162</FONT></A> The several people of Germany had their respective borders, called marks or marches, which they defended by preserving them in a desert and uncultivated state. Thus Caesar, Bell. Gall. iv 3:--"They think it the greatest honor to a nation, to have as wide an extent of vacant land around their dominions as possible; by which it is indicated, that a great number of neighboring communities are unable to withstand them. On this account, the Suevi are said to have, on one side, a tract of 600 (some learned men think we should read 60) miles desert for their boundaries." In another place Caesar mentions, as an additional reason for this policy, that they think themselves thereby rendered secure from the danger of sudden incursions. (Bell. Gall. vi. 13.)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_163"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">163</FONT></A> The difference between the low situation and moist air of Batavia, and the high and dry country of the Mattiaci, will sufficiently justify this remark, in the opinion of those who allow anything to the influence of climate.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_164"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">164</FONT></A> Now Swabia. When the Marcommanni, towards the end of the reign of Augustus, quitting their settlements near the Rhine, migrated to Bohemia, the lands they left vacant were occupied by some unsettled Gauls among the Rauraci and Sequani. They seem to have been called Decumates (Decimated), because the inhabitants, liable to the incursions of the Germans, paid a tithe of their products to be received under the protection of the Romans. Adrian defended them by a rampart, which extended from Neustadt, a town on the Danube near the mouth of the river Altm&uuml;hl, to the Neckar near Wimpfen; a space of sixty French leagues.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_165"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">165</FONT></A> Of Upper Germany.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_166"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">166</FONT></A> The Catti possessed a large territory between the Rhine, Mayne and Sala, and the Hartz forest on this side of the Weser; where are now the countries of Hesse, Thuringia, part of Paderborn, of Fulda, and of Franconia. Learned writers have frequently noted, that what Caesar, Florus and Ptolemy have said of the Suevi, is to be understood of the Catti. Leibnitz supposes the Catti were so called from the active animal which they resemble in name, the German for cat being <i>Catte</i>, or <i>Hessen</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_167"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">167</FONT></A> Pliny, who was well acquainted with Germany, gives a very striking description of the Hercynian forest:--"The vast trees of the Hercynian forest, untouched for ages, and as old as the world, by their almost immortal destiny exceed common wonders. Not to mention circumstances which would not be credited, it is certain that hills are raised by the repercussion of their meeting roots; and where the earth does not follow them, arches are formed as high as the branches, which, struggling, as it were, with each other, are bent into the form of open gates, so wide, that troops of horse may ride under them."--xvi. 2.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_168"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">168</FONT></A> <i>Duriora corpora</i>. "Hardier frames;" <i>i.e.</i> than the rest of the Germans. At Hist. ii 32. the Germans, in general, are said to have <i>fluxa corpora</i>; while in c. 4 of this treatise they are described as <i>tant&ugrave;m ad impetum valida</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_169"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">169</FONT></A> Floras, ii. 18, well expresses this thought by the sentence "Tanti exercitus, quanti imperator." "An army is worth so much as its general is."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_170"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">170</FONT></A> Thus Civilis is said by our author (Hist. iv. 61), to have let his hair and beard grow in consequence of a private vow. Thus too, in Paul Warnefrid's "History of the Lombards," iii. 7, it is related, that "six thousand Saxons who survived the war, vowed that they would never cut their hair, nor shave their beards, till they had been revenged of their enemies, the Suevi." A later instance of this custom is mentioned by Strada (Bell. Belg. vii. p. 344), of William Lume, one of the Counts of Mark, "who bound himself by a vow not to cut his hair till he had revenged the deaths of Egmont and Horn."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_171"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">171</FONT></A> The iron ring seems to have been a badge of slavery. This custom was revived in later times, but rather with a gallant than a military intention. Thus, in the year 1414, John duke of Bourbon, in order to ingratiate himself with his mistress, vowed, together with sixteen knights and gentlemen, that they would wear, he and the knights a gold ring, the gentlemen a silver one, round their left legs, every Sunday for two years, till they had met with an equal number of knights and gentlemen to contend with them in a tournament. (Vertot, M&eacute;m. de l'Acad. des Inscr. tom. ii. p. 596.)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_172"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">172</FONT></A> It was this nation of Catti, which, about 150 years afterwards, uniting with the remains of the Cherusci on this side the Weser, the Attuarii, Sicambri, Chamavi, Bructeri, and Chauci, entered into the Francic league, and, conquering the Romans, seized upon Gaul. From them are derived the name, manners, and laws of the French.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_173"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">173</FONT></A> These two tribes, united by a community of wars and misfortunes, had formerly been driven from the settlements on the Rhine a little below Mentz. They then, according to Caesar (Bell. Gall. iv. 1, <i>et seq.</i>), occupied the territories of the Menapii on both sides the Rhine. Still proving unfortunate, they obtained the lands of the Sicambri, who, in the reign of Augustus, were removed on this side the Rhine by Tiberius: these were the present counties of Berg, Mark, Lippe, and Waldeck; and the bishopric of Paderborn.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_174"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">174</FONT></A> Their settlements were between the rivers Rhine, Lippe (Luppia), and Ems (Amisia), and the province of Friesland; now the countries of Westphalia and Over-Issel. Alting (Notit. German. Infer, p. 20) supposes they derived their name from <i>Broeken</i>, or <i>Bruchen</i>, marshes, on account of their frequency in that tract of country.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_175"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">175</FONT></A> Before this migration, the Chamavi were settled on the Ems, where at present are Lingen and Osnaburg; the Angrivarii, on the Weser (Visurgis), where are Minden and Schawenburg. A more ancient migration of the Chamavi to the banks of the Rhine is cursorily mentioned by Tacitus, Annal. xiii. 55. The Angrivarii were afterwards called Angrarii, and became part of the Saxon nation.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_176"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">176</FONT></A> They were not so entirely extirpated that no relics of them remained. They were even a conspicuous part of the Francic league, as before related. Claudian also, in his panegyric on the fourth consulate of Honorius, v. 450, mentions them.</p>  
<p>Venit accola sylvae<br> Bructerus Hercyniae.</p>  
<p>"The Bructerian, borderer on the Hercynian forest, came."</p>  
<p>After their expulsion, they settled, according to Eccard, between Cologne and Hesse.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_177"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">177</FONT></A> The Bructeri were under regal government, and maintained many wars against the Romans. Hence their arrogance and power. Before they were destroyed by their countrymen, Vestricius Spurinna terrified them into submission without an action, and had on that account a triumphal statue decreed him. Pliny the younger mentions this fact, book ii. epist. 7.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_178"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">178</FONT></A> An allusion to gladiatorial spectacles. This slaughter happened near the canal of Drusus, where the Roman guard on the Rhine could be spectators of the battle. The account of it came to Rome in the first year of Trajan.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_179"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">179</FONT></A> As this treatise was written in the reign of Trajan, when the affairs of the Romans appeared unusually prosperous, some critics have imagined that Tacitus wrote <i>vigentibus</i>, "flourishing," instead of <i>urgentibus</i>, "urgent." But it is sufficiently evident, from other passages, that the causes which were operating gradually, but surely, to the destruction of the Roman empire, did not escape the penetration of Tacitus, even when disguised by the most flattering appearances. The common reading is therefore, probably, right.--<i>Aikin</i>.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_180"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">180</FONT></A> These people first resided near the head of the Lippe; and then removed to the settlements of the Chamavi and Angrivarii, who had expelled the Bructeri. They appear to have been the same with those whom Velleius Paterculus, ii. 105, calls the Attuarii, and by that name they entered into the Francic league. Strabo calls them Chattuarii.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_181"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">181</FONT></A> Namely, the Ansibarii and Tubantes. The Ansibarii or Amsibarii are thought by Alting to have derived their name from their neighborhood to the river Ems (Amisia); and the. Tubantes, from their frequent change of habitation, to have been called <i>Tho Benten</i>. or the wandering troops, and to have dwelt where now is Drente in Over-Issel. Among these nations, Furstenburg (Monum. Paderborn.) enumerates the Ambrones, borderers upon the river Ambrus, now Emmeren.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_182"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">182</FONT></A> The Frieslanders. The lesser Frisii were settled on this side, the greater, on the other, of the Flevum (Zuyderzee).</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_183"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">183</FONT></A> In the time of the Romans this country was covered by vast meres, or lakes; which were made still larger by frequent inundations of the sea. Of these, one so late as 1530 overwhelmed seventy-two villages; and another, still more terrible, in 1569, laid under water great part of the sea-coast of Holland, and almost all Friesland, in which alone 20,000 persons were drowned.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_184"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">184</FONT></A> Wherever the land seemed to terminate, and it appeared impossible to proceed further, maritime nations have feigned pillars of Hercules. Those celebrated by the Frisians must have been at the extremity of Friesland, and not in Sweden and the Cimmerian promontory, as Rudbeck supposes.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_185"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">185</FONT></A> Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, and father of Germanicus, imposed a tribute on the Frisians, as mentioned in the Annals, iv. 72, and performed other eminent services in Germany; himself styled Germanicus.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_186"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">186</FONT></A> The Chauci extended along the seacoast from the Ems to the Elbe (Albis); whence they bordered on all the fore-mentioned nations, between which and the Cherusci they came round to the Catti. The Chauci were distinguished into Greater and Lesser. The Greater, according to Ptolemy, inhabited the country between the Weser and the Elbe; the Lesser, that between the Weser and Ems; but Tacitus (Annals xi. 19) seems to reverse this order. Alting supposes the Chauci had their name from <i>Kauken</i>, signifying persons eminent for valor and fidelity, which agrees with the character Tacitus gives them. Others derive it from <i>Kauk</i>, an owl, with a reference to the enmity of that animal to cats (<i>Catti</i>). Others, from <i>Kaiten</i>, daws, of which there are great numbers on their coast. Pliny has admirably described the country and manners of the maritime Chauci, in his account of people who live without any trees or fruit-bearing vegetables:--"In the North are the nations of Chauci, who are divided into Greater and Lesser. Here, the ocean, having a prodigious flux and reflux twice in the space of every day and night, rolls over an immense tract, leaving it a matter of perpetual doubt whether it is part of the land or sea. In this spot, the wretched natives, occupying either the tops of hills, or artificial mounds of turf, raised out of reach of the highest tides, build their small cottages; which appear like sailing vessels when the water covers the circumjacent ground, and like wrecks when it has retired. Here from their huts they pursue the fish, continually flying from them with the waves. They do not, like their neighbors, possess cattle, and feed on milk; nor have they a warfare to maintain against wild beasts, for every fruit of the earth is far removed from them. With flags and seaweed they twist cordage for their fishing-nets. For fuel they use a kind of mud, taken up by hand, and dried, rather in the wind than the sun: with this earth they heat their food, and warm their bodies, stiffened by the rigorous north. Their only drink is rain-water collected in ditches at the thresholds of their doors. Yet this miserable people, if conquered to-day by the Roman arms, would call themselves slaves. Thus it is that fortune spares many to their own punishment."--Hist. Nat. xvi. 1.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_187"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">187</FONT></A> On this account, fortified posts were established by the Romans to restrain the Chauci; who by Lucan are called Cayci in the following passage:</p>  
<p>Et vos crinigeros bellis arcere Caycos<br> Oppositi.--Phars. i. 463.</p>  
<p>"You, too, tow'rds Rome advance, ye warlike band,<br> That wont the shaggy Cauci to withstand."--ROWE</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_188"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">188</FONT></A> The Cherusci, at that time, dwelt between the Weser and the Elbe, where now are Luneburg, Brunswick, and part of the Marche of Brandenburg on this side the Elbe. In the reign of Augustus they occupied a more extensive tract; reaching even this side the Weser, as appears from the accounts of the expedition of Drusus given by Dio and Velleius Paterculus: unless, as Dithmar observes, what is said of the Cherusci on this side the Weser relates to the Dulgibini, their dependents. For, according to Strabo, Varus was cut off by the Cherusci, and the people subject to them. The brave actions of Arminius, the celebrated chief of the Cherusci, are related by Tacitus in the 1st and 2d books of his Annals.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_189"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">189</FONT></A> Cluver, and several others, suppose the Fosi to have been the same with the ancient Saxons: but, since they bordered on the Cherusci, the opinion of Leibnitz is nearer the truth, that they inhabited the banks of the river Fusa, which enters the Aller (Allera) at Cellae; and were a sort of appendage to the Cherusci, as Hildesheim now is to Brunswick. The name of Saxons is later than Tacitus, and was not known till the reign of Antoninus Pius, at which period they poured forth from the Cimbric Chersonesus, and afterwards, in conjunction with the Angles, seized upon Britain.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_191"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">191</FONT></A> The name of this people still exists; and the country they inhabited is called the Cimbric Chersonesus, or Peninsula; comprehending Jutland, Sleswig, and Holstein. The renown and various fortune of the Cimbri is briefly, but accurately, related by Mallet in the "Introduction" to the "History of Denmark."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_192"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">192</FONT></A> Though at this time they were greatly reduced by migrations, inundations and wars, they afterwards revived; and from this storehouse of nations came forth the Franks, Saxons, Normans, and various other tribes, which brought all Europe under Germanic sway.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_193"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">193</FONT></A> Their fame spread through Germany, Gaul, Spain, Britain, Italy, and as far as the Sea of Azoph (Palus Maeotis), whither, according to Posidonius, they penetrated, and called the Cimmerian or Cimbrian Bosphorus after their own name.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_194"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">194</FONT></A> This is usually, and probably rightly, explained as relating to both shores of the Cimbric Chersonesus. Cluver and Dithmar, however, suppose that these encampments are to be sought for either in Italy, upon the river Athesis (Adige), or in Narbonnensian Gaul near Aquae Sextiae (Aix in Provence), where Florus (iii. 3) mentions that the Teutoni defeated by Marius took post in a valley with a river running through it. Of the prodigious numbers of the Cimbri who made this terrible irruption we have an account in Plutarch, who relates that their fighting men were 300,000, with a much greater number of women and children. (Plut. Marius, p. 411.)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_195"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">195</FONT></A> Nerva was consul the fourth time, and Trajan the second, in the 85lst year of Rome; in which Tacitus composed this treatise.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_197"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">197</FONT></A> The Epitome of Livy informs us, that "in the year of Rome 640, the Cimbri, a wandering tribe, made a predatory incursion into Illyricum, where they routed the consul Papirius Carbo with his army." According to Strabo, it was at Noreia, a town of the Taurisci, near Aquileia, that Carbo was defeated. In the succeeding years, the Cimbri and Teutonia ravaged Gaul, and brought great calamities on that country; but at length, deterred by the unshaken bravery of the Gauls, they turned another way; as appears from Caesar, Bell. Gal. vii. 17. They then came into Italy, and sent ambassadors to the Senate, demanding lands to settle on. This was refused; and the consul M. Junius Silanus fought an unsuccessful battle with them, in the year of Rome 645. (Epitome of Livy, lxv.)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_198"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">198</FONT></A> "L. Cassius the consul, in the year of Rome 647, was cut off with his army in the confines of the Allobroges, by the Tigurine Gauls, a canton of the Helvetians (now the cantons of Zurich, Appenzell, Schaffhausen, &amp;c.), who had migrated from their settlements. The soldiers who survived the slaughter gave hostages for the payment of half they were worth, to be dismissed with safety." (Ibid.) Caesar further relates that the Roman army was passed under the yoke by the Tigurini:--"This single canton, migrating from home, within the memory of our fathers, slew the consul L. Cassius, and passed his army under the yoke."--Bell. Gall. i. 12.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_199"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">199</FONT></A> M. Aurelius Scaurus, the consul's lieutenant (or rather consul, as he appears to have served that office in the year of Rome 646), was defeated and taken by the Cimbri; and when, being asked his advice, he dissuaded them from passing the Alps into Italy, assuring them the Romans were invincible, he was slain by a furious youth, named Boiorix. (Epit. Livy, lxvii.)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_200"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">200</FONT></A> Florus, in like manner, considers these two affairs separately:--"Neither could Silanus sustain the first onset of the barbarians; nor Manlius, the second; nor Caepio, the third." (iii. 3.) Livy joins them together:--"By the same enemy (the Cimbri) Cn. Manlius the consul, and Q. Servilius Caepio the proconsul, were defeated in an engagement, and both dispossessed of their camps." (Epit. lxvii.) Paulus Orosius relates the affair more particularly:--"Manlius the consul, and Q. Caepio, proconsul, being sent against the Cimbri, Teutones, Tigurini, and Ambronae, Gaulish and German nations, who had conspired to extinguish the Roman empire, divided their respective provinces by the river Rhone. Here, the most violent dissensions prevailing between them, they were both overcome, to the great disgrace and danger of the Roman name. According to Antias, 80,000 Romans and allies were slaughtered. Caepio, by whose rashness this misfortune was occasioned, was condemned, and his property confiscated by order of the Roman people." (Lib. v. 16.) This happened in the year of Rome 649; and the anniversary was reckoned among the unlucky days.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_202"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">202</FONT></A> This tragical catastrophe so deeply affected Augustus, that, as Seutonius informs us, "he was said to have let his beard and hair grow for several months; during which he at times struck his head against the doors, crying out, 'Varus, restore my legions!' and ever after kept the anniversary as a day of mourning." (Aug. s. 23.) The finest history piece, perhaps, ever drawn by a writer, is Tacitus's description of the army of Germanicus visiting the field of battle, six years after, and performing funeral obsequies to the scattered remains of their slaughtered countrymen. (Annals, i. 61.)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_203"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">203</FONT></A> "After so many misfortunes, the Roman people thought no general so capable of repelling such formidable enemies, as Marius." Nor was the public opinion falsified. In his fourth consulate, in the year of Rome 652. "Marius engaged the Teutoni beyond the Alps near Aquae Sextiae (Aix in Province), killing, on the day of battle and the following day, above 150,000 of the enemy, and entirely cutting off the Teutonic nation." (Velleus Paterculus, ii. 12.) Livy says there were 200,000 slain, and 90,000 taken prisoners. The succeeding year he defeated the Cimbri, who had penetrated into Italy and crossed the Adige, in the Raudian plain, where now is Rubio, killing and taking prisoners upwards of 100,000 men. That he did not, however, obtain an unbought victory over this warlike people, may be conjectured from the resistance he met with even from their women. We are told by Florus (iii. 3) that "he was obliged to sustain an engagement with their wives, as well as themselves; who, entrenching themselves on all sides with wagons and cars, fought from them, as from towers, with lances and poles. Their death was no less glorious than their resistance. For, when they could not obtain from Marius what they requested by an embassy, their liberty, and admission into the vestal priesthood (which, indeed, could not lawfully be granted); after strangling their infants, they either fell by mutual wounds, or hung themselves on trees or the poles of their carriages in ropes made of their own hair. King Boiorix was slain, not unrevenged, fighting bravely in the field." On account of these great victories, Marius, in the year of Borne 652, triumphed over the Teutoni, Ambroni, and Cimbri.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_204"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">204</FONT></A> In the 596th year of Rome, Julius Caesar defeated Ariovistus, a German king, near Dampierre in the Franche-Comte, and pursued his routed troops with great slaughter thirty miles towards the Rhine, filling all that space with spoils and dead bodies. (Bell. Gall. i. 33 and 52.) He had before chastised the Tigurini, who, as already mentioned, had defeated and killed L. Cassius. Drusus: This was the son of Livia, and brother of the emperor Tiberius. He was in Germany B.C. 12, 11. His loss was principally from shipwreck on the coast of the Chauci. See Lynam's Roman Emperors, i. 37, 45, Nero; <i>i.e.</i> Tiberius, afterwards emperor. His name was Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero. See Lynam's Roman Emperors, i. 51, 53, 62, 78. Germanicus: He was the son of Drusus, and so nephew of Tiberius. His victories in Germany took place A.D. 14-16. He too, like his father, was shipwrecked, and nearly at the same spot.

When conquered and driven beyond the Elbe by Tiberius, they occupied that part of the country where are now Prignitz, Ruppin, and part of the Middle Marche. They afterwards founded the Lombard kingdom in Italy; which, in the year of Christ 774, was destroyed by Charlemagne, who took their king Desiderius, and subdued all Italy. The laws of the Langobardi are still extant, and may be met with in Lindenbrog. The Burgundians are not mentioned by Tacitus, probably because they were then an inconsiderable people. Afterwards, joining with the Langobardi, they settled on the Decuman lands and the Roman boundary. They from thence made an irruption into Gaul, and seized that country which is still named from them Burgundy. Their laws are likewise extant.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_211"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">211</FONT></A> From Tacitus's description, the Reudigni must have dwelt in part of the present duchy of Mecklenburg, and of Lauenburg. They had formerly been settled on this side the Elbe, on the sands of Luneburg.</p>

From their vicinity to the fore-mentioned nations, they must have inhabited part of the duchy of Mecklenburg.

<p><A NAME="xref_214"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">214</FONT></A> From the enumeration of Tacitus, and the situation of the other tribes, it appears that the Eudoses must have occupied the modern Wismar and Rostock; the Suardones, Stralsund, Swedish Pomerania, and part of the Hither Pomerania, and of the Uckerane Marche. Eccard, however, supposes these nations were much more widely extended; and that the Eudoses dwelt upon the Oder; the Suardones, upon the Warte; the Nuithones, upon the Netze.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_216"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">216</FONT></A> Many suppose this island to have been the isle of Rugen in the Baltic sea. It is more probable, however, that it was an island near the mouth of the Elbe, now called the isle of Helgeland, or Heiligeland (Holy Island). Besides the proof arising from the name, the situation agrees better with that of the nations before enumerated.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_217"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">217</FONT></A> Olaus Rudbeck contends that this festival was celebrated in winter, and still continues in Scandinavia under the appellation of Julifred, the peace of Juul. (Yule is the term used for Christmas season in the old English and Scottish dialects.) But this feast was solemnized not in honor of the Earth, but of the Sun, called by them Thor or Taranium. The festival of Herth was held later, in the month of February; as may be seen in Mallet's "Introduction to the History of Denmark."</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_218"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">218</FONT></A> <i>Templo</i> here means merely "the consecrated place," <i>i.e.</i> the grove before mentioned, for according to c.9 the Germans built no temples.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_219"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">219</FONT></A> It is supposed that this people, on account of their valor, were called Heermanner; corrupted by the Romans into Hermunduri. They were first settled between the Elbe, the Sala, and Bohemia; where now are Anhalt, Voightland, Saxony, part of Misnia, and of Franconia. Afterwards, when the Marcomanni took possession of Bohemia, from which the Boii had been expelled by Maroboduus, the Hermunduri added their settlements to their own, and planted in them the Suevian name, whence is derived the modern appellation of that country, Suabia.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_220"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">220</FONT></A> They were so at that time; but afterwards joined with the Marcomanni and other Germans against the Romans in the time of Marcus Aurelius, who overcame them.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_222"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">222</FONT></A> Tacitus is greatly mistaken if he confounds the source of the Egra, which is in the country of the Hermuduri, with that of the Elbe, which rises in Bohemia. The Elbe had been formerly, as Tacitus observes, well known to the Romans by the victories of Drusus, Tiberius, and Domitius; but afterwards, when the increasing power of the Germans kept the Roman arms at a distance, it was only indistinctly heard of. Hence its source was probably inaccurately laid down in the Roman geographical tables. Perhaps, however, the Hermunduri, when they had served in the army of Maroboduus, received lands in that part of Bohemia in which the Elbe rises; in which case there would be no mistake in Tacitus's account.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_225"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">225</FONT></A> Inhabitants of Moravia, and the part of Austria between it and the Danube. Of this people, Ammianus Marcellinus, in his account of the reign of Valentinian and Valens, thus speaks:--"A sudden commotion arose among the Quadi; a nation at present of little consequence, but which was formerly extremely warlike and potent, as their exploits sufficiently evince."--xxix. 15.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_226"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">226</FONT></A> Their expulsion of the Boii, who had given name to Bohemia, has been already mentioned. Before this period, the Marcomanni dwelt near the sources of the Danube, where now is the duchy of Wirtemburg; and, as Dithmar supposes, on account of their inhabiting the borders of Germany, were called Marcmanner, from <i>Marc</i> (the same with the old English <i>March</i>) a border, or boundary.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_227"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">227</FONT></A> These people justified their military reputation by the dangerous war which, in conjunction with the Marcomanni, they excited against the Romans, in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_228"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">228</FONT></A> Of this prince, and his alliance with the Romans against Arminius, mention is made by Tacitus, Annals, ii.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_229"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">229</FONT></A> Thus Vannius was made king of the Quadi by Tiberius. (See Annals, ii. 63.) At a later period, Antoninus Pius (as appears from a medal preserved in Spanheim) gave them Furtius for their king. And when they had expelled him, and set Ariogaesus on the throne, Marcus Aurelius, to whom he was obnoxious, refused to confirm the election. (Dio, lxxi.)</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_235"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">235</FONT></A> Ptolemy mentions iron mines in or near the country of the Quadi. I should imagine that the expression "additional disgrace" (or, more literally, "which might make them more ashamed") does not refer merely to the slavery of working in mines, but to the circumstance of their digging up iron, the substance by means of which they might acquire freedom and independence. This is quite in the manner of Tacitus. The word <i>iron</i> was figuratively used by the ancients to signify military force in general. Thus Solon, in his well-known answer to Croesus, observed to him, that the nation which possessed more iron would be master of all his gold.--<i>Aikin</i>.</p>

A kind of religious veneration is still paid to this phenomenon by the Roman Catholics, under the appellation of the fire of St. Elmo. The Naharvali seem to have affixed the same character of divinity on the <i>ignis fatuus</i>; and the name Alcis is probably the same with that of Alff or Alp, which the northern nations still apply to the fancied Genii of the mountains. The Sarmatian deities Lebus and Polebus, the memory of whom still subsists in the Polish festivals, had, perhaps, the same origin.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_242"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">242</FONT></A> These people were settled on the shore of the Baltic, where now are Colburg, Cassubia, and Further Pomerania. Their name is still preserved in the town of Rugenwald and Isle of Rugen.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_243"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">243</FONT></A> These were also settlers on the Baltic, about the modern Stolpe, Dantzig, and Lauenburg. The Heruli appear afterwards to have occupied the settlements of the Lemovii. Of these last no further mention occurs; but the Heruli made themselves famous throughout Europe and Asia, and were the first of the Germans who founded a kingdom in Italy under Odoacer.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_244"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">244</FONT></A> The Suiones inhabited Sweden, and the Danish isles of Funen, Langlaud, Zeeland, Laland, &amp;c. From them and the Cimbri were derived the Normans, who, after spreading terror through various parts of the empire, at last seized upon the fertile province of Normandy in France. The names of Goths, Visigoths, and Ostrogoths, became still more famous, they being the nations who accomplished the ruin of the Roman empire. The laws of the Visigoths are still extant; but they depart much from the usual simplicity of the German laws.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_245"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">245</FONT></A> The Romans, who had but an imperfect knowledge of this part of the world, imagined here those "vast insular tracts" mentioned in the beginning of this treatise. Hence Pliny, also, says of the Baltic sea (Codanus sinus), that "it is filled with islands, the most famous of which, Scandinavia (now Sweden and Norway), is of an undiscovered magnitude; that part of it only being known which is occupied by the Hilleviones, a nation inhabiting five hundred cantons; who call this country another globe." (Lib. iv. 13.) The memory of the Hilleviones is still preserved in the part of Sweden named Halland.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_246"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">246</FONT></A> Their naval power continued so great, that they had the glory of framing the nautical code, the laws of which were first written at Wisby, the capital of the isle of Gothland, in the eleventh century.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_248"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">248</FONT></A> The great opulence of a temple of the Suiones, as described by Adam of Bremen (Eccl. Hist. ch. 233), is a proof of the wealth that at all times has attended naval dominion. "This nation," says he, "possesses a temple of great renown, called Ubsola (now Upsal), not far from the cities Sictona and Birca (now Sigtuna and Bioerkoe). In this temple, which is entirely ornamented with gold, the people worship the statues of three gods; the most powerful of whom, Thor, is seated on a couch in the middle; with Woden on one side, and Fricca on the other." From the ruins of the towns Sictona and Birca arose the present capital of Sweden, Stockholm.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_249"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">249</FONT></A> Hence Spener (Notit. German. Antiq.) rightly concludes that the crown was hereditary, and not elective, among the Suiones.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_250"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">250</FONT></A> It is uncertain whether what is now called the Frozen Ocean is here meant, or the northern extremities of the Baltic Sea, the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland, which are so frozen every winter as to be unnavigable.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_251"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">251</FONT></A> The true principles of astronomy have now taught us the reason why, at a certain latitude, the sun, at the summer solstice, appears never to set: and at a lower latitude, the evening twilight continues till morning.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_252"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">252</FONT></A> The true reading here is, probably, "immerging;" since it was a common notion at that period, that the descent of the sun into the ocean was attended with a kind of hissing noise, like red hot iron dipped into water. Thus Juvenal, Sat. xiv, 280:--</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_259"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">259</FONT></A> Many vestiges of this superstition remain to this day in Sweden. The peasants, in the month of February, the season formerly sacred to Frea, make little images of boars in paste, which they apply to various superstitious uses. (See Eccard.) A figure of a Mater Deum, with the boar, is given by Mr. Pennant, in his Tour in Scotland, 1769, p. 268, engraven from a stone found at the great station at Netherby in Cumberland.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_260"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">260</FONT></A> The cause of this was, probably, their confined situation, which did not permit them to wander in hunting and plundering parties, like the rest of the Germans.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_261"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">261</FONT></A> This name was transferred to <i>glass</i> when it came into use. Pliny speaks of the production of amber in this country as follows:--"It is certain that amber is produced in the islands of the Northern Ocean, and is called by the Germans <i>gless</i>. One of these islands, by the natives named Austravia, was on this account called Glessaria by our sailors in the fleet of Germanicus."--Lib. xxxvii. 3.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_262"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">262</FONT></A> Much of the Prussian amber is even at present collected on the shores of the Baltic. Much also is found washed out of the clayey cliffs of Holderness. See Tour in Scotland, 1769, p. 16.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_263"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">263</FONT></A> Insomuch that the Guttones, who formerly inhabited this coast, made use of amber as fuel, and sold it for that purpose to the neighboring Teutones. (Plin. xxxvii. 2.)</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_264"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">264</FONT></A> Various toys and utensils of amber, such as bracelets, necklaces, rings, cups, and even pillars, were to be met with among the luxurious Romans.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_265"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">265</FONT></A> In a work by Goeppert and Berendt, on "Amber and the Fossil Remains of Plants contained in it," published at Berlin, 1845, a passage is found (of which a translation is here given) which quite harmonizes with the account of Tacitus:--"About the parts which are known by the name of Samland an island emerged, or rather a group of islands, ... which gradually increased in circumference, and, favored by a mild sea climate, was overspread with vegetation and forest. This forest was the means of amber being produced. Certain trees in it exuded gums in such quantities that the sunken forest soil now appears to be filled with it to such a degree, as if it had only been deprived of a very trifling part of its contents by the later eruptions of the sea, and the countless storms which have lashed the ocean for centuries." Hence, though found underground, it appears to have been originally the production of some resinous tree. Hence, too, the reason of the appearance of insects, &amp;c. in it, as mentioned by Tacitus.</p>

<p><A NAME="xref_267"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">267</FONT></A> All beyond the Vistula was reckoned Sarmatia. These people, therefore, were properly inhabitants of Sarmatia, though from their manners they appeared of German origin.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_268"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">268</FONT></A> Pliny also reckons the Peucini among the German nations:--"The fifth part of Germany is possessed by the Peucini and Bastarnae, who border on the Dacians." (iv. 14.) From Strabo it appears that the Peucini, part of the Bastarnae, inhabited the country about the mouths of the Danube, and particularly the island Peuce, now Piczina, formed by the river.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_269"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">269</FONT></A> The habitations of the Peucini were fixed; whereas the Sarmatians wandered about in their wagons.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_270"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">270</FONT></A> "Sordes omnium ac torpor; procerum connubiis mixtis nonnihil in Sarmatarum habitum foedantur." In many editions the semicolon is placed not after <i>torpor</i>, but after <i>procerum</i>. The sense of the passage so read is: "The chief men are lazy and stupid, besides being filthy, like all the rest. Intermarriage with the Sarmatians have debased." &amp;c.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_271"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">271</FONT></A> The Venedi extended beyond the Peucini and Bastarnae as far as the Baltic Sea; where is the Sinus Venedicus, now the Gulf of Dantzig. Their name is also preserved in Wenden, a part of Livonia. When the German nations made their irruption into Italy, France and Spain, the Venedi, also called Winedi, occupied their vacant settlements between the Vistula and Elbe. Afterwards they crossed the Danube, and seized Dalmatia, Illyricum, Istria, Carniola, and the Noric Alps. A part of Carniola still retains the name of Windismarck, derived from them. This people were also called Slavi; and their language, the Sclavonian, still prevails through a vast tract of country.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_272"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">272</FONT></A> This is still the manner of living of the successors of the Sarmatians, the Nogai Tartars.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_273"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">273</FONT></A> Their country is called by Pliny, Eningia, now Finland. Warnefrid (De Gest. Langobard. i. 5) thus describes their savage and wretched state:--"The Scritobini, or Scritofinni, are not without snow in the midst of summer; and, being little superior in sagacity to the brutes, live upon no other food than the raw flesh of wild animals, the hairy skins of which they use for clothing. They derive their name, according to the barbarian tongue, from leaping, because they hunt wild beasts by a certain method of leaping or springing with pieces of wood bent in the shape of a bow." Here is an evident description of the snow-shoes or raquets in common use among the North American savages, as well as the inhabitants of the most northern parts of Europe.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_274"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">274</FONT></A> As it is just after mentioned that their chief dependence is on the game procured in hunting, this can only mean that the vegetable food they use consists of wild herbs, in opposition to the cultivated products of the earth.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_275"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">275</FONT></A> The Esquimaux and the South Sea islanders do the same thing to this day.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_276"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">276</FONT></A> People of Lapland. The origin of this fable was probably the manner of clothing in these cold regions, where the inhabitants bury themselves in the thickest furs, scarcely leaving anything of the form of a human creature.</p>  
<p><A NAME="xref_277"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">277</FONT></A> It is with true judgment that this excellent historian forbears to intermix fabulous narrations with the very interesting and instructive matter of this treatise. Such a mixture might have brought an impeachment on the fidelity of the account in general; which, notwithstanding the suspicions professed by some critics, contains nothing but what is entirely consonant to truth and nature. Had Tacitus indulged his invention in the description of German manners, is it probable that he could have given so just a picture of the state of a people under similar circumstances, the savage tribes of North America, as we have seen them within the present century? Is it likely that his relations would have been so admirably confirmed by the codes of law still extant of the several German nations; such as the Salic, Ripuary, Burgundian, English and Lombard? or that after the course of so many centuries, and the numerous changes of empire, the customs, laws and manners he describes should still be traced in all the various people of German derivation? As long as the original constitution and jurisprudence of our own and other European countries are studied, this treatise will be regarded as one of the most precious and authentic monuments of historical antiquity. </p>  </div>  </BODY>
