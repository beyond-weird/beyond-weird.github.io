<p>7. In the election of kings they have regard to birth; in that of generals, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_50"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">50</FONT></A> to valor. Their kings have not an absolute or unlimited power; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_51"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">51</FONT></A> and their generals command less through the force of authority, than of example. If they are daring, adventurous, and conspicuous in action, they procure obedience from the admiration they inspire. None, however, but the priests &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_52"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">52</FONT></A> are permitted to judge offenders, to inflict bonds or stripes; so that chastisement appears not as an act of military discipline, but as the instigation of the god whom they suppose present with warriors. They also carry with them to battle certain images and standards taken from the sacred groves. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_53"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">53</FONT></A> It is a principal incentive to their courage, that their squadrons and battalions are not formed by men fortuitously collected, but by the assemblage of families and clans. Their pledges also are near at hand; they have within hearing the yells of their women, and the cries of their children. These, too, are the most revered witnesses of each man's conduct, these his most liberal applauders. To their mothers and their wives they bring their wounds for relief, nor do these dread to count or to search out the gashes. The women also administer food and encouragement to those who are fighting.</p>
