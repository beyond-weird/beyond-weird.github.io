<p>6. Even iron is not plentiful &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_38"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">38</FONT></A> among them; as may be inferred from the nature of their weapons. Swords or broad lances are seldom used; but they generally carry a spear, (called in their language <i>framea</i>, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_39"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">39</FONT></A>) which has an iron blade, short and narrow, but so sharp and manageable, that, as occasion requires, they employ it either in close or distant fighting. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_40"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">40</FONT></A> This spear and a shield are all the armor of the cavalry. The foot have, besides, missile weapons, several to each man, which they hurl to an immense distance. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_41"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">41</FONT></A> They are either naked, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_42"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> or lightly covered with a small mantle; and have no pride in equipage: their shields only are ornamented with the choicest colors. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_43"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">43</FONT></A> Few are provided with a coat of mail; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_44"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">44</FONT></A> and scarcely here and there one with a casque or helmet. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_45"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">45</FONT></A> Their horses are neither remarkable for beauty nor swiftness, nor are they taught the various evolutions practised with us. The cavalry either bear down straight forwards, or wheel once to the right, in so compact a body that none is left behind the rest. Their principal strength, on the whole, consists in their infantry: hence in an engagement these are intermixed with the cavalry; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_46"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">46</FONT></A> so Well accordant with the nature of equestrian combats is the agility of those foot soldiers, whom they select from the whole body of their youth, and place in the front of the line. Their number, too, is determined; a hundred from each canton: &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_47"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">47</FONT></A> and they are distinguished at home by a name expressive of this circumstance; so that what at first was only an appellation of number, becomes thenceforth a title of honor. Their line of battle is disposed in wedges. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_48"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">48</FONT></A> To give ground, provided they rally again, is considered rather as a prudent strategem, than cowardice. They carry off their slain even while the battle remains undecided. The greatest disgrace that can befall them is to have abandoned their shields. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_49"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">49</FONT></A> A person branded with this ignominy is not permitted to join in their religious rites, or enter their assemblies; so that many, after escaping from battle, have put an end to their infamy by the halter.</p>
