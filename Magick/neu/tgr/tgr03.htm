<p>3. A peculiar kind of verses is also current among them, by the recital of which, termed "barding," &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_27"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> they stimulate their courage; while the sound itself serves as an augury of the event of the impending combat. For, according to the nature of the cry proceeding from the line, terror is inspired or felt: nor does it seem so much an articulate song, as the wild chorus of valor. A harsh, piercing note, and a broken roar, are the favorite tones; which they render more full and sonorous by applying their mouths to their shields. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_28"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">28</FONT></A> Some conjecture that Ulysses, in the course of his long and fabulous wanderings, was driven into this ocean, and landed in Germany; and that Asciburgium, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_29"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">29</FONT></A> a place situated on the Rhine, and at this day inhabited, was founded by him, and named <i>Askipurgion</i>. They pretend that an altar was formerly discovered here, consecrated to Ulysses, with the name of his father Laertes subjoined; and that certain monuments and tombs, inscribed with Greek characters, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_30"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">30</FONT></A> are still extant upon the confines of Germany and Rhaetia. These allegations I shall neither attempt to confirm nor to refute: let every one believe concerning them as he is disposed.</p>
