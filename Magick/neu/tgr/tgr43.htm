<p>43. Behind these are the Marsigni, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_230"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">230</FONT></A> Gothini, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_231"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">231</FONT></A> Osi, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_232"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">232</FONT></A> and Burrii, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_233"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">233</FONT></A> who close the rear of the Marcomanni and Quadi. Of these, the Marsigni and Burrii in language &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_234"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">234</FONT></A> and dress resemble the Suevi. The Gothini and Osi prove themselves not to be Germans; the first, by their use of the Gallic, the second, of the Pannonian tongue; and both, by their submitting to pay tribute: which is levied on them, as aliens, partly by the Sarmatians, partly by the Quadi. The Gothini, to their additional disgrace, work iron mines. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_235"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">235</FONT></A> All these people inhabit but a small proportion of champaign country; their settlements are chiefly amongst forests, and on the sides and summits of mountains; for a continued ridge of mountains &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_236"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">236</FONT></A> separates Suevia from various remoter tribes. Of these, the Lygian &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_237"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">237</FONT></A> is the most extensive, and diffuses its name through several communities. It will be sufficient to name the most powerful of them--the Arii, Helvecones, Manimi, Elysii, and Naharvali. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_238"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">238</FONT></A> In the country of the latter is a grove, consecrated to religious rites of great antiquity. A priest presides over them, dressed in woman's apparel; but the gods worshipped there are said, according to the Roman interpretation, to be Castor and Pollux. Their attributes are the same; their name, Alcis. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_239"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">239</FONT></A> No images, indeed, or vestiges of foreign superstition, appear in their worship; but they are revered under the character of young men and brothers. The Arii, fierce beyond the superiority of strength they possess over the other just enumerated people, improve their natural ferocity of aspect by artificial helps. Their shields are black; their bodies painted: &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_240"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">240</FONT></A> they choose the darkest nights for an attack; and strike terror by the funereal gloom of their sable bands--no enemy being able to sustain their singular, and, as it were, infernal appearance; since in every combat the eyes are the first part subdued. Beyond the Lygii are the Gothones, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_241"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">241</FONT></A> who live under a monarchy, somewhat more strict than that of the other German nations, yet not to a degree incompatible with liberty. Adjoining to these are the Rugii &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_242"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">242</FONT></A> and Lemovii, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_243"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">243</FONT></A> situated on the sea-coast--all these tribes are distinguished by round shields, short swords, and submission to regal authority.</p>
