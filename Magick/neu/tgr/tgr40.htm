<p>40. The Langobardi, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_210"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">210</FONT></A> on the other hand, are ennobled by, the smallness of their numbers; since though surrounded by many powerful nations, they derive security, not from obsequiousness, but from their martial enterprise. The neighboring Reudigni, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_211"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">211</FONT></A> and the Avions, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_212"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">212</FONT></A> Angli, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_213"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">213</FONT></A> Varini, Eudoses, Suardones, and Nuithones, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_214"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">214</FONT></A> are defended by rivers or forests. Nothing remarkable occurs in any of these; except that they unite in the worship of Hertha, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_215"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">215</FONT></A> or Mother Earth; and suppose her to interfere in the affairs of men, and to visit the different nations. In an island &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_216"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">216</FONT></A> of the ocean stands a sacred and unviolated grove, in which is a consecrated chariot, covered with a veil, which the priest alone is permitted to touch. He becomes conscious of the entrance of the goddess into this secret recess; and with profound veneration attends the vehicle, which is drawn by yoked cows. At this season, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_217"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">217</FONT></A> all is joy; and every place which the goddess deigns to visit is a scene of festivity. No wars are undertaken; arms are untouched; and every hostile weapon is shut up. Peace abroad and at home are then only known; then only loved; till at length the same priest reconducts the goddess, satiated with mortal intercourse, to her temple. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_218"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">218</FONT></A> The chariot, with its curtain, and, if we may believe it, the goddess herself, then undergo ablution in a secret lake. This office is performed by slaves, whom the same lake instantly swallows up. Hence proceeds a mysterious horror; and a holy ignorance of what that can be, which is beheld only by those who are about to perish. This part of the Suevian nation extends to the most remote recesses of Germany.</p>
