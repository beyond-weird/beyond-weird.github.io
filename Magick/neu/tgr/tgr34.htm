<p>34. Contiguous to the Angrivarii and Chamavi backwards lie the Dulgibini, Chasauri, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_180"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">180</FONT></A> and other nations less known. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_181"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">181</FONT></A> In front, the Frisii &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_182"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">182</FONT></A> succeed; who are distinguished by the appellations of Greater and Lesser, from their proportional power. The settlements of both stretch along the border of the Rhine to the ocean; and include, besides, vast lakes, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_183"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">183</FONT></A> which have been navigated by Roman fleets. We have even explored the ocean itself on that side; and fame reports that columns of Hercules &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_184"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">184</FONT></A> are still remaining on that coast; whether it be that Hercules was ever there in reality, or that whatever great and magnificent is anywhere met with is, by common consent, ascribed to his renowned name. The attempt of Drusus Germanicus &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_185"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">185</FONT></A> to make discoveries in these parts was sufficiently daring; but the ocean opposed any further inquiry into itself and Hercules. After a while no one renewed the attempt; and it was thought more pious and reverential to believe the actions of the gods, than to investigate them.</p>
