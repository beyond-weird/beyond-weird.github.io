<p>45. Beyond the Suiones is another sea, sluggish and almost stagnant, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_250"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">250</FONT></A> by which the whole globe is imagined to be girt and enclosed, from this circumstance, that the last light of the setting sun continues so vivid till its rising, as to obscure the stars. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_251"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">251</FONT></A> Popular belief adds, that the sound of his emerging &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_252"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">252</FONT></A> from the ocean is also heard; and the forms of deities, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_253"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">253</FONT></A> with the rays beaming from his head, are beheld. Only thus far, report says truly, does nature extend. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_254"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">254</FONT></A> On the right shore of the Suevic sea &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_255"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">255</FONT></A> dwell the tribes of the Aestii, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_256"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">256</FONT></A> whose dress and customs are the same with those of the Suevi, but their language more resembles the British. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_257"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">257</FONT></A> They worship the mother of the gods; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_258"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">258</FONT></A> and as the symbol of their superstition, they carry about them the figures of wild boars. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_250"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">250</FONT></A> This serves them in place of armor and every other defence: it renders the votary of the goddess safe even in the midst of foes. Their weapons are chiefly clubs, iron being little used among them. They cultivate corn and other fruits of the earth with more industry than German indolence commonly exerts. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_260"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">260</FONT></A> They even explore the sea; and are the only people who gather amber, which by them is called <i>Glese</i>, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_261"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">261</FONT></A> and is collected among the shallows and upon the shore. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_262"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">262</FONT></A> With the usual indifference of barbarians, they have not inquired or ascertained from what natural object or by what means it is produced. It long lay disregarded &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_263"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">263</FONT></A> amidst other things thrown up by the sea, till our luxury &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_264"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">264</FONT></A> gave it a name. Useless to them, they gather it in the rough; bring it unwrought; and wonder at the price they receive. It would appear, however, to be an exudation from certain trees; since reptiles, and even winged animals, are often seen shining through it, which, entangled in it while in a liquid state, became enclosed as it hardened. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_264"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">264</FONT></A> I should therefore imagine that, as the luxuriant woods and groves in the secret recesses of the East exude frankincense and balsam, so there are the same in the islands and continents of the West; which, acted upon by the near rays of the sun, drop their liquid juices into the subjacent sea, whence, by the force of tempests, they are thrown out upon the opposite coasts. If the nature of amber be examined by the application of fire, it kindles like a torch, with a thick and odorous flame; and presently resolves into a glutinous matter resembling pitch or resin. The several communities of the Sitones &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_266"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">266</FONT></A> succeed those of the Suiones; to whom they are similar in other respects, but differ in submitting to a female reign; so far have they degenerated, not only from liberty, but even from slavery. Here Suevia terminates.</p>
