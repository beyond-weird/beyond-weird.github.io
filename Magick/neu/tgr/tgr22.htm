<p>22. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_129"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">129</FONT></A> [Their manner of living with their guest is easy and affable] As soon as they arise from sleep, which they generally protract till late in the day, they bathe, usually in warm water, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_130"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">130</FONT></A> as cold weather chiefly prevails there. After bathing they take their meal, each on a distinct seat, and a a separate table. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_131"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">131</FONT></A> Then they proceed, armed, to business, and not less frequently to convivial parties, in which it is no disgrace to pass days and nights, without intermission, in drinking. The frequent quarrels that arise amongst them, when intoxicated, seldom terminate in abusive language, but more frequently in blood. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_132"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">132</FONT></A> In their feasts, they generally deliberate on the reconcilement of enemies, on family alliances, on the appointment of chiefs, and finally on peace and war; conceiving that at no time the soul is more opened to sincerity, or warmed to heroism. These people, naturally void of artifice or disguise, disclose the most secret emotions of their hearts in the freedom of festivity. The minds of all being thus displayed without reserve, the subjects of their deliberation are again canvassed the next day; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_133"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">133</FONT></A> and each time has its advantages. They consult when unable to dissemble; they determine when not liable to mistake.</p>
