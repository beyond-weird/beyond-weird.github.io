<p>13. The Germans transact no business, public or private, without being armed: &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_84"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">84</FONT></A> but it is not customary for any person to assume arms till the state has approved his ability to use them. Then, in the midst of the assembly, either one of the chiefs, or the father, or a relation, equips the youth with a shield and javelin. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_85"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">85</FONT></A> These are to them the manly gown; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_86"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">86</FONT></A> this is the first honor conferred on youth: before this they are considered as part of a household; afterwards, of the state. The dignity of chieftain is bestowed even on mere lads, whose descent is eminently illustrious, or whose fathers have performed signal services to the public; they are associated, however, with those of mature strength, who have already been declared capable of service; nor do they blush to be seen in the rank of companions. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_87"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">87</FONT></A> For the state of companionship itself has its several degrees, determined by the judgment of him whom they follow; and there is a great emulation among the companions, which shall possess the highest place in the favor of their chief; and among the chiefs, which shall excel in the number and valor of his companions. It is their dignity, their strength, to be always surrounded with a large body of select youth, an ornament in peace, a bulwark in war. And not in his own country alone, but among the neighboring states, the fame and glory of each chief consists in being distinguished for the number and bravery of his companions. Such chiefs are courted by embassies; distinguished by presents; and often by their reputation alone decide a war.</p>
