<p>46. I am in doubt whether to reckon the Peucini, Venedi, and Fenni among the Germans or Sarmatians; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_267"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">267</FONT></A> although the Peucini, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_268"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">268</FONT></A> who are by some called Bastarnae, agree with the Germans in language, apparel, and habitations. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_269"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">269</FONT></A> All of them live in filth and laziness. The intermarriages of their chiefs with the Sarmatians have debased them by a mixture of the manners of that people. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_270"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">270</FONT></A> The Venedi have drawn much from this source; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_271"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">271</FONT></A> for they overrun in their predatory excursions all the woody and mountainous tracts between the Peucini and Fenni. Yet even these are rather to be referred to the Germans, since they build houses, carry shields, and travel with speed on foot; in all which particulars they totally differ from the Sarmatians, who pass their time in wagons and on horseback. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_272"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">272</FONT></A> The Fenni &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_273"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">273</FONT></A> live in a state of amazing savageness and squalid poverty. They are destitute of arms, horses, and settled abodes: their food is herbs; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_274"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">274</FONT></A> their clothing, skins; their bed, the ground. Their only dependence is on their arrows, which, for want of iron, are headed with bone; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_275"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">275</FONT></A> and the chase is the support of the women as well as the men; the former accompany the latter in the pursuit, and claim a share of the prey. Nor do they provide any other shelter for their infants from wild beasts and storms, than a covering of branches twisted together. This is the resort of youth; this is the receptacle of old age. Yet even this way of life is in their estimation happier than groaning over the plough; toiling in the erection of houses; subjecting their own fortunes and those of others to the agitations of alternate hope and fear. Secure against men, secure against the gods, they have attained the most difficult point, not to need even a wish.</p>  
<p>All our further accounts are intermixed with fable; as, that the Hellusii and Oxionae &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_276"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">276</FONT></A> have human faces, with the bodies and limbs of wild beasts. These unauthenticated reports I shall leave untouched. [277]</p>
