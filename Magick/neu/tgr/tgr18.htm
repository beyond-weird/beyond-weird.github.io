<p>18. The matrimonial bond is, nevertheless, strict and severe among them; nor is there anything in their manners more commendable than this. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_106"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">106</FONT></A> Almost singly among the barbarians, they content themselves with one wife; a very few of them excepted, who, not through incontinence, but because their alliance is solicited on account of their rank, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_107"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">107</FONT></A> practise polygamy. The wife does not bring a dowry to her husband, but receives one from him. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_108"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">108</FONT></A> The parents and relations assemble, and pass their approbation on the presents--presents not adapted to please a female taste, or decorate the bride; but oxen, a caparisoned steed, a shield, spear, and sword. By virtue of these, the wife is espoused; and she in her turn makes a present of some arms to her husband. This they consider as the firmest bond of union; these, the sacred mysteries, the conjugal deities. That the woman may not think herself excused from exertions of fortitude, or exempt from the casualties of war, she is admonished by the very ceremonial of her marriage, that she comes to her husband as a partner in toils and dangers; to suffer and to dare equally with him, in peace and in war: this is indicated by the yoked oxen, the harnessed steed, the offered arms. Thus she is to live; thus to die. She receives what she is to return inviolate &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_109"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">109</FONT></A> and honored to her children; what her daughters-in-law are to receive, and again transmit to her grandchildren.</p>
