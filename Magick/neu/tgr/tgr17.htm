<p>17. The clothing common to all is a sagum &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_101"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">101</FONT></A> fastened by a clasp, or, in want of that, a thorn. With no other covering, they pass whole days on the hearth, before the fire. The more wealthy are distinguished by a vest, not flowing loose, like those of the Sarmatians and Parthians, but girt close, and exhibiting the shape of every limb. They also wear the skins of beasts, which the people near the borders are less curious in selecting or preparing than the more remote inhabitants, who cannot by commerce procure other clothing. These make choice of particular skins, which they variegate with spots, and strips of the furs of marine animals, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_102"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">102</FONT></A> the produce of the exterior ocean, and seas to us unknown. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_103"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">103</FONT></A> The dress of the women does not differ from that of the men; except that they more frequently wear linen, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_104"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">104</FONT></A> which they stain with purple; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_105"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">105</FONT></A> and do not lengthen their upper garment into sleeves, but leave exposed the whole arm, and part of the breast.</p>
