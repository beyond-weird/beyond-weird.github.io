<p>28. This is the sum of what I have been able to learn concerning the origin and manners of the Germans in general. I now proceed to mention those particulars in which they differ from each other; and likewise to relate what nations have migrated from Germany into Gaul. That great writer, the deified Julius, asserts that the Gauls were formerly the superior people; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_149"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">149</FONT></A> whence it is probable that some Gallic colonies passed over into Germany: for how small an obstacle would a river be to prevent any nation, as it increased in strength, from occupying or changing settlements as yet lying in common, and unappropriated by the power of monarchies! Accordingly, the tract betwixt the Hercynian forest and the rivers Rhine and Mayne was possessed by the Helvetii: &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_150"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">150</FONT></A> and that beyond, by the Boii; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_151"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">151</FONT></A> both Gallic tribes. The name of Boiemum still remains, a memorial of the ancient settlement, though its inhabitants are now changed. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_152"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">152</FONT></A> But whether the Aravisci &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_153"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">153</FONT></A> migrated into Pannonia from the Osi, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_154"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">154</FONT></A> a German nation; or the Osi into Germany from the Aravisci; the language, institutions, and manners of both being still the same, is a matter of uncertainty; for, in their pristine state of equal indigence and equal liberty, the same advantages and disadvantages were common to both sides of the river. The Treveri &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_155"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">155</FONT></A> and Nervii &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_156"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">156</FONT></A> are ambitious of being thought of German origin; as if the reputation of this descent would distinguish them from the Gauls, whom they resemble in person and effeminacy. The Vangiones, Triboci, and Nemetes, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_157"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">157</FONT></A> who inhabit the bank of the Rhine, are without doubt German tribes. Nor do the Ubii, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_158"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">158</FONT></A> although they have been thought worthy of being made a Roman colony, and are pleased in bearing the name of Agrippinenses from their founder, blush to acknowledge their origin from Germany; from whence they formerly migrated, and for their approved fidelity were settled on the bank of the Rhine, not that they might be guarded themselves, but that they might serve as a guard against invaders.</p>
