<p>29. Of all these people, the most famed for valor are the Batavi; whose territories comprise but a small part of the banks of the Rhine, but consist chiefly of an island within it. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_159"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">159</FONT></A> These were formerly a tribe of the Catti, who, on account of an intestine division, removed to their present settlements, in order to become a part of the Roman empire. They still retain this honor, together with a memorial of their ancient alliance; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_160"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">160</FONT></A> for they are neither insulted by taxes, nor oppressed by farmers of the revenue. Exempt from fiscal burthens and extraordinary contributions, and kept apart for military use alone, they are reserved, like a magazine of arms, for the purposes of war. The nation of the Mattiaci &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_161"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">161</FONT></A> is under a degree of subjection of the same kind: for the greatness of the Roman people has carried a reverence for the empire beyond the Rhine and the ancient limits. The Mattiaci, therefore, though occupying a settlement and borders &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_162"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">162</FONT></A> on the opposite side of the river, from sentiment and attachment act with us; resembling the Batavi in every respect, except that they are animated with a more vigorous spirit by the soil and air of their own country. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_163"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">163</FONT></A> I do not reckon among the people of Germany those who occupy the Decumate lands, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_164"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">164</FONT></A> although inhabiting between the Rhine and Danube. Some of the most fickle of the Gauls, rendered daring through indigence, seized upon this district of uncertain property. Afterwards, our boundary line being advanced, and a chain of fortified posts established, it became a skirt of the empire, and part of the Roman province. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_165"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">165</FONT></A></p>
