<p>35. Hitherto we have traced the western side of Germany. It turns from thence with a vast sweep to the north: and first occurs the country of the Chauci, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_186"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">186</FONT></A> which, though it begins immediately from Frisia, and occupies part of the seashore, yet stretches so far as to border on all the nations before mentioned, till it winds round so as to meet the territories of the Catti. This immense tract is not only possessed, but filled by the Chauci; a people the noblest of the Germans, who choose to maintain their greatness by justice rather than violence. Without ambition, without ungoverned desires, quiet and retired, they provoke no wars, they are guilty of no rapine or plunder; and it is a principal proof of their power and bravery, that the superiority they possess has not been acquired by unjust means. Yet all have arms in readiness; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_187"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">187</FONT></A> and, if necessary, an army is soon raised: for they abound in men and horses, and maintain their military reputation even in inaction.</p>
