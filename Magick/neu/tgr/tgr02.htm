<p>2. The people of Germany appear to me indigenous, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_12"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> and free from intermixture with foreigners, either as settlers or casual visitants. For the emigrants of former ages performed their expeditions not by land, but by water; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_13"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> and that immense, and, if I may so call it, hostile ocean, is rarely navigated by ships from our world. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_14"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> Then, besides the danger of a boisterous and unknown sea, who would relinquish Asia, Africa, or Italy, for Germany, a land rude in its surface, rigorous in its climate, cheerless to every beholder and cultivator, except a native? In their ancient songs, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_15"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> which are their only records or annals, they celebrate the god Tuisto, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_16"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> sprung from the earth, and his son Mannus, as the fathers and founders of their race. To Mannus they ascribe three sons, from whose names &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_17"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> the people bordering on the ocean are called Ingaevones; those inhabiting the central parts, Herminones; the rest, Istaevones. Some, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_18"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> however, assuming the licence of antiquity, affirm that there were more descendants of the god, from whom more appellations were derived; as those of the Marsi, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_19"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">19</FONT></A> Gambrivii, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_20"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> Suevi, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_21"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">21</FONT></A> and Vandali; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_22"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">22</FONT></A> and that these are the genuine and original names. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_23"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> That of Germany, on the other hand, they assert to be a modern addition; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_24"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">24</FONT></A> for that the people who first crossed the Rhine, and expelled the Gauls, and are now called Tungri, were then named Germans; which appellation of a particular tribe, not of a whole people, gradually prevailed; so that the title of Germans, first assumed by the victors in order to excite terror, was afterwards adopted by the nation in general. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_25"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">25</FONT></A> They have likewise the tradition of a Hercules &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_26"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">26</FONT></A> of their country, whose praises they sing before those of all other heroes as they advance to battle.</p>
