<p>20. In every house the children grow up, thinly and meanly clad, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_119"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">119</FONT></A> to that bulk of body and limb which we behold with wonder. Every mother suckles her own children, and does not deliver them into the hands of servants and nurses. No indulgence distinguishes the young master from the slave. They lie together amidst the same cattle, upon the same ground, till age &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_120"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">120</FONT></A> separates, and valor marks out, the free-born. The youths partake late of the pleasures of love, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_121"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">121</FONT></A> and hence pass the age of puberty unexhausted: nor are the virgins hurried into marriage; the same maturity, the same full growth is required: the sexes unite equally matched &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_122"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">122</FONT></A> and robust; and the children inherit the vigor of their parents. Children are regarded with equal affection by their maternal uncles &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_123"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">123</FONT></A> as by their fathers: some even consider this as the more sacred bond of consanguinity, and prefer it in the requisition of hostages, as if it held the mind by a firmer tie, and the family by a more extensive obligation. A person's own children, however, are his heirs and successors; and no wills are made. If there be no children, the next in order of inheritance are brothers, paternal and maternal uncles. The more numerous are a man's relations and kinsmen, the more comfortable is his old age; nor is it here any advantage to be childless. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_124"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">124</FONT></A></p>
