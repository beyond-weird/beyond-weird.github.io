<p>31. A custom followed among the other German nations only by a few individuals, of more daring spirit than the rest, is adopted by general consent among the Catti. From the time they arrive at years of maturity they let their hair and beard grow; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_170"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">170</FONT></A> and do not divest themselves of this votive badge, the promise of valor, till they have slain an enemy. Over blood and spoils they unveil the countenance, and proclaim that they have at length paid the debt of existence, and have proved themselves worthy of their country and parents. The cowardly and effeminate continue in their squalid disguise. The bravest among them wear also an iron ring &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_171"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">171</FONT></A> (a mark of ignominy in that nation) as a kind of chain, till they have released themselves by the slaughter of a foe. Many of the Catti assume this distinction, and grow hoary under the mark, conspicuous both to foes and friends. By these, in every engagement, the attack is begun: they compose the front line, presenting a new spectacle of terror. Even in peace they do not relax the sternness of their aspect. They have no house, land, or domestic cares: they are maintained by whomsoever they visit: lavish of another's property, regardless of their own; till the debility of age renders them unequal to such a rigid course of military virtue. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_172"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">172</FONT></A></p>
