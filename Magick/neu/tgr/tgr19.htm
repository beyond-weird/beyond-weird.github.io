<p>19. They live, therefore, fenced around with chastity; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_110"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">110</FONT></A> corrupted by no seductive spectacles, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_111"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">111</FONT></A> no convivial incitements. Men and women are alike unacquainted with clandestine correspondence. Adultery is extremely rare among so numerous a people. Its punishment is instant, and at the pleasure of the husband. He cuts off the hair &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_112"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">112</FONT></A> of the offender, strips her, and in presence of her relations expels her from his house, and pursues her with stripes through the whole village. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_113"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">113</FONT></A> Nor is any indulgence shown to a prostitute. Neither beauty, youth, nor riches can procure her a husband: for none there looks on vice with a smile, or calls mutual seduction the way of the world. Still more exemplary is the practice of those states &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_114"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">114</FONT></A> in which none but virgins marry, and the expectations and wishes of a wife are at once brought to a period. Thus, they take one husband as one body and one life; that no thought, no desire, may extend beyond him; and he may be loved not only as their husband, but as their marriage. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_115"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">115</FONT></A> To limit the increase of children, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_116"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">116</FONT></A> or put to death any of the later progeny &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_117"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">117</FONT></A> is accounted infamous: and good habits have there more influence than good laws elsewhere. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_118"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">118</FONT></A></p>
