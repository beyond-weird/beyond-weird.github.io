<p>16. It is well known that none of the German nations inhabit cities; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_96"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">96</FONT></A> or even admit of contiguous settlements. They dwell scattered and separate, as a spring, a meadow, or a grove may chance to invite them. Their villages are laid out, not like ours in rows of adjoining buildings; but every one surrounds his house with a vacant space, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_97"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">97</FONT></A> either by way of security against fire, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_97"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">97</FONT></A> or through ignorance of the art of building. For, indeed, they are unacquainted with the use of mortar and tiles; and for every purpose employ rude unshapen timber, fashioned with no regard to pleasing the eye. They bestow more than ordinary pains in coating certain parts of their buildings with a kind of earth, so pure and shining that it gives the appearance of painting. They also dig subterraneous caves, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_99"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">99</FONT></A> and cover them over with a great quantity of dung. These they use as winter-retreats, and granaries; for they preserve a moderate temperature; and upon an invasion, when the open country is plundered, these recesses remain unviolated, either because the enemy is ignorant of them, or because he will not trouble himself with the search. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_100"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">100</FONT></A></p>
