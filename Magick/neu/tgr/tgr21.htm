<p>21. It is an indispensable duty to adopt the enmities &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_125"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">125</FONT></A> of a father or relation, as well as their friendships: these, however, are not irreconcilable or perpetual. Even homicide is atoned &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_126"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">126</FONT></A> by a certain fine in cattle and sheep; and the whole family accepts the satisfaction, to the advantage of the public weal, since quarrels are most dangerous in a free state. No people are more addicted to social entertainments, or more liberal in the exercise of hospitality. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_127"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">127</FONT></A> To refuse any person whatever admittance under their roof, is accounted flagitious. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_128"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">128</FONT></A> Every one according to his ability feasts his guest: when his provisions are exhausted, he who was late the host, is now the guide and companion to another hospitable board. They enter the next house uninvited, and are received with equal cordiality. No one makes a distinction with respect to the rights of hospitality, between a stranger and an acquaintance. The departing guest is presented with whatever he may ask for; and with the same freedom a boon is desired in return. They are pleased with presents; but think no obligation incurred either when they give or receive.</p>
