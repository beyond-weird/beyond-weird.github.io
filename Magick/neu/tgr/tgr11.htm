<p>11. On affairs of smaller moment, the chiefs consult; on those of greater importance, the whole community; yet with this circumstance, that what is referred to the decision of the people, is first maturely discussed by the chiefs. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_71"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">71</FONT></A> They assemble, unless upon some sudden emergency, on stated days, either at the new or full moon, which they account the most auspicious season for beginning any enterprise. Nor do they, in their computation of time, reckon, like us, by the number of days, but of nights. In this way they arrange their business; in this way they fix their appointments; so that, with them, the night seems to lead the day. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_72"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">72</FONT></A> An inconvenience produced by their liberty is, that they do not all assemble at a stated time, as if it were in obedience to a command; but two or three days are lost in the delays of convening. When they all think fit, &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_73"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">73</FONT></A> they sit down armed. &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_74"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">74</FONT></A> Silence is proclaimed by the priests, who have on this occasion a coercive power. Then the king, or chief, and such others as are conspicuous for age, birth, military renown, or eloquence, are heard; and gain attention rather from their ability to persuade, than their authority to command. If a proposal displease, the assembly reject it by an inarticulate murmur; if it prove agreeable, they clash their javelins; &nbsp;<A HREF="tgr47.htm#xref_75"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="1">75</FONT></A> for the most honorable expression of assent among them is the sound of arms.</p>
