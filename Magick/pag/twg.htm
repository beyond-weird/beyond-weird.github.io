<H1>The White Goddess by Robert Graves</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>The White Goddess is a key book for modern Pagans
and Wiccans. Subtitled 'A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth',
Robert Graves investigates the links between poetry,
mythology and the worship of the Goddess.
The White Goddess had a profound influence on Gerald Gardner,
the modern reinventor of Paganism.</P>

<P>The White Goddess was one of the first widely available books
which uncompromisingly advocated a Goddess-centered spirituality.
It builds on Frazier's <A HREF="frazer/index.htm">Golden Bough</A>, but
written from the point of view of a working poet
struggling to reconcile the ancient crafts of poetry and
mythology with the brutality of the twentieth century.
Although it is a 'difficult book' it will also prove
very rewarding.
It does not provide details of ancient rituals or
try to reinvent them for a modern context;
rather it gives details on the profound
links between ancient runic alphabets, 
mysterious (and previously unexplained) Drudic and Bardic
poetry and the Celtic lunar year.
It bears the same relation to more practical books about
Wicca as a theoretical physics textbook does to
a users' manual for a computer.
Reading the White Goddess will
enhance your understanding of Wicca by giving you
deep background on the craft.
