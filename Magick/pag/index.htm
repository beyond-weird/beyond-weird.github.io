      <P>Neopaganism covers a wide range of belief systems which have emerged in 
      the past 50 years, primarily in the UK, Europe, and the United States. This 
      includes the better known Wicca, which is a synthesis of traditions from 
      the British Isles, as well as many less visible groups which draw inspiration 
      from other parts of the world. Based on folk-lore, traditional spiritual 
      practices, anthropology, and a synthesis of esoteric systems, Neopaganism 
      does not have any sacred texts of the same vintage as other religions, although 
      unverifiable claims have been made in a couple of cases (e.g. <A HREF="aradia/index.htm">Aradia</A>, 
      and <A HREF="gbos/index.htm">The Gardnerian Book of Shadows</A>).</P>
    <P> Rather, the books presented here are source texts of Neopaganism, and 
      other books which deal with related topics. Many of these books contain 
      outdated or speculative material, and some of the texts here are the product 
      of the Renaissance witch hunters. As a whole, the books here are of historical 
      importance rather than a roadmap to modern pagan practice, and shouldn't 
      be construed as such. As always, we encourage readers to think critically.</P>
    <P>Descriptions of contemporary Neopagan practice and beliefs can be found 
      in the <A HREF="../bos/index.htm">Internet Book of Shadows</A> section of 
      this site.</P>

      spells, and other knowledge. This tradition was carried on by Gerald Gardner, 
      who (depending on the account) either synthesized Wicca, or took it public, 
      during the 1950s. </span> </P>

    <P>Although little is actually known about the Druids, that didn't stop 18th 
      and 19th century intellectuals from building a romantic mythology around 
      them. This was closely associated with the rebirth of <A HREF="../neu/index.htm#celtic">Celtic 
      nationalism</A>, as well as the Romantic and <A HREF="../goth/index.htm">Gothic</A> 
      movements. This body of fact and speculation later became a central source

      This book is fairly typical of the mid-19th Century literature about Druidry, 
      which had some romantic misconceptions about the Druids. For instance, we 
      now know that the builders of Stonehenge preceded the historical Celts by

    <P> <span class="p-small2"> From the 14th to the 17th Century a hysteria spread 
      across Europe which involved torturing and executing people based on accusations 
      that they were witches. Whether any actual practicioners of a pre-Christian 
      pagan tradition were persecuted as the result of a witch trial is up for 
      debate. These books and texts are period documents which illustrate the 
      methods, rationale (such as it was) and history of this persecution. They 
      shouldn't be taken as illustrative of Neopaganism, but as a warning about 
      religious tolerance and the fragile nature of justice. </span> </P>
