<H1>Books of Gerald Gardner</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
Gerald Gardner was the central figure in the
Wiccan renaissance of the 1950s and 1960s.
He wrote several key texts of modern Wicca, including
<A HREF="gbos/index.htm">the Gardnerian Book of Shadows</A>.</P>
<P>
The copyright status of his books make it questionable
as to whether they can be posted on the Internet.
We encourage you to buy these books through the following links:

High Magic's Aid</A>. (1949)
This is a novel which is set in Medieval England, based very
closely on Margaret Murray's works
and the magical system described in
<A HREF="kos/index.htm">The Key of Solomon</A>.
Gardner sold copies of this book at his
Witchcraft Museum on the Isle of Man.
The fictional setting was necessitated by the harsh laws 
against witchcraft which were still on the books as of 1949,
and (reputedly) secrecy requirements placed on him
by the traditionalist coven which he had joined.
Although High Magic's Aid may not
quite succeed as a historical novel,
it is quite readble and is a significant document
in the evolution of modern Wicca.<P>

<LI>

Witchcraft Today</A> (1951) and the 

Meaning of Witchcraft</A> (1959)
(Note: these books are currently out of print, but should be obtainable
on the used book market).
These books are non-fictional, popularized recitations of Gardners'
evolving views on Wicca.
After the repeal of the witchcraft laws in England in 1951,
Gardner finally convinced his traditionalist coven to allow him
to publish some of the details of their previously 
secret beliefs and practices.
Or so the story goes; in any case, these are transitional
books in which Gardner is weaving together the various strands
of modern Wicca.
These books created a sensation and Gardner became what amounted to
the first Wiccan media star.
