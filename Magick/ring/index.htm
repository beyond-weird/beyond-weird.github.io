    <P> <span class="p-small2"> J.R.R. Tolkiens' Middle Earth did not come out 
      of thin air. Tolkien, an academic linguist, drew on the following source 
      materials to inspire his world-building exercise. The texts presented at 
      this site are complete and in some cases in the original languages. </span>

      <A HREF="../neu/kvfin/index.htm">The Kalevala. [Finnish]</A><BR>
      <span class="p-small2"> This Finnish saga, replete with battling wizards 
      and heroes, quests and magical objects has been cited as one of the early 
      inspirations for Tolkien. The languages of Middle Earth also have more than 
      a passing resemblance to Finnish. </span> </P>

      <A HREF="../neu/pre/index.htm">The Younger (Prose) Edda.</A><BR>
      <span class="p-small2"> These Icelandic collections of epic poetry are key 
      sources for the study of Norse mythology. Our plane of existence is called 
      'Middle Earth' in this mythology. Tolkien also took many of the names of 
      key characters from this text; particularly one sequence early on in the 
      <A HREF="../neu/poe/poe03.htm">Voluspo</A>, including Gandalf, and all of 
      the Dwarves from <CITE>the Hobbit</CITE>. Also found in the Eddas is the 
      forest of Myrkwood; Bilbo's party traversed the vast Mirkwood forest in 
      the Hobbit. </span>

      <A HREF="../neu/nblng/index.htm">The Nibelungenlied</A><BR>
      <span class="p-small2"> The Volsung saga is the Icelandic version of the 
      story which was later re-told in the Germanic Nibelungenlied. This was the 
      basis for Wagner's Ring cycle. The cursed ring of doom is likewise a central 
      theme of Tolkiens' mythology. </span> </P>

      <span class="p-small2"> by Snorri Sturlson. tr. Samuel Laing [1844]<BR>
      Gandalf is not only mentioned in the Voluspo, but in the Heimskringla Sagas: 
      Gandalf was the name of the last king to rule over Alfheim, He was killed 
      by Harald Harfagra in the year 866. Gandalf gets mentioned in <A HREF="../neu/heim/02ynglga.htm">The 
      Ynglinga Saga</A>, <A HREF="../neu/heim/03halfdn.htm">Halfdan, the Black 
      Saga</A>, and <A HREF="../neu/heim/04harfgr.htm">Harald Harfager's Saga</A>.

      <A HREF="../neu/asbeo.htm">Beowulf [Anglo Saxon]</A><BR>
      <span class="p-small2"> Tolkien was a distinguished scholar of Middle and 
      Old English. The Beowulf saga is one of the treasures of this branch of 
      literature, and Grendel, the monster of this tale, is a prototype for many 
      of the darker creatures that populate Middle Earth. </span> </P>

      Among the sources for Tokien's languages was Welsh, and the Welsh stories 
      of the 'Red Book of Hergest' appear to have also had an influence on the 
      narratives of Tolkien's fictional 'Red Book of Westmarch'. </span> </P>

      by Mary Macleod [1916]<BR>
      </span> <span class="p-small2"> The <I>Faerie Queene</I> is one of the wellsprings 
      of modern Fantasy writing. Spenser, like Tolkien, did not simply retell 
      classical or medieval stories. He used similar themes and elements but put 
      the pieces together in an entirely new way, constructing an invented reality 
      with a consistent internal logic. </span> </P>

      <span class="p-small2"> by William Morris [1895]<BR>
      One of the recognized forerunners of Tolkien was William Morris, skilled 
      artist, pioneering Socialist, translator of Icelandic sagas, and fantasy 
      writer. <I>The Wood Beyond the World</I> is one of Morris' masterpieces 
      which he originally published using hand-set type. </span> </P>
