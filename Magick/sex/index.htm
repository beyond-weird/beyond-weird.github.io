    <span class="p-small2"> 
      <P> The dominant world religions treat sexuality as (at best) a distraction 
        from the spiritual path. On the other hand, some spiritual traditions 
        integrate sexuality into their spiritual practice. Some regard sexuality 
        as an integral part of life, a gift to be honored and enjoyed. This section 
        contains classic texts which discuss the sacred nature of sexuality and 
        affirm the postive aspects of sex. Some of these texts (the Tantric) are 
        esoteric and touch on the intersection of the spiritual and the physical. 
        Others (such as the Kama Sutra material) are more rooted in the physical 
        world.</P>  </span>

      <P> <span class="p-small2"> In addition to Tantra, which attributes a spritual 
        dimension to sexuality, India has produced a rich literature of sophisticated 
        sex manuals. In spite of their <I>practical</I> nature, they demonstrate 
        how Indian culture integrated sexuality into everyday life, (including 
        religion and spirituality). This knowledge was supposed to be part of 
        the repetoire of any intelligent and well-educated adult. Several of these 
        were translated in the Victorian Era by freethinking Orientalists. </span>

      <H4>About these translations</H4>
      <span class="p-small2"> 
      <P> These translations (as well as the Perfumed Garden and the Priapeia) 
        were produced by Sir Richard Burton and Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot and 
        published by the Kama Shastra Society (founded 1882).</P>
      <P> Sir Richard Burton [1821-1890] (not to be confused with the screen actor) 
        was an orientalist and daring explorer. Fluent in Arabic and Islamic culture, 
        Burton was the first Westerner to enter Mecca (in disguise). He is also 
        known for his unexpurgated translation of the <A HREF="../neu/burt1k1/index.htm">Arabian 
        Nights</A>.</P>
      <P> F.F. Arbuthnot did most of the actual work of the translations of the 
        Indian works, while working for the Indian Civil Service in Bombay from 
        1868 to 1879. He was able to consult original texts of the Kama Sutra 
        and Ananga Ranga and discuss their contents with Indian scholars. 
      <P> The texts were printed 'for private circulation only' -- a disclaimer 
        required in the stifling atmosphere of Victorian England.</P>

      <P> In the late 18th century, classical scholars began to take note of a 
        phenomena which they termed 'Priapus worship'. This was a complex of religious 
        ideas in antiquity including phallic votive objects, fertility ceremonies, 
        sacred prostitution, female and hermaphroditic creator deities, and other 
        heterodox aspects of ancient religion. Much of this information had been 
        surpressed or ignored. </P>

      (Latin and English) Translated by L.C. Smithers, notes by Sir Richard Burton 
      [1890] This is an anonymous collection of bawdy epigrams to the phallic

      which discusses in explicit detail the sexual practices of the classical

      genitalia and short essays about classical references to anal and oral sex, 
      bestiality, exotic dancers, masturbation, sex positions, and the lascivious 
      behavior of the Gods and Goddesses. These appendices were so shocking that 
      Burton disavowed any connection with the book, in spite of obvious internal
