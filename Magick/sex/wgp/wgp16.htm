<P>The worship of the reproductive organs as representing the fertilizing, protecting, and saving powers of nature, apart from these secret rites, prevailed universally, as we have traced it fully in the preceding pages, and we only recur to that part of the subject to state that perhaps the last traces of it now to be found in our islands is met with on the western shores of Ireland. Off the coast of Mayo, there is a small island named Inniskea, the inhabitants of which are a very primitive and uncultivated race, and which, although it takes its name from a female saint (it is the <I>insular sanct&aelig; Geidhe</I> of the Hibernian hagiographers), does not contain a single Catholic priest.

I am informed that the Name <I>Neevougee</I> is merely the plural of a word signifying a canoe, and it may perhaps have some reference to the calling of fishermen.</P>
