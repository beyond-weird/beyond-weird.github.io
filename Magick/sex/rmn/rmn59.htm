<P ALIGN="CENTER">PLATE LVIII.</P>
<P>THIS vase is of the kind which the Neapolitans call <I>campana</I>, on account of their shape, which has some resemblance to a bell.</P>
<P>On one side is represented a scene of the Dionysia or Bacchanalia. Three men are taking part in them, each furnished with preposterous phalluses. One of these personages is seated, and represents old Silenus: this is the hierophant, the president of the festival. To the spectator's right is a Bacchus covered with the chlamys, and with his head in a hairy casque. Between these two divinities may be seen a little old man, who draws near the hierophant, places one hand on his thigh, and prepares to worship the attributes of the god.</P>
<P>The other side represents a Bacchic game. A young woman is stooping to pick up the sph&aelig;ra (a kind of ball) which she has dropped, but her awkwardness is equivalent to a defeat, and her adversary approaches her to exercise the rights of victory.</P>
<P>These two subjects are intermingled with foliage and with arabesques.</P>
