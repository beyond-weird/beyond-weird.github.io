<P>FIGURE No. 1 represents the bust of a bearded Pan placed on a Hermes. In the centre of the latter is the Priapian sign. The head and the phallus are in bronze.</P>
<P>No. 2 is a grotesque figure, representing the same god.</P>

All these, ideas were mixed together in one common belief, and gave rise to the same identical forms of worship.</P>
