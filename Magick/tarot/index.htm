      Voley has graciously scanned a set of vintage Tarot cards for BeyondWeird, 
      the earliest in her collection. These images can be viewed when you click 
      on any of the black and white thumbnails in the Pictorial Key to the Tarot, 
      or in the right-hand frame in the Tarot card reader. They can also be viewed 
      sequentially in the <A HREF="xr/index.htm">Tarot Card Cross-reference</A>. 
      These Tarot card images are unambiguously in the public domain in the United 
      States, and differ only slightly from the US Games Tarot deck. This deck 
      is the one known as the 'Pamela-A' deck with the <A HREF="pkt/img/verso.jpg">dried 
      mud</A> pattern on the back of the cards. There are also high resolution 
      images of three of the Pamela-A cards available below in the <A HREF="tcc/index.htm">Tarot
