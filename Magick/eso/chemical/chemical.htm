</B> 
<P>On an evening before Easter-day, I sat at a table, and having (as my custom 
  was) in my humble prayer sufficiently conversed with my Creator, and considered 
  many great mysteries (whereof the Father of Lights his Majesty had shewn me 
  not a few) and being now ready to prepare in my heart, together with my dear 
  Paschal Lamb, a small, unleavened, undefiled cake; All on a sudden ariseth so 
  horrible a tempest, that I imagined no other but that through its mighty force, 
  the hill whereon my little house was founded, would flye in pieces. But in as 
  much as this, and the like from the Devil (who had done me many a spight) was 
  no new thing to me, I took courage, and persisted in my meditation, till some 
  body after an unusual manner, touched me on the back; whereupon I was so hugely 
  terrified, that I durst hardly look about me; yet I shewed myself as cheerful 
  as (in the like occurrence.) humane frailty would permit; now the same thing 
  still twitching me several times. by the coat, I looked back, and behold it 
  was a fair and glorious lady, whose garments were all skye-colour, and curiously 
  (like Heaven) bespangled with golden stars, in her right hand she bare a trumpet 
  of beaten gold, whereon a Name was ingraven which I could well read in but am 
  as yet forbidden to reveal it. In her left hand she had a great bundle of letters 
  of all languages, which she (as I afterwards understood) was to carry into all 
  countries. She had also large and beautiful wings, full of eyes throughout, 
  wherewith she could mount aloft, and flye swifter than any eagle. I might perhaps 
  been able to take further notice of her, but because she stayed so small time 
  with me, and terror and amazement still possessed me, I was fain to be content. 
  For as soon as I turned about, she turned her letters over and over, and at 
  length drew out a small one, with which great reverence she laid down upon the 
  table, and without giving one word, departed from me. But in her mounting upward, 
  she gave so mighty a blast on her gallant trumpet, that the whole hill echoed 
  thereof, and for a full quarter of an hour after, I could hardly hear my own 
  words.</P>
<P>In so unlooked for an adventure I was at a loss, how either to advise, or assist 
  my poor self, and therefore fell upon my knees and besought my Creator to permit 
  nothing contrary to my eternal happiness to befall me; whereupon with fear and 
  trembling, I went to the letter, which was now so heavy, as had it been mere 
  gold, it could hardly have been so weighty. Now as I we. diligently viewing 
  it, I found a little seal, whereupon a curious cross with this inscription, 
  IN HOC SIGNO VINCES,(1) was ingraven. Now as soon as I espied this sign I was 
  the more comforted, as not being ignorant that such a seal was little acceptable, 
  and much less useful, to the Devil. Whereupon I tenderly opened the letter, 
  and within it, in an azure field, in golden letters, found the following verses 
  written. </P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="merc.gif"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;This day, this day, this, this</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Royal Wedding is.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Art thou thereto by birth inclin'd,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And unto joy of God design'd,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Then may'st thou to the mountain trend,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Whereon three stately temples stand,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And there see all from end to end.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Keep watch, and ward,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Thy self regard;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Unless with diligence thou bathe,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Wedding can't thee harmless save;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He'l damage have that here delays;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Let him beware, too light that weighs.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Underneath stood Sponsus and Sponsa. (2)</P>
<P>As soon as I had read this letter, I was presently like to have fainted away, 
  all my hair stood on end, and a cold sweat trickled down my whole body. For 
  although I well perceived that this was the appointed wedding, whereof seven 
  years before I was acquainted in a bodily vision, and which now so long time 
  I had with great earnestness attended, (3) and which lastly, by the account 
  and calculation of the planets, I had most diligently observed, I found so to 
  be, yet could I never fore-see that it must happen under so grievous perilous 
  conditions. For whereas I before imagined that to be a well-come and acceptable 
  guest, I needed only be ready to appear at the wedding, I was now directed to 
  Divine Providence, of which until this time I was never certain. I also found 
  by my self, the more I examined my self, that in my head there was nothing but 
  gross mis-understanding, and blindness in mysterious things, so that I was not 
  able to comprehend even those things which lay under my feet, and which I daily 
  conversed with, much less that I should be born to the searching out, and understanding 
  of the secrets of Nature, since in my opinion Nature might every where find 
  a more virtuous disciple, to whom to intrust her precious, though temporary, 
  and changeable treasures. I found also that my bodily behaviour, and outward 
  good conversation, and brotherly love toward my neighbour, was not duly purged 
  and cleansed; moreover the tickling of the flesh manifested itself, whose affection 
  was bent only to pomp and bravery, and worldly pride, and not to the good of 
  mankind: and I was always contriving how by this art I might in a short time 
  abundantly increase my profit and advantage, rear up stately palaces, make my 
  self an everlasting name in the world, and other like carnal designs. But the 
  obscure words concerning the three temples did particularly afflict me, which 
  I was not able to make out by any after-speculation, and perhaps should not 
  yet, had they not been wonderfully revealed to me. Thus sticking betwixt hope 
  and fear, examining my self again and again, and finding only my own frailty 
  and impotency, not being in any wise able to succour myself, and exceedingly 
  amazed at the fore-mentioned threatening, at length I betook myself to my usual 
  and most secure course; after I had finished my earnest and most fervent prayer, 
  I laid me down in my bed, that so perchance my good angel by the Divine permission 
  might appear, and (as it had sometimes formerly happened) instruct me in this 
  doubtful affair, which to the praise of God, my own good, and my neighbours 
  faithful and hearty warning and amendment did now likewise fall out. For I was 
  yet scarce fallen asleep, when me-thought, I, together with a numberless multitude 
  of men lay fettered with great chains in a dark dungeon, wherein without the 
  least glimpse of light, we swarmed like bees one over another, and thus rendered 
  each others affliction more grievous. But although neither I, nor any of the 
  rest could see one jot, yet I continually heard one heaving himself above the 
  other, when his chains or fetters were become ever so little lighter, though 
  none of us had much reason to shove up the other, since we were all captive 
  wretches. Now as I with the rest had continued a good while in this affliction, 
  and each was still reproaching the other with his blindness and captivity, at 
  length we heard many trumpets sounding together, and kettle drums beating so 
  artificially thereto, that it even revived and rejoiced us in our calamity. 
  During this noise the cover of the dungeon was from above lifted up, and a little 
  light let down unto us. Then first might truly have been discerned the bustle 
  we kept, for all went pesle-mesle, and he who perchance had too much heaved 
  up himself, was forced down again under the others feet. In brief, each one 
  strove to be uppermost, neither did I my self linger, but with my weighty fetters 
  slipt up from under the rest, and then heaved myself upon a stone, which I laid 
  hold of; howbeit, I was several times caught at by others, from whom yet as 
  well as I might, with hands and feet I still guarded my self. For we imagined 
  no other but that we should all be set at liberty, which yet fell out quite 
  otherwise. For after the nobles who looked upon us from above through the hole, 
  had a while recreated themselves with this our struggling and lamenting, a certain 
  hoary-headed ancient man called us to be quiet, and having scarce obtained it, 
  began (as I still remember) thus to say on.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;If wretched mankind would forbear</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Themselves so to uphold,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Then sure on them much good confer,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">My righteous Mother would:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">But since the same will not ensue,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">They must in care and sorrow rue,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And still in prison lie.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Howbeit, my dear Mother will</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Their follies over-see,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Her choicest goods permitting still</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Too much in the' light to be.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Though very rarely it may seem</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That they may still keep some esteem,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Which else would pass for forgery.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Wherefore in honour of the feast</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We this day solemnise,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That so her grace may be increast,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A good deed she'1 devise.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">For now a cord shall be let down,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And whosoe'er can hang thereon,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Shall freely be releast.</P>
<P>He had scarce done speaking when an ancient matron commanded her servants to 
  let down the cord seven times into the dungeon, and draw up whosoever could 
  hang upon it. Good God! that I could sufficiently describe the hurry and disquiet 
  that then arose amongst us for every one strove to get to the cord, and yet 
  only hindered each other. But after seven minutes a sign was given by a little 
  bell, whereupon at the first pull the servants drew up four. At that time I 
  could not come near the cord by much, having (as is before-mentioned) to my 
  huge misfortune, betaken my self to a stone at the wall of the dungeon, and 
  thereby was disabled to get to the cord which descended in the middle. The cord 
  was let down the second time, but divers, because their chains were too heavy, 
  and their hands too tender, could not keep their hold on the cord, but with 
  themselves beat down many another, who else perhaps might have held fast enough; 
  nay, many an one was forcibly pulled off by another, who yet could not himself 
  get at it, so mutually envious were we even in this our great misery. But they 
  of all others most moved my compassion, whose weight was so heavy, that they 
  tore their very hands from their bodies, and yet could not get up. Thus it came 
  to pass that at those five times very few were drawn up. For as soon as the 
  sign was given, the servants were so nimble at the draught, that the most part 
  tumbled one upon another, and the cord, this time especially, was drawn up very 
  empty. Whereupon the greatest part, and even I myself, despaired of redemption, 
  and called upon God that he would have pity on us, and (if possible) deliver 
  us out of this obscurity, who also then heard some of us: for when the cord 
  came down the sixth time, some of them hung themselves fast upon it; and whilst 
  in the drawing up, the cord swung from one side to the other, it (perhaps by 
  the will of God) came to me, which I suddenly catching, uppermost above all 
  the rest, and so at length beyond hope came out; whereat I exceedingly rejoiced, 
  so that I perceived not the wound, which in the drawing up I received on my 
  head by a sharp stone, till I with the rest who were released (as was always 
  before done) was fain to help at the seventh and last pull, at which time through 
  straining, the blood ran down all over my clothes, which I</P>
<P>nevertheless for joy regarded not. Now when the last draught whereon the most 
  of all hung, was finished, the matron caused the cord to be laid away, and willed 
  her aged son to declare her resolution to the rest of the prisoners, who after 
  he had a little bethought himself spoke, thus unto them.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;Ye children dear</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">All present here,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">What is but now complete and done,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Was long before resolved on:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">What er'r my mother of great grace</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">To each on both sides here hath shown,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">May never discontent mix-place;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The joyful time is drawing on,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">When every one shall equal be,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">None wealthy, none in penury.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who er'e receiveth great commands</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Hath work enough to fill his hands.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who er'e with much hath trusted been,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">'Tis well if he may save his skin.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Wherefore your lamentations cease,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">What is't to wait for some few days?&quot;</P>
<P>As soon as he had finished these words, the cover was again put to and locked 
  down, and the trumpets and kettle-drums began afresh, yet could not the noise 
  thereof be so loud, but that the bitter lamentation of the prisoners which arose 
  in the dungeon was heard above all, which soon also caused my eyes to run-over. 
  Presently after the ancient matron, together with her son sat down on seats 
  before prepared, and commanded the redeemed should be told. Now as soon as she 
  understood the number, and had written it down in a gold-yellow tablet, she 
  demanded every ones name, which were also written down by a little page; having 
  viewed us all, one after another, she sighed, and spoke to her son, so as I 
  could well hear her, &quot;Ah how hartily am I grieved for the poor men in the 
  dungeon! I would to God I durst release them all,&quot; whereunto her son replied; 
  &quot;It is mother thus ordained of God, against whom we may not contend. In 
  case we all of us were lords, and possessed all the goods upon Earth, and were 
  seated at table, who would there then be to bring up the service?&quot; whereupon 
  his mother held her peace, but soon after she said; &quot;Well, however, let 
  these be freed from their fetters&quot;, which was likewise presently done, 
  and I, except a few was the last; yet I could not refrain, but (though I still 
  looked upon the rest) bowed myself before the ancient matron, and thanked God 
  that through her, had graciously and fatherly vouch-safed to bring me out of 
  such darkness into the light: after me the rest did likewise, to the satisfaction 
  of the matron. Lastly, to every one was given a piece of gold for a remembrance, 
  and to spend by the Way, on the one whereof was stamped the rising sun, on the 
  other (as I remember) these three letters, D.L.S.,(4) and therewith every one 
  had license to depart, and was sent to his own business with this annexed intimation, 
  that we to the glory of God should benefit our neighbours, and reserve in silence 
  what we had been intrusted with, which we also promised to do, and so departed 
  one from another. But in regard of the wounds which the fetters had caused me, 
  I could not well go forward, but halted on both feet, which the matron presently 
  espying, laughing at it and calling me again to her said thus to me, &quot;My 
  son, let not this defect afflict thee, but call to mind thy infirmities, and 
  therewith thank God who hath permitted thee even in this world, and in the state 
  of thy imperfection to come into so high a light, and keep these wounds for 
  my sake.&quot; Whereupon the trumpets began again to sound, which so affrighted 
  me that I awoke, and then first perceived that it was only a dream, which was 
  so strongly impressed upon my imagination, that I was still perpetually troubled 
  about it, and me thought I was yet sensible of the wounds on my feet. Howbeit, 
  by all these things I well understood that God had vouchsafed that I should 
  be present at this mysterious and bidden wedding; wherefore with childlike confidence 
  I returned thanks to his Divine Majesty, and besought him, that he would further 
  preserve me in his fear, that he would daily fill my heart with wisdom and understanding, 
  and at length graciously (without my desert) conduct me to the desired end. 
  Hereupon I prepared my self for the way, put on my white linen coat, girded 
  my loins, with a blood-red ribbon bound-cross-ways over my shoulder. In my hat 
  I stuck four red roses, that I might the sooner by this token be taken notice 
  of Amongst the throng. For food I took bread, salt and water, which by the counsel 
  of an understanding person I had at certain times used, not without profit, 
  in the like occurrences. But before I parted from my cottage, I first in this 
  my dress and wedding garment, fell down upon my knees, and besought God, that 
  in case such a thing were, he would vouchsafe me a good issue. And thereupon 
  in the presence of God I made a Vow, that if any thing through his grace should 
  be revealed unto me, I would employ it neither to my own honour nor authority 
  in the world, but to the spreading of his Name, and the service of my neighbour. 
  And with this vow, and good hope I departed out of my cell with joy.</P>
<B> 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Second Day</FONT></P>
</B> 
<P>I was hardly got out of my cell into a forest when me thought the whole heaven 
  and all the elements had already trimmed themselves against (5) this wedding. 
  For even the birds chanted more pleasantly then before, and the young fawns 
  skipped so merrily, that they rejoiced my old heart, and moved me to sing: wherefore 
  with a loud voice I thus began:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;With mirth thou pretty bird rejoice,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Thy Maker's praise in-tranced.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Lift up thy shrill and pleasant voice,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Thy God is high advanced.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Thy food before he did provide,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And gives it in a fitting side,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Therewith be thou sufficed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Why should'st thou now unpleasant be,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Thy wrath against God venting?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That he a little bird made thee,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Thy silly head tormenting?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Because he made thee not a man,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">O peace, he hath well thought thereon.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Therewith be thou sufficed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">What is't I'd have poor earthly worm,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">By God (as'twere) inditing,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That I should thus 'gainst Heaven storm</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">To force great arts by fighting?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">God will out-braved be by none,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who's good for naught, may hence be gone,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">O man b' herewith sufficed.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That he no Caesar hath thee fram'd,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">To pine therefore 'tis needless</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">His name perhaps thou hadst defam'd</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Whereof he was not heedless</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Most clear and bright Gods eyes do shine,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He pierces to thy heart within,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And cannot be deceived.&quot;</P>
<P>This sang I now from the bottom of my heart throughout the whole forest, so 
  that it resounded from all parts, and the hills repeated my last words, until 
  at length I espied a curious green heath, wither I betook my self out of the 
  forest. Upon this heath stood three lovely tall cedars, which by reason of their 
  breadth afforded an excellent and desired shade, whereat I greatly rejoiced; 
  for although I had not hitherto gone far, yet my earnest longing made me very 
  faint, whereupon I hasted to the trees to rest a little under them, but as soon 
  as I came somewhat higher, I espied a tablet fastened to one of them, on which 
  (as afterwards I read) in curious letters the following words were written:</P>
<P>&quot;God save thee, stranger! If thou hast heard anything concerning the nuptials 
  of the King, consider these words. By us doth the Bridegroom offer thee a choice 
  between four ways, all of which, if thou dost not sink down in the way, can 
  bring thee to his royal court. The first is short but dangerous, and one which 
  will lead thee into rocky places, through which it will be scarcely possible 
  to pass. The second is longer, and takes thee circuitously; it is plain and 
  easy, if by the help of the Magnet, thou turnest neither to left nor right. 
  The third is that truly royal way which through various pleasures and pageants 
  of our King, affords thee a joyful journey; but this so far has scarcely been 
  allotted to one in a thousand. By the fourth shall no man reach the place, because 
  it is a consuming way, practicable only for incorruptible bodies. Choose now 
  which thou wilt of the three, and persevere constantly therein, for know which 
  soever thou shalt enter, that is the one destined for thee by immutable Fate, 
  nor canst thou go back therein save at great peril to life. These are the things 
  which we would have thee know, but, ho, beware! thou knowest not with how much 
  danger thou cost commit thyself to this way, for if thou knowest thyself by 
  the smallest fault to be obnoxious to the laws of our King, I beseech thee, 
  while it is still possible, to return swiftly to thy house by the way thou camest.&quot;</P>
<P>As soon as I had read this writing all my joy was near vanished again, and 
  I who before sang merrily, began now inwardly to lament. For although I saw 
  all the three ways before me, and understood that hence forward it was vouchsafed 
  me, to make choice of one of them, yet it troubled me that in case I went the 
  stony and rocky way, I might get a miserable and deadly fall, or taking the 
  long one, I might wander out of it through by-ways, or be otherway's detained 
  in the great journey. Neither durst I hope, that I amongst thousands should 
  be the very one who should choose the royal way. I saw likewise the fourth before 
  me, but it was so invironed with fire and exhalations, that I durst not (by 
  much) draw near it, and therefore again and again considered, whether I should 
  turn back, or take any of the ways before me. I well weighted my own unworthiness, 
  but the dream still comforted me, that I was delivered out of the tower, and 
  yet I durst not confidently rely upon a dream; whereupon I was so variously 
  perplexed, that for very great weariness, hunger and thirst seized me, whereupon 
  I presently drew out my bread, cut a slice of it, which a snow-white dove of 
  whom I was not aware, sitting upon the tree, espied and therewith (perhaps according 
  to her wonted manner) came down, and betook herself very familiarly with me, 
  to whom I willingly imparted my food, which she received, and so with her prettiness 
  did again a little refresh me. But as soon as her enemy a most black raven perceived 
  it, he straight darted himself down upon the dove, and taking no notice of me, 
  would needs force away the dove's meat, who could no otherwise guard her self 
  but by flight; whereupon they both together flew towards the south, at which 
  I was so hugely incensed and grieved, that without thinking what I did, I made 
  hast after the filthy raven, and so against my will ran into one of the forementioned 
  ways a whole fields length; and thus the raven being chased away, and the dove 
  delivered, I then first observed what I had inconsiderately done, and that I 
  was already entered into a way, from which under peril of great punishment I 
  durst not retire. And though I had still herewith in some measure to comfort 
  my self, yet that which was worst of all to me, was, that I had left my bag 
  and bread at the tree, and could never retrieve them. For as soon as I turned 
  my self about, a contrary wind was so strong against me, that it was ready to 
  fell me. But if I went forward on my way, I perceived no hinderance at all. 
  From whence I could easily conclude, that it would cost me my life, in case 
  I should set my self against the wind, wherefore I patiently took up my cross, 
  got up on my feet, and resolved, since so it must be, I would use my utmost 
  endeavour to get to my journeys end before night. Now although many apparent 
  byways shewed themselves, yet I still proceeded with my compass, and would not 
  budge one step from the Meridian Line; howbeit the way was oftentimes so rugged 
  and unpassable, that I was in no little doubt of it. On this way I constantly 
  thought upon the dove and raven, and yet could not search out the meaning until 
  at length upon a high hill afar off I espied a stately portal, to which not 
  regarding how far it was distant both from me and the way I was in, I hasted, 
  because the sun had already hid himself under the hills, and I could elsewhere 
  espy no abiding place, and this verily I ascribe only to God, who might well 
  have permitted me to go forward in this way, and withheld my eyes that so I 
  might have gazed beside this gate. To which I now made mighty haste, and reached 
  it by so much daylight, as to take a very competent view of it. Now it was an 
  exceeding royal beautiful portal, whereon were carved a multitude of most noble 
  figures and devices, every one of which (as I afterwards learned) had its peculiar 
  signification. Above was fixed a pretty large tablet, with these words, <I>Procul 
  hinc, procul ite profani</I>, (6) and other things more, that I was earnestly 
  forbidden to relate. Now as soon as I was come under the portal, there straight 
  stepped forth one in a sky-coloured habit, whom I in friendly manner saluted, 
  which though he thankfully returned, yet he instantly demanded of me my letter 
  of invitation. O how glad was I that I had then brought it with me. For how 
  easily might I have forgotten it (as it also chanced to others) as he himself 
  told me' I quickly presented it, wherewith he was not only satisfied, but (at 
  which I much wondered) shewed me abundance of respect, saying, Come in my brother, 
  an acceptable guest you are to me; and withal intreated me not to with-hold 
  my name from him. Now having replied, that I was a Brother of the Red-Rosie 
  Cross, he both wondered, and seemed to rejoice at it, and then proceeded thus, 
  My brother, have you nothing about you wherewith to purchase a token? I answered 
  my ability was small, but if he saw any thing about me he had a mind to, it 
  was at his service. Now he having requested of me my bottle of water, and I 
  granted it he gives me a golden token whereon stood no more but these two letters, 
  S. C., (7) intreating me that when it stood me in good stead, I would remember 
  him. After which I asked him, how many were got in before me, which he also 
  told me, and lastly out of mere friendship gave me a sealed letter to the second 
  Porter. Now having lingered some time with him, the night grew on. Whereupon 
  a great beacon upon the gates was immediately fired, that so if any were still 
  upon the way, he might make hasted hither. But the way where it finished at 
  the castle, was on both sides inclosed with walls, and planted with all sorts 
  of excellent fruit trees, and still on every third tree on each side lanterns 
  were hung up, wherein all the candles were already lighted with a glorious torch 
  by a beautiful Virgin, habited in skye-colour, which was so noble and majestic 
  a spectacle, that I yet delayed somewhat longer than was requisite. But at length 
  after sufficient information, and an advantageous instruction, I friendly departed 
  from the first Porter. On the way, though I would gladly have known what was 
  written in my letter, yet since I had no reason to mistrust the Porter, I forbare 
  my purpose, and so went on the way, until I came likewise to the second gate, 
  which though it was very like the other, yet was it adorned with images and 
  mystic significations. In the affixed tablet stood <I>Date et dabitur vobis.</I> 
  (8) Under this gate lay a terrible grim lion chain'd, who as soon as he espied 
  me arose and made at me with great roaring; whereupon the second Porter who 
  lay upon a stone of marble awaked, and wished me not to be troubled or affrighted, 
  and then drove back the lion, and having received the letter which I with trembling 
  reached him, he read it, and with very great respect spake thus to me, &quot;Now 
  well-come in Gods Name unto me the man whom of long time I would gladly have 
  seen.&quot; Meanwhile he also drew out a token, and asked me whether I could 
  purchase it? But having nothing else left but my salt, presented it to him, 
  which he thankfully accepted. Upon this token again stood only two letters, 
  namely, S. M.(9) Being now just about to enter discourse with him, it began 
  to ring in the castle, whereupon the Porter counselled me to run apace, or else 
  all the pains and labour I had hitherto taken would serve to no purpose, for 
  the lights above began already to be extinguished; whereupon I dispatched with 
  such haste that I heeded not the Porter, in such anguish was I, and truly it 
  was but necessary, for I could not run so fast but that the Virgin, after whom 
  all the lights were put out, was at my heels, and I should never have found 
  the way, had not she with her torch afforded me some light; I was moreover constrained 
  to enter the very next to her, and the gate was so suddenly clap's to, that 
  a part of my coat was locked out, which I was verily forced to leave behind 
  me; for neither I, nor they who stood ready without and called at the gate could 
  prevail with the Porter to open it again, but he delivered the keys to the Virgin, 
  who took them with her into the court. Mean time I again surveyed the gate, 
  which now appeared so rich, as the whole world could not equal it; just by the 
  door were two columns on one of which stood a pleasant figure with this inscription, 
  Congratulor. The other having its countenance veiled was sad, and beneath was 
  written, Condoleo. In brief, the inscriptions and figures thereon, were so dark 
  and mysterious, that the most dexterous man upon earth could not have expounded 
  them. But all these (if God permit) I shall ever long publish and explain. Under 
  this gate I was again to give my name, which was this last time written down 
  in a little vellum book, and immediately with the rest dispatched to the Lord 
  Bridegroom. Here it was where I first received the true guest token, which was 
  somewhat less than the former, but yet much heavier. </P>
<P>Upon this stood these letters, S. P. N. Besides this, a new pair of shoes were 
  given me, for the floor of the castle was laid with pure shining marble; my 
  old shoes I was to give away to one of the poor who sate in throngs, howbeit 
  in very good order, under the gate. I then bestowed them on an old man; after 
  which two pages with as many torches conducted me into a little room; there 
  they willed me to sit down on a form, which I did, but they sticking their torches 
  in two holes, made in the pavement, departed and thus left me sitting alone. 
  Soon after I heard a noise, but saw nothing, and it proved to be certain men 
  who stumbled in upon me; but since I could see nothing, I was fain to suffer, 
  and attend what they would do with me; but presently perceiving them to be barbers, 
  I intreated them not to jostle me so, for I was content to do whatever they 
  desired, whereupon they quickly let me go, and so one of them (whom I could 
  not yet see) fine and gently cut away the hair-round about from the crown of 
  my head, but on my forehead, ears and eyes he permitted my ice-grey locks to 
  hang. In his first encounter (I must confess) I was ready to dispair, for inasmuch 
  as some of them shoved me so forceably, and I could yet see nothing, I could 
  think no other but that God for my curiosity had suffered me to miscarry. Now 
  these invisible barbers carefully gathered up the hair which was cut off, and 
  carried it away with them. After which the two pages entered again, and heartily 
  laughed at me for being so terrified. But they had scarce spoken a few words 
  with me, when again a little bell began to ring, which (as the pages informed 
  me) was to give notice for assembling; whereupon they willed me to rise, and 
  through many walks, doors and winding stairs lighted me into a spacious hall. 
  In this room was a great multitude of guests, emperors, kings, princes, and 
  lords, noble and ignoble, rich and poor, and all sorts of people, at which I 
  hugely marvelled, and thought to my self, ah, how gross a fool hast thou been 
  to engage upon this journey with so much bitterness and toil, when (behold) 
  here are even those fellows whom thou well know'st, and yet hadst never any 
  reason to esteem. They are now all here, and thou with all thy prayers and supplications 
  art hardly got in at last. This and more the Devil at that time injected, whom 
  I notwithstanding (as well as I could) directed to the issue. Mean time one 
  or other of my acquaintance here and there spoke to me: Oh Brother Rosencreutz! 
  Art thou here too; yea, (my brethren) replied I, the grace of God hath helped 
  me in also; at which they raised a mighty laughter, looking upon it as ridiculous 
  that there should be need of God in so slight an occasion. Now having demanded 
  each of them concerning his way, and found that most were forced to clamber 
  over the rocks, certain trumpets (none of which we yet saw) began to sound to 
  the table, whereupon they all seated themselves, every one as he judged himself 
  above the rest; so that for me and some other sorry fellows there was hardly 
  a little nook left at the lower-most table. Presently the two pages entered, 
  and one of them said grace in so handsom and excellent manner, as rejoyced the 
  very heart in my body.</P>
<P>Howbeit, certain great St John's made but little reckoning of them, but fleired 
  and winked one at another, biting their lips within their hats, and using more 
  the like unseemly gestures. After this, meat was brought in, and albeit none 
  could be seen, yet every thing was so orderly managed, that it seemed to me 
  as if every guest had had his proper attendant. Now my artists having somewhat 
  recruited themselves, and the wine having a little removed shame from their 
  hearts, they presently began to vaunt and brag of their abilities. One would 
  prove this, another that, and commonly the most sorry idiots made the loudest 
  noise. Ah, when I call to mind what preternatural and impossible enterprises 
  I then heard, I am still ready to vomit at it. In fine, they never kept in their 
  order, but when ever one rascal here, another there, could insinuate himself 
  in between the nobles; then pretended they the finishing of such adventures 
  as neither Sampson, nor yet Hercules with all their strength could ever have 
  achieved: this would discharge Atlas of his burden; the other would again draw 
  forth the three-headed Cerberus out of Hell. In brief, every man had his own 
  prate, and yet the great lords were so simple that they believed their pretences, 
  and the rogues so audacious, that although one or other of them was here and 
  there rapped over the fingers with a knife, yet they flinched not at it, but 
  when any one perchance had filched a gold-chain, then would all hazard for the 
  like. I saw one who heard the rustling of the heavens. The second could see 
  Plato's ideas. A third could number Democritus's atoms. There were also not 
  a few pretenders to the perpetual motion. Many an one (in my opinion) had good 
  understanding, but assumed too much to himself, to his own destruction Lastly, 
  there was one also who would needs out of hand persuade us that he saw the servitors 
  who attended, and would still have pursued his contention, had not one of those 
  invisible waiters reached him so handsom a cuff upon his lying muzzle, that 
  not only he, but many more who were by him, became as mute as mice. But it best 
  of all pleased me, that all those, of whom I had any esteem, were very quiet 
  in their business, and made no loud cry of it, but acknowledged themselves to 
  be misunderstanding men, to whom the mysteries of nature were too high, and 
  they themselves much too small. In this tumult I had almost cursed the day wherein 
  I came hither; for I could not but with anguish behold that those lewd vain 
  people were above at the board, but I in so sorry a place could not rest in 
  quiet, one of those rascals scornfully reproaching me for a motley fool. Now 
  I thought not that there was yet one gate behind, through which we must pass, 
  but imagined I was during the whole wedding, to continue in this scorn, contempt 
  and indignity, which yet I had at no time deserved, either of the Lord Bridegroom 
  or the Bride. And therefore (in my opinion) he should have done well to sort 
  out some other fool to his wedding than me. Behold, to such impatience cloth 
  the iniquity of this world reduce simple hearts. But this really was one part 
  of my lameness, whereof (as is before mentioned) I dreamed. And truly this clamour 
  the longer it lasted, the more it increased. For there were already those who 
  boasted of false and imaginary visions, and would persuade us of palpably lying 
  dreams. Now there sat by me a very fine quiet man, who oftentimes discoursed 
  of excellent matters. At length he said, &quot;Behold my brother, if any one 
  should now come who were willing to instruct these blockish people in the right 
  way, would he be heard? &quot;No, verily,&quot; replied I. &quot;The world&quot; 
  said he, &quot;is now resolved (whatever comes on it) to be cheated, and cannot 
  abide to give ear to those who intend its good. Seest thou also that same cocks-comb, 
  with what whimsical figures and foolish conceits he allures others to him. There 
  one makes mouthes at the people with the unheard-of mysterious words. Yet believe 
  me in this, the time is now coming when those shameful vizards shall be plucked 
  off, and all the world shall know what vagabond imposters were concealed behind 
  them. Then perhaps that will be valued which at present is not esteemed. &quot;Whilst 
  he was thus speaking, and the clamour the longer it lasted the worse it was, 
  all on a sudden there began in the hall such excellent and stately musick, as 
  all the days of my life I never heard the like; whereupon every one held his 
  peace, and attended what would become of it. Now there were in this music all 
  sorts of stringed instruments imaginable, which sounded together in such harmony, 
  that I forgot myself, and sat so unmovable, that those who sat by me were amazed 
  at me, and this lasted near half an hour, wherein none of us spoke one word. 
  For as soon as ever any one was about to open his mouth, he got an unexpected 
  blow, neither knew he from whence it came. Me thought since we were not permitted 
  to see the musicians, I should have been glad to view only all the instruments 
  they made use of. After half an hour this music ceased unexpectedly, and we 
  could neither see nor hear any thing further. Presently after, before the door 
  of the hall began a great noise sounding and beating of trumpets, shalms and 
  kettle-drums, also master-like, as if the Emperor of Rome had been entering; 
  whereupon the door opened of itself, and then the noise of the trumpets was 
  so loud, that we were hardly able to indure it. Meanwhile (to my thinking) many 
  thousand small tapers came into the hall, all which of themselves marched in 
  so very exact an order as altogether amazed us, till at last the two aforementioned 
  pages with bright torches, lighting in a most beautiful Virgin, all drawn on 
  a gloriously gilded triumphant self-moving throne, entered the hall. It seemed 
  to me she was the very same who before on the way kindled, and put out the lights, 
  and that these her attendants were the very same whom she formerly placed at 
  the trees. She was not now as before in skye-colour, but arrayed in a snow-white 
  glittering robe, which sparkled of pure gold, and cast such a lustre that we 
  durst not steadily behold it. Both the pages were after the same manner habited 
  (albeit somewhat more slightly). As soon as they were come into the middle of 
  the hall, and were descended from the throne, all the small tapers made obeisance 
  before her. Whereupon we all stood up from our benches, yet every one staid 
  in his own place. Now she having to us, and we again to her, shewed all respect 
  and reverence, in a most pleasant tone she began thus to speak;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;The King my Lord most gracious,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who now's not very far from us,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">As also his most lovely Bride,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">To him in troth and honour ti'd;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Already, with great joy indu'd,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Have your arrival hither view'd;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And do to every one,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">and all Promise their grace in special;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And from their very hearts desire,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">You may it at the same acquire;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That so their future nuptial joy</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">May mixed be with none's annoy.&quot;</P>
<P>Hereupon with all her small tapers she again courteously bowed, and presently 
  after began thus:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;In the invitation writ, you know</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That no man called was hereto</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who of God's rarest gifts good store</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Had not received long before,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Adorned with all requisit's,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">As in such cases it befit's.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">How though they cannot well conceit</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That any man's so desperate,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Under conditions so hard,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Here to intrude without regard;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Unless he have been first of all,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Prepared for this nuptial;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And therefore in good hopes do dwell</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That with all you it will be well.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Yet men are grown so bold, and rude,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Not weighing their inepitude,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">As still to thrust themselves in place</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Whereto none of them called was.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">No cocks-comb here himself may sell,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">No rascal in with others steal;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">For they resolve without all let</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A wedding pure to celebrate.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">So then the artists for to weigh</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Seals shall be fix'd the ensuing day;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Whereby each one may lightly find</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">What he hath left at home behind.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">If here be any of that rout</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who have good cause themselves to doubt,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Let him seek quickly hence aside;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">For that in ease he longer bide,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Of grace forelor'n, and quite undone</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Betimes he must the gauntlet run.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">If any now his conscience gall,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He shall tonight be left in th' hall</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And be again releas't by morn,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Yet so he hither ne'er return.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">If any man have confidence,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He with his waiter may go hence,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who shall him to his chamber light</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Where he may rest in peace tonight;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And there with praise await the scale</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Or else his sleep may chance to fail.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The others here may take it well,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">For who aim's 'bove what's possible,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">'Twere better much he hence had pas't,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">But of you all wee'l hope the best.&quot;</P>
<P>As soon as she had done speaking this, she again made reverence, and sprung 
  cheerfully into her throne, after which the trumpets began again to sound, which 
  yet was not of force to take from many their grievous sighs. So they again conducted 
  her invisibly away, but the most part of the small tapers remained in the room, 
  and still one of them accompanied each of us. In such perturbation 'tis not 
  well possible to express what pensive thoughts and gestures were amongst us. 
  Yet the most part were resolved to await the scale, and in ease things sorted 
  not well, to depart (as they hoped) in peace. I had soon cast up my reckoning, 
  and being my conscience convinced me of all ignorance, and unworthiness, I purposed 
  to stay with the rest in the hall, and chose much rather to content myself with 
  the meal I had already taken, than to run the risk of a future repulse. Now 
  after that every one by his small taper had severally been conducted into a 
  chamber (each as I since understood into a peculiar one), there stayed nine 
  of us, and amongst the rest he also, who discoursed with me at the table. But 
  although our small tapers left us not, yet soon after within an hours time one 
  of the aforementioned pages came in, and bringing a great bundle of cords with 
  him, first demanded of us whether we had concluded to stay there, which when 
  we had with sighs affirmed, he bound each of us in a several place, and so went 
  away with our small tapers, and left us poor wretches in darkness. Then some 
  first began to perceive the imminent danger, and I my self could not refrain 
  tears. For although we were not forbidden to speak, yet anguish and affliction 
  suffered none of us to utter one word. For the cords were so wonderfully made, 
  yet none could cut them, much less get them off his feet. Yet this comforted 
  me, that still the future gain, of many an one, who had now betaken himself 
  to rest, would prove very little to his satisfaction. But we by only one nights 
  penance might expiate all our presumption; till at length in my sorrowful thoughts 
  I fell asleep, during which I had a dream. Now although there be no great matter 
  in it, yet I esteem it not impertinent to recount it. Me thought I was upon 
  an high mountain, and saw before me a great and large valley. In this valley 
  were gathered together an unspeakable multitude of people, each of which had 
  at his head a thread, by which he was hanged up towards Heaven, now one hung 
  high, another low, some stood even quite upon the earth. But in the air there 
  flew up and down an ancient man, who had in his hand a pair of sheers, wherewith 
  here he cut one's, and there another's thread. Now he that was nigh the earth 
  was so much the readier, and fell without noise, but when it happened to one 
  of the high ones, he fell, so that the earth quaked. To some it came to pass 
  that their thread was no stretched, that they came to the earth before the thread 
  was cut. I took pleasure in this tumbling, and it joyed me at the heart, when 
  he who had over-exalted himself in the air, of his wedding, got so shameful 
  a fall, that it carried even some of his neighbours along with him. In like 
  manner it also rejoiced me, that he who had all this while kept himself near 
  the earth, could come down so fine and gently, that even his next men perceived 
  it not. But being now in my highest fit of jolity, I was unawares jogged by 
  one of my fellow captives, upon which I was awaked, and was very much discontented 
  with him. Howbeit, I considered my dream, and recounted it to my brother, who 
  lay by me on the other side, who was not dissatisfied with it, but hoped some 
  comfort might thereby be pretended. In such discourse we spent the remaining 
  part of the night, and with longing expected the day.</P>
<B> 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Third Day</FONT></P>
</B> 
<P>Now as soon as the lovely day was broken, and the bright sun, having raised 
  himself above the hills, had again betaken himself, in the high heaven, to his 
  appointed office, my good champions began to rise out of their beds, and leisurely 
  to make themselves ready unto the inquisition. Whereupon, one after another, 
  they came again into the hall, and giving us a good morrow, demanded how we 
  had slept; and having espied our bonds, there were some that reproved us for 
  being so cowardly, and that we had not, as they, hazarded upon all adventures. 
  Howbeit, same of them whose hearts still smote them made no loud cry of the 
  business. We excused ourselves with our ignorance, hoping we should now be set 
  at liberty, and learn wit by this disgrace, that they on the contrary had not 
  yet altogether escaped, and perhaps their greatest danger was still to be expected. 
  At length each one being assembled, the trumpets began now again to sound and 
  the kettle drums to beat as formerly, and we then imagined no other but that 
  the Bridegroom was ready to present himself; which nevertheless was a huge mistake. 
  For it was again the yesterday's Virgin who had arrayed her self all in red 
  velvet, and girded her self with a white scarfe. Upon her head she had a green 
  wreath of laurel, which hugely became her. Her train was now no more of small 
  tapers, but consisted of two hundred men in harness, who were all (like her) 
  cloathed in red and white. Now as soon as they were alighted from the throne, 
  she comes straight to us prisoners, and after she had saluted us, she said in 
  few words, &quot;That some of you have been sensible of your wretched condition 
  is hugely pleasing to my most mighty Lord, and he is also resolved you shall 
  fare the better for it.&quot; And having espied me in my habit, she laughed 
  and spake, &quot;Good lack! hast thou also submitted thy self to the yoke, I 
  imagined thou wouldst have made thy self very smug,&quot; with which words she 
  caused my eyes to run over. After which she commanded we should be unbound, 
  and coupled together and placed in a station where we might well behold the 
  scales. &quot;For,&quot; said she, &quot;it may yet fare better with them, than 
  the presumptuous, who yet stand here at liberty.&quot; Mean time the scales 
  which were intirely of gold were hung up in the midst of the hall. There was 
  also a little table covered with red velvet, and seven weights placed thereon. 
  First of all stood a pretty great one, next four little ones; lastly, two great 
  ones severally. And these weights in proportion to their bulk were so heavy, 
  that no man can believe or comprehend it. But each of the harnessed men had 
  together with a naked sword a strong rope. These she distributed according to 
  the number; of weights into seven bands and out of every band chose one for 
  their proper weight; and then again sprung up into her high throne. Now as soon 
  as she had made her reverence, with a very shrill tone she began thus to speak:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&quot;Who int' a painters room does go</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And nothing does of painting know,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Yet does in prating thereof, pride it;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Shall be of all the world derided.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who into th' artists order goes,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And &quot;hereunto was never chose;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Yet with pretence of skill does pride it;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Shall be of all the world derided.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who at a wedding does appear,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And yet was ner'e intended there;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Yet does in coming highly pride it;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Shall be of all the world derided.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who now into this scale ascends,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The weights not proving his fast friends,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And that it bounces so does ride it;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Shall be of all the world derided.&quot;</P>
<P>As soon as the Virgin had done speaking, one of the Pages commanded each one 
  to place himself according to his order, and one after another to step in: which 
  one of the emperors made no scruple of, but first of all bowed himself a little 
  towards the Virgin, and afterwards in all his stately attire went up: whereupon 
  each captain laid in his weight; which (to the wonder of all) he stood out. 
  But the last was too heavy for him, so that forth he must, and that with much 
  anguish that (as it seemed to me) the Virgin her self had pity on him, who also 
  beckoned to her people to hold their peace, yet was the good emperor bound and 
  delivered over to the sixth band. Next him again came forth another emperor, 
  who steps hautily into the scale, and having a great thick book under his gown, 
  he imagined not to fail. But being scarce able to abide the third weight, and 
  being unmercifully flung down, and his book in that affrightment flipping from 
  him, all the soldiers began to laugh, and he was delivered up bound to the third 
  band. Thus it went also with some others of the emperors who were all shamefully 
  laughed at and captived. After these comes forth a little short man with a curled 
  brown beard, an emperor too, who after the usual reverence got up also, and 
  held out so steadfastly, that me thought, and there been more weights ready, 
  he would have outstood them; to whom the Virgin immediately arose, and bowed 
  before him, causing him to put on a gown of red velvet, and at last reached 
  him a branch of laurel, having good store of them upon her throne, upon the 
  steps whereof she willed him to sit down. Now how, after him it fared with the 
  rest of the emperors, kings and lords, would be too long to recount; but I cannot 
  leave unmentioned that few of those great personages held out. Howbeit sundry 
  eminent virtues (beyond my hopes) were found in many. One could stand out this, 
  the second another, some two, some three, four or five, but few could attain 
  to the just perfection; but everyone who failed, was miserably laughed at by 
  the bands. After the inquisition had also passed over the gentry, the learned, 
  and unlearned, and the rest, and in each condition perhaps one, it may be, two, 
  but for the most part none, was found perfect, it came at length to those honest 
  gentlemen the vagabond cheaters, and rascally <I>Lapidem Spitalanficum</I> makers, 
  who were set upon the scale with such scorn, that I my self for all my grief 
  was ready to burst my belly with laughing, neither could the very prisoners 
  themselves refrain. For the most part could not abide that severe trial, but 
  with whips and scourges were jerked out of the scale, and led to the other prisoners, 
  yet to a suitable band. Thus of so great a throng so few remained, that I am 
  ashamed to discover their number. Howbeit there were persons of quality also 
  amongst them, who notwithstanding were (like the rest) honoured with velvet 
  robes and wreaths of laurel.</P>
<P>The inquisition being completely finished, and none but we poor coupled hounds 
  standing aside, at length one of the captains stepped forth, and said, Gratious 
  Madam, if it please your ladyship let these poor men, who acknowledged their 
  mis-understanding, be set upon the scale also without their incurring any danger 
  of penalty, and only for recreation's sake, if perchance any thing that is right 
  may be found amongst them. In the first place I was in great perplexity, for 
  in my anguish this was my only comfort, that I was not to stand in such ignominy, 
  or to be lashed out of the scale. For I nothing doubted but that many of the 
  prisoners wished that they had stay'd ten nights with us in the hall. Yet since 
  the Virgin consented, so it must be, and we being untied were one after another 
  set up. Now although the most part miscarried, yet they were neither laughed 
  at, nor scourged, but peaceably placed on one side. My companion was the fifth, 
  who held out bravely, whereupon all, but especially the captain who made the 
  request for us, applauded him, and the Virgin shewed him the usual respect. 
  After him again two more were dispatched in an instant. But I was the eighth. 
  Now as soon as (with trembling) I stepped up, my companion who already sat by 
  in his velvet, looked friendly upon me, and the Virgin her self smiled a little. 
  But for as much as I out-stayed all the weights, the Virgin commanded them to 
  draw me up by force, wherefore three men moreover hung on the other side of 
  the beam, and yet could nothing prevail. Whereupon one of the Pages immediately 
  stood up, and cried out exceeding loud, THAT IS HE. Upon which the other replied, 
  Then let him gain his liberty, which the Virgin accorded; and being received 
  with due ceremonies, the choice was given me to release one of the captives, 
  whosoever I pleased; whereupon I made no long deliberation, but elected the 
  first emperor whom I had long pittied, who was immediately set free, and with 
  all respect seated amongst us. Now the last being set up, and the weights proving 
  too heavy for him, in the mean while the Virgin espied my roses, which I had 
  taken out of my hat into my hands, and thereupon presently by her Page graciously 
  requested them of me, which I readily sent her. And so this first act was finished 
  about ten in the fore-noon. Whereupon the trumpets began to sound again, which 
  nevertheless we could not as yet see. Mean time the bands were to step aside 
  with their prisoners, and expect the judgement. After which a council of the 
  seven captains and us was set, and the business was propounded by the Virgin 
  as president, who desired each one to give his opinion, how the prisoners were 
  to be dealt with. The first opinion was that they should all be put to death, 
  yet one more severely than another: namely those who had presumptuously intruded 
  themselves contrary to the express conditions; others would have them kept close 
  prisoners. Both which pleased neither the president nor me. At length by one 
  of the emperors (the same whom I had freed) my companion, and my self the affair 
  was brought to this point; that first of all the principal lords should with 
  a befitting respect be led out of the castle; others might be carried out somewhat 
  more scornfully. These would be stripped and caused to run out naked. The fourth 
  with rods, whips or dogs, should be hunted out. Those who the day before willingly 
  surrendered themselves, might be suffered to depart without any blame. And last 
  of all those presumptuous ones, and they who behaved themselves so unseemly 
  at dinner the day before, should be punished in body and life according to each 
  man's demerit. This opinion pleased the Virgin well, and obtained the upper 
  hand. There was moreover another dinner vouchsafed them, which they were soon 
  acquainted with. But the execution was deferred till twelve at noon. Herewith 
  the senate arose, and the Virgin also, together with her attendants returned 
  to her usual quarter. But the uppermost table in the room was allotted to us, 
  they requesting us to take it in good part till the business were fully dispatched. 
  And then we should be conducted to the Lord Bridegroom and the Bride, with which 
  we were at present well content. Mean time the prisoners were again brought 
  into the hall, and each man seated according to his quality; they were likewise 
  enjoined to behave themselves somewhat more civilly than they had done the day 
  before, which yet they needed not to have been admonished, for without this, 
  they had already put up their pipes. And this I can boldly say, not with flattery, 
  but in the love of truth, that commonly those persons who were of the highest 
  rank, best understood how to behave themselves in so unexpected a misfortune. 
  Their treatment was but indifferent, yet with respect, neither could they yet 
  see their attendants, but to us they were visible, whereat I was exceeding joyful. 
  Now although fortune had exalted us, yet we took not upon us more than the rest, 
  advising them to be of good cheer, the event would not be so ill. Now although 
  they would gladly have understood the sentence of us, yet we were so deeply 
  obliged that none durst open his mouth about it. Nevertheless we comforted them 
  as well we could, drinking with them to try if the wine might make them any 
  thing cheerfuller. Our table was covered with red velvet, beset with drinking 
  cups of pure silver and gold, which the rest could not behold without amazement 
  and very great anguish. But e'er we had seated ourselves, in came the two Pages, 
  presenting every one in the Bride-groom's behalf, the Golden Fleece with a flying 
  lion, requesting us to wear them at the table, and as became us to observe the 
  reputation and dignity of the order, which his majesty had now vouchsafed us, 
  and should suddenly be ratified with suitable ceremony. This we received with 
  profoundest submission, promising obediently to perform whatsoever his Majesty 
  should please. Besides these, the noble Page had a schedule, wherein we were 
  set down in order. And for my part I should not otherwise be desirous to conceal 
  my place, if perchance it might not be interpreted to pride in me, which yet 
  is expressly against the fourth weight. Now because our entertainment was exceedingly 
  stately, we demanded one of the Pages, whether we might not have leave to send 
  some choice bit to our friends and acquaintance, who making no difficulty of 
  it, every one sent plentifully to his acquaintance by the waiters, howbeit they 
  saw none of them; and forasmuch as they knew not whence it came, I we. my self 
  desirous to carry somewhat to one of them, but as soon as I was risen, one of 
  the waiters was presently at my elbow, saying he desired me to take friendly 
  warning, for in case one of the Pages had seen it, it would have come to the 
  King's ear, who would certainly have taken it amiss of me; but since none had 
  observed it but himself, he purposed not to betray me, but that I ought for 
  the time to come to have better regard to the dignity of the order. With which 
  words the servant did really so astonish me, that for a long time after I scarce 
  moved upon my seat, yet I returned him thanks for his faithful warning, as well 
  as in haste and affright I was able. Soon after the drums began to beat again, 
  to which we were already accustomed: for we well knew it was the Virgin, wherefore 
  we prepared ourselves to receive her, who was now coming in with her usual train, 
  upon her high seat, one of the Pages bearing before her a very tall goblet of 
  gold, and the other a patent in parchment. Being now after a marvellous artificial 
  manner alighted from the seat, she takes the goblet from the Page, and presents 
  the same in the King's behalf, saying, that it was brought from his Majesty, 
  and that in honour of him we should cause it to go round. Upon the cover of 
  this goblet stood Fortune curiously cast in gold, who had in her hand a red 
  flying ensign, for which cause I drunk somewhat the more sadly, as having been 
  but too well acquainted with Fortune's way-wardness. But the Virgin as well 
  as we, was adorned with the Golden Fleece and lion, whence I observed, that 
  perhaps she wan the president of the order. Wherefore we demanded of her how 
  the order might be named? She answered that it was not yet seasonable to discover 
  it, till the affair with the prisoners were dispatched. And therefore their 
  eyes were still held, and what had hitherto happened to us, was to them only 
  for an offence and scandal, although it were to be accounted as nothing, in 
  regard of the honour that attended us. Hereupon she began to distinguish the 
  patent which the other Page held into two different parts, out of which about 
  thus much was read before the first company. </P>
<P>That they should confess that they had too lightly given credit to fictitious 
  books, had assumed too much to themselves, and so came into this castle, albeit 
  they were never invited into it, and perhaps the most part had presented themselves 
  with design to make their market here, and afterwards to live in the greater 
  pride and lordliness; and thus one had seduced another, and plunged him into 
  this disgrace and ignominy, wherefore they were deservedly to be soundly punished. 
  Which they with great humility readily acknowledged, and gave their hands upon 
  it. After which a severe check was given to the rest, much to this purpose.</P>
<P>That they very well knew, and were in their consciences convinced, that they 
  had forged false fictitious books, had befooled others, and cheated them, and 
  thereby had diminished regal dignity amongst all. They knew in like manner what 
  ungodly deceitful figures they had made use of, in so much a. they spared not 
  even the Divine Trinity. but accustomed themselves to cheat people the country 
  over. It was also now as clear as day with what practices they had endeavoured 
  to ensnare the true guests, and introduce the ignorant: in like manner, that 
  it was manifest to all the world, that they wallowed in open whoredom, adultery, 
  gluttony, and other uncleannesses. All which was against the express orders 
  of our kingdom. In brief, they knew they had disparaged kingly majesty, even 
  amongst the common sort, and therefore they should confess themselves to be 
  manifest convicted vagabond-cheaters, knaves and rascals, whereby they deserved 
  to be cashiered from the company of civil people, and severely to be punished.</P>
<P>The good artists were loath to come to this confession, but inasmuch as not 
  only the Virgin her self threatened, and swore their death, but the other party 
  also vehemently raged at them, and unanimously cryed out, that they had most 
  wickedly seduced them out of the Light, they at length, to prevent a huge misfortune, 
  confessed the same with dolour, and yet withal alledged that what had herein 
  happened was not to be animadverted upon them in the worst sense. For in as 
  much as the lords were absolutely resolved to get into the castle, and had promised 
  great sums of money to that effect, each one had used all craft to seize upon 
  something, and so things were brought to that pass, as was now manifest before 
  their eyes. But that it succeeded not, they in their opinion had dis-deserved 
  no more than the lords themselves; as who should have had so much understanding 
  as to consider that in case any one had been sure of getting in, he would not, 
  in so great peril, for the sake of a slight gain, have clambered over the wall 
  with them. Their books also sold so mightily, that whoever had no other mean 
  to maintain himself, was fain to engage in such a cousenage. They hoped moreover, 
  that if a right judgment were made, they should be found no way to have miscarried, 
  as having behaved themselves towards the lords, as became servants, upon their 
  earnest entreaty. But answer was made them, that his Royal Majesty had determined 
  to punish all, and every man, albeit one more severely than another. For although 
  what had been alledged by them was partly true, and therefore the lords should 
  not wholly be indulged, yet they had good reason to prepare themselves for death, 
  who had so presumptuously obtruded themselves, and perhaps seduced the more 
  ignorant against their will; as likewise they who with false books had violated 
  royal majesty, as the same might be evinced out of their very writings and books.</P>
<P>Hereupon many began most pitteously to lament, cry, weep, entreat, and prostrate 
  themselves, all which notwithstanding could avail them nothing, and I much marvelled 
  how the Virgin could be so resolute, when yet their misery caused our eyes to 
  run over, and moved our compassion (although the most part of them had procured 
  us much trouble, and vexation). For she presently dispatched her Page, who brought 
  with him all the curiassiers which had this day been appointed at the scales, 
  who were commanded each of them to take his own to him, and in an orderly procession, 
  so as still each curiassier should go with one of the prisoners, to conduct 
  them into her great garden. At which time each one so exactly recognised his 
  own man, that I marvelled at it. Leave also was likewise given to my yesterday 
  companions to go out into the garden unbound, and to be present at the execution 
  of the sentence. Now as soon as every man was come forth, the Virgin mounted 
  up into her high throne, requesting us to sit down upon the steps, and to appear 
  at the judgment, which we refused not, but left all standing upon the table 
  (except the goblet, which the Virgin committed to the Pages keeping) and went 
  forth in our robes upon the throne, which of it self moved so gently as if we 
  had passed in the air, till in this manner we came into the garden, where we 
  arose altogether. This garden was not extraordinary curious, only it pleased 
  me that the trees were planted in so good order. Besides there ran in it a most 
  costly fountain, adorned with wonderful figures and inscriptions, and strange 
  characters (which God willing I shall mention in a future book). In this garden 
  was raised a wooden scaffold, hung about with curiously painted figured coverlets. 
  Now there were four galleries made one over another, the first more glorious 
  than any of the rest, and therefore covered with a white taffeta curtain, so 
  that at that time we could not perceive who-was behind it. The second was empty 
  and uncovered. Again the two last were covered with red and blew taffeta. Now 
  as noon as we were come to the scaffold, the Virgin bowed her self down to the 
  ground, at which we were mightily terrified: for we might easily guess that 
  the King and Queen must not be far off. Now we also having duely performed our 
  reverence, the Virgin lead us up by the winding stairs into the second gallery, 
  where she placed herself uppermost, and us in our former order. But how the 
  emperor whom I had released, behaved himself towards me, both at this time as 
  also before at the table, I cannot, without slander of wicked tongues, well 
  relate. For he might well imagine in what anguish and sollicitude he now should 
  have been, in case he were at present to attend the judgment with such ignominies 
  and that only through me he hast not attained such dignity and worthiness. Mean 
  time the virgin who first of all brought me the invitation, and whom hitherto 
  I had never since seen, stepped in. First she gave one blast upon her trumpet, 
  and then with a very loud voice declared the sentence in this manner.</P>
<P>The Kings Majesty my most gratious Lord could from his heart wish, that all 
  and every one here assembled, held upon his Majesty's invitation presented themselves 
  so qualified, as that they might (to his honour) with greatest frequently have 
  adorned this his appointed nuptial and joyful feast. But since it hath otherwise 
  pleased Almighty God, his Majesty hath not whereat to murmur, but must be forced, 
  contrary to his own inclination, to abide by the ancient and laudable constitutions 
  of this Kingdom. But now, that his Majesty's innate clemency may be celebrated 
  over all the world, he hath thus far absolutely dealt with his council and estates, 
  that the usual sentence shall be considerably lenified. So that in the first 
  place he in willing to vouchsafe to the lords and potentates, not only their 
  lives entirely, but also freely and frankly to dismiss them, friendly and courteously 
  entreating your lordships not at all to take it in evil part that you cannot 
  be present at his Majesty's Feast of Honour; but to remember that there in notwithstanding 
  more imposed upon your lordship. by God Almighty (who in the distribution of 
  his gifts hath an incomprehensible consideration) than you can duely and easily 
  sustain. Neither is your reputation hereby prejudiced, although you be rejected 
  by this our order, since we cannot at once all of us, do all things. But for 
  as much as your lordships have been seduced by base rascals, it shall not on 
  their part, pass unrevenged. And furthermore his Majesty resolveth shortly to 
  communicate with your lordships a catalogue of hereticks or Index Expurgatorius, 
  that you may hence forward be able with better judgment to discern between the 
  good and the evil. And because his Majesty e're long also purposeth to rummage 
  his library, and offer up the reductive writings to Vulcan, he friendly, humbly, 
  and courteously entreats every one of your lordships to put the name in execution 
  with your own, whereby it is to be hoped that all evil and mischief may for 
  the time to come be remedied. And you are withal to be admonished, never henceforth 
  so inconsiderately to covet an entrance hither, least the former excuse of seducers 
  be taken from you, and you fall into disgrace and contempt of all men. In fine, 
  for as much as the estates of the land have still somewhat to demand of your 
  lordships, his Majesty hopes that no man will think much to redeem himself with 
  a chain or what else he hath about him, and so in friendly manner to depart 
  from us, and through our safe conduct to betake himself home again.</P>
<P>The others who stood not at the first, third and fourth weight, his Majesty 
  will not no lightly dismiss. But that they also may now experience his Majesty's 
  gentleness, it is his command, to strip them stark naked and so send them forth. 
</P>
<P>Those who in the second and fifth weight were found too light, shall besides 
  stripping, be noted with one, two or more brand-marks, according as each one 
  was lighter, or heavier. </P>
<P>They who were drawn up by the sixth or seventh, and not by the rest, shall 
  be somewhat more gratiously dealt withal, and so forward. For unto every combination 
  there was a certain punishment ordained, which were here too long to recount. 
</P>
<P>They who yesterday separated themselves freely of their own accord, shall go 
  at liberty without any blame. </P>
<P>Finally, the convicted vagabond-cheaters who could move up none of the weights, 
  shall as occasion serves, be punished in body and life, with the sword, halter, 
  water and rods. And such execution of judgment shall be inviolably observed 
  for an example unto others.</P>
<P>Herewith our Virgin broke her wand, and the other who read the sentence, blowed 
  her trumpet, and stepped with most profound reverence towards those who stood 
  behind the curtain. But here I cannot omit to discover somewhat to the reader 
  concerning the number of our prisoners, of whom those who weighed one, were 
  seven; those who weighed two, were twenty one; they who three, thirty five; 
  they who four, thirty five; those who five, twenty one; those who six, seven; 
  but he that came to the seventh, and yet could not well raise it, he was only 
  one, and indeed the same whom I released. Besides, of them who wholly failed 
  there were many. But of those who drew all the weights from the ground, but 
  few. And these as they stood severally before us, no I diligently numbered, 
  and noted them down in my table-book. And it is very admirable that amongst 
  those who weighed any thing, none was equal to another. For although amongst 
  those who weighed three, there were thirty five, yet one of them weighed the 
  first, second, and third, another the third, fourth, and fifth, a third, the 
  fifth, sixth and seventh and so on. It is likewise very wonderful that amongst 
  one hundred and twenty six who weighed any thing, none was equal to another. 
  And I would very willingly name them all, with each mans weight, were it not 
  as yet forbidden me. But I hope it may hereafter be published with the interpretation.</P>
<P>Now this Judgment being read over, the lords in the first place were well satisfied, 
  because in such severity they durst not look for a mild sentence. For which 
  cause they gave more than they were desired, and each one redeemed himself with 
  chains, jewels, gold, monies and other things, as much as they had about them, 
  and with reverence took leave. Now although the King's servants were forbidden 
  to jear any at his going away, yet some unlucky birds could not hold laughing, 
  and certainly it was sufficiently ridiculous to see them pack away with such 
  speed, without once looking behind them. Some desired that the promised catalogue 
  might with the first be dispatched after them, and then they would take such 
  order with their books as should be pleasing to his Majesty; which was again 
  assured. At the door was given to each of them out of a cup a draught of FORGETFULNESS, 
  that so he might have no further memory of misfortune.</P>
<P>After these the voluntiers departed, who because of their ingenuity were suffered 
  to pass, but yet so as never to return again in the same fashion. But if to 
  them (as likewise to the others) any thing further were revealed, then they 
  should become well-come guests.</P>
<P>Mean while others were stripping, in which also an inequality(according to 
  each man's demerit) was observ'd. Some were sent away naked, without other hurt. 
  Others were driven out with small bells. Some were scourged forth. In brief 
  the punishments were so various, that I am not able to recount them all. In 
  the end it came to the last also with whom somewhat a longer time was spent, 
  for whilst some were hanging, some beheading, some forced to leap into the water, 
  and the rest otherwise dispatching, much time was consumed. Verily at this execution 
  my eyes ran over, not indeed in regard of the punishment, which they otherwise 
  for their impudency well deserved, but in contemplation of human blindness, 
  in that we are continually busting ourselves in that which ever since the first 
  Fall hath been hitherto sealed up to us. Thus the garden which so lately was 
  quite full, was soon emptied; so that besides the soldier there was not a man 
  left. Now as soon as this was done, and silence had been kept for the space 
  of five minutes, there came forward a beautiful snow-white unicorn with a golden 
  coller (having it in certain letters) about his neck. In the same place he bowed 
  himself down upon both his fore-feet, as if hereby he had shown honour to the 
  lion, who stood so immoveably upon the fountain, that I took him to be of stone 
  or brass, who immediately took the naked sword which he bare in his paw, and 
  brake it in the middle in two, the piece. whereof to my thinking sunk into the 
  fountain: after which he so long roared, until a white dove brought a branch 
  of olive in her bill, which the lion devoured in an instant, and so was quieted. 
  And so the unicorn returned to his place with joy. Hereupon our Virgin lead 
  us down again by the winding stairs from the scaffold, and so we again made 
  our reverence toward the curtain. We were to wash our hands and heads in the 
  fountain, and there a little while to wait in our order till the King through 
  a certain secret gallery were again returned into his hall and then we also 
  with choice music, pomp, state and pleasant discourse were conducted into our 
  former lodging. And this was done about four in the afternoon. But that in the 
  meanwhile the time might not seem too long to us, the Virgin bestowed on each 
  of us a noble page, who were not only richly habited, but also exceedingly learned, 
  so that they could so aptly discourse upon all subjects, that we had good reason 
  to be ashamed of our selves. These were commanded to lead us up and down the 
  castle yet but into certain places and if possible, to shorten the time according 
  to our desire. Mean time the Virgin took leave with this consolation, that at 
  supper she would be with us again, and after that celebrate the ceremonies of 
  the hanging up of the weights, requesting that we would in patience waite till 
  the next day, for on the morrow we must be presented to the King. She being 
  thus departed from us, each of us did what best pleased him. One part viewed 
  the excellent paintings, which they copied out for themselves, and considered 
  also what the wonderful characters might signify. Others were fain to recruit 
  themselves again with meat and drink. I indeed caused my page to conduct me 
  (together with my companion) up and down the castle, of which walk it will never 
  repent me as long as I have a day to live. For besides many other glorious antiquities, 
  the royal sepulcher was also shewed me, by which I learned more than is extant 
  in all books. There in the same place stands also the glorious Phoenix (of which 
  two years since I published a particular small discourse) and Am resolved (in 
  case this my narration shall prove useful) to set forth several and peculiar 
  treatises, concerning the Lion, Eagle, Griffon, Falcon and other like, together 
  with their draughts and inscriptions. It grieves me also for my other conforts, 
  that they neglected such pretious treasures. And yet I cannot but think it was 
  the special will of God it should be so. I indeed reaped the most benefit by 
  my page, for according as each ones genius lay, so he lead his intrusted into 
  the quarters and places which were pleasing to him. Now the keys hereunto belonging 
  were committed to my page, and therefore this good fortune happened to me before 
  the rest; for although he invited others to come in, yet they imagining such 
  tombs to be only in the churchyard, thought they would well enough get thither, 
  when ever any thing was to be seen there. Neither shall these monuments (as 
  both of us copied and transcribed them) be withheld from my thankful scholars. 
  The other thing that was shewed us two was the noble library as it was altogether 
  before the Reformation. Of which (albeit it rejoices my heart as often as I 
  call it to mind) I have so much the less to say, because the catalogue thereof 
  in very shortly to be published. At the entry of this room stands a great book, 
  the like whereof I never saw, in which all the figures, rooms, portals, also 
  all the writings, riddles ant the like, to be seen in the whole castle, are 
  delineated. Now although we made some promise concerning this also, yet at present 
  I must contain my self, and first learn to know the world better. In every book 
  stands its author painted, whereof (as I understood) many were to be burnt, 
  that so even their memory may be blotted out from amongst the righteous. Now 
  having taken a full view hereof, and being scarce gotten forth, another page 
  came running to us, and having whispered somewhat in our pages ear, he delivered 
  up the keys to him, who immediately carried them up the winding stair. But our 
  page was very much out of countenance, and we setting hard upon him with entreaties, 
  he declared to us that the King's Majesty would by no means permit that either 
  of the two, namely the library and sepulchers, should be seen by any man and 
  therefore he besought us as we tendered his life, to discover it to no man, 
  he having already utterly denyed it. Whereupon both of us stood hovering between 
  joy and fear, yet it continued in silence, and no man made further inquiry about 
  it. Thus in both places we consumed three hours, which does not at all repent 
  me. Now although it had already struck seven, yet nothing was hitherto given 
  us to eat, howbeit our hunger was easie to be abated by constant revivings, 
  and I could be well content to fast all my life long with such entertainment. 
  About this time the curious fountains, mines, and all kind of art-shops, were 
  also shown us, of which there was none but surpassed all our arts, though they 
  should all be melted into one mass. All their chambers were built in semi-circle, 
  that so they might have before their eyes the costly clock-work which was erected 
  upon a fair turret in the center, and regulate themselves according to the course 
  of the planets, which were to be seen on it in a glorious manner. And hence 
  I could easily conjecture wherein our artists failed, howbeit its none of my 
  duty to inform them. At length I came into a spacious room (shown indeed to 
  the rest a great while before) in the middle whereof stood a terrestrial globe, 
  whose diameter contained thirty foot, albeit near half of it, except a little 
  which was covered with the steps, was let into the earth. Two men might readily 
  turn this globe about with all its furniture, so that more of it was never to 
  be seen, but so much as was above the horizon. Now although I could easily conceive 
  that this was of some special use, yet could I not understand whereto those 
  ringlets of gold (which were upon it in several places) served; at which my 
  page laughed and advised me to view them more narrowly. In brief, I found there 
  my native country noted with gold also. Whereupon my companion sought his, and 
  found that so too. Now for as much as the same happened in like manner to the 
  rest who stood by, the page told us of a certain that it was yesterday declared 
  to the Kings Majest'y by their old Atlas (so is the astronomer named) that all 
  the gilded points did exactly answer to their native countries, according as 
  had been shown of each of them. And therefore he also, as soon as he perceived 
  that I undervalued my self and that nevertheless there stood a point upon my 
  native country, moved one of the captains to intreat for us, that we should 
  be set upon the scale (without our peril) at all adventures; especially seeing 
  one of our native countries had a notable good mark. And truly it was not without 
  cause that he, the page who had the greatest power of all the rest, was bestowed 
  on me. For this I then returned him thanks, and immediately looked more diligently 
  upon my native country, and found more over that besides the ringlet, there 
  were also certain delicate streaks upon it, which nevertheless I would not be 
  thought to speak to my own praise or glory. I saw much more too upon this globe 
  than I am willing to discover. Let each man take into consideration why each 
  city produceth not a philosopher. After this he lead us quite into the globe, 
  which was thus made. On the sea was a tablet, whereon stood three dedications, 
  and the author's name, which a man might gently lift up and by a little joyned 
  board, go into the center, which was capable of four persons, being nothing 
  but a round board whereon we could sit and at ease by broad daylight (it was 
  now already dark) contemplate the stars.</P>
<P>To my thinking they were mere carbuncles which glittered in an agreeable order, 
  and moved so gallantly, that I had scarce any mind ever to go out again, as 
  the page afterwards told the Virgin, with which she often twitched me. For it 
  was already supper time, and I had so much amused my self in the globe, that 
  I was almost the last at table; wherefore I made no longer delay, but having 
  again put on my gown (which I had before laid aside) and stepping to the table, 
  the waiters treated me with so much reverence and honour, that for shame I durst 
  not look up, and so unawares permitted the Virgin, who attended me on one side, 
  to stand, which she soon perceiving twitched me by the gown, and so led me to 
  the table. To speak any further concerning the music, or the rest of that magnificent 
  entertainment, I hold it needless both because it is not possible sufficently 
  to express it, and I have above reported it according so my power. In brief, 
  there was nothing there but art and amenity. Now after we had each to other 
  related our employment since noon ( howbeit, not a word was spoken of the library 
  and monuments) being already merry with the wine the Virgin began thus: &quot;My 
  lords, I have a great contention with one of my sisters. In our chamber we have 
  an eagle. Now we cherish him with such diligence. that each of us in desirous 
  to be the best beloved, and upon that score have many a squabble. On a day we 
  concluded to go both together to him, and toward whom he should show himself 
  most friendly, hers should he properly be; this we did. and I (as commonly) 
  bare in my hand a branch of laurel, but my sister had none. Now as soon as he 
  espied us both, he immediately gave my sister another branch which he had in 
  his beak, and offered at mine, which I gave him. Now each of us hereupon imagined 
  her self to be best beloved of him. Which way am I to resolve my self?&quot; 
  This modest proposal of the Virgin pleased us all mighty well and each one would 
  gladly have heard the solution, but in as much as they all looked upon me. and 
  desired to have the beginning from me, my mind was so extremely confounded that 
  I knew not what else to do with it but propound another in its stead. and therefore 
  said, &quot;Gracious Lady, your ladyships question were easily to be resolved 
  if one thing did not perplex me. I had two companions, both which loved me exceedingly; 
  now they being doubtful which of them was most dear to me, concluded to run 
  to me unaware, and that he whom I should then embrace should be the right; this 
  they did, yet one of them could not keep pace with the other, so he staid behind 
  and wept; the other I embraced with amazement. Now when they had afterwards 
  discovered the business to me, I knew not how to resolve myself and have hitherto 
  let it rest in this manner, until I may find some good advice herein.&quot; 
  The Virgin wondered at it, and well observed where about I was. whereupon she 
  replied, &quot;well then let us both be quit,&quot; and then desired the solution 
  from the rest. But I had already made them wise. Whereupon the next began thus: 
  &quot;In the city where I live, a virgin was lately condemned to death, but 
  the judge being something pitiful towards her, caused it to be proclaimed that 
  if any man desired to become the virgin's champion, he should have free leave 
  to do it. Now she had two lovers; the one presently made himself ready, and 
  came into the lists to expect his adversary; afterwards the other also presented 
  himself. but coming somewhat too late, he resolved nevertheless to fight, and 
  willingly suffer himself to be vanquished, that so the virgin's life might be 
  preserved, which also succeeded according. Whereupon each challenged her. Now 
  my lords instruct me, to which of them of right belongeth she &quot;The Virgin 
  could hold no longer, but said, I thought to have gained much information, and 
  am my self gotten into the net but yet would gladly hear whether there be any 
  more behind. &quot;Yes, that there is &quot; answered a third,&quot; a stranger 
  adventure hath not been yet recounted than that which happened to my self. In 
  my youth I loved a worthy maid. Now that this my love might attain its wished 
  end, I was fain to make use of an ancient matron, who easily brought me to her. 
  Now it happened that the maid's brethren came in upon us just as we three were 
  together, who were in such a rage that they would have taken my life, but upon 
  my vehement supplication, they at length forced me to swear to take each of 
  them for a year, to my wedded wife. Now tell me my lords, should I take the 
  old, or the young one first?&quot; We all laughed sufficiently at this riddle, 
  and although some of them muttered one to another thereupon, yet none would 
  undertake to unfold it. Hereupon the fourth began; &quot;In a certain city there 
  dwelt an honourable lady, who was beloved of all, but especially by a young 
  noble man, who would needs be too importunate with her; at length she gave him 
  this determination, that in case he would, in a cold winter, lead her into a 
  fair green garden of roses, then he should obtain, but if not, he must resolve 
  never to see her more. The noble man travelled into all countries to find such 
  a man as might perform this, till at length he lite upon a little old man that 
  promised to do it for him, in case he would assure him of half his estate, which 
  he having consented to the other was as good as his word. Whereupon he invited 
  the aforesaid lady to his garden, where contrary to her expectation, she found 
  all things green, pleasant and warm, and withal remembering her promise, she 
  only requested that she might once more return to her lord, to whom with sighs 
  and tears she bewailed her lamentable condition. But for as much as he sufficiently 
  perceived her faithfulness, he dispatched her back to her lover, who had so 
  dearly purchased her, so that she might give him satisfaction. This husband's 
  integrity did so mightily affect the noble man, that he thought it a sin to 
  touch so honest a wife; so he sent her home again with honour to her lord. Now 
  the little man perceiving such faith in both these, would not, how poor soever 
  he were, be the least, but restored the noble man all his goods again and went 
  his way. Now my lords, I know not which of these persons may have shown the 
  greatest ingenuity?&quot; Here our tongues were quite cut off. Neither would 
  the Virgin make any other reply, but only that another should go on. Wherefore 
  the fifth, without delay, began: &quot;My Lords, I desire not to make long work; 
  who hath the greater joy, he that beholdeth what he loveth, Or he that only 
  thinketh on it?&quot; &quot;He that beholdeth it,&quot; said the Virgin; &quot;Nay&quot; 
  answered I; hereupon arose a contest, wherefore the sixth called out, 'My lords, 
  I am to take a wife; now I have before me a maid, a married wife, and a widow; 
  ease me of this doubt, and I will afterwards help to order the rest.&quot; &quot;It 
  goes well there&quot; replied the seventh, where a man hath his choice, but 
  with me the case is otherwise; in my youth I loved a fair and virtuous virgin 
  from the bottom of my heart, and she me in like manner: howbeit because of her 
  friends denial we could not come together in wedlock. Whereupon she was married 
  to another, yet an honest and discreet person, who maintained her honourably 
  and with affection, until she came into the pains of child-birth, which went 
  so hard with her that all thought she had been dead, so with much state, and 
  great mourning she was interred. Now I thought with my self, during her life 
  thou couldst have no part in this woman, but yet now dead as she is thou mayst 
  embrace and kiss her sufficiently; whereupon I took my servant with me, who 
  dug her up by night. Now having opened the coffin and locked her in my arms, 
  and feeling about her heart, I found still some little motion in it, which increased 
  more and more from my warmth, till at last I perceived that she was indeed still 
  alive; wherefore I quietly bare her home. and after I had warmed her chilled 
  body with a costly bath of herbs, I committed her to my mother until she brought 
  forth a fair son, whom (as the mother) I caused faithfully to be nursed. After 
  two days (she being then in a mighty amazement) I discovered to her all the 
  forepassed affair, requesting her that for the time to come she would live with 
  me as a wife, against which she thus excepted, in case it should be grievous 
  to her husband who had well and honourably maintained her. But if it could otherwise 
  be, she was the present obliged in love to one as well as the other. Now after 
  two months (being then to make a journey elsewhere) I invited her husband as 
  a guest, and amongst other things demanded of him, whether if his deceased wife 
  should come home again, he could be content to receive her, and he affirming 
  it with tears and lamentations, at length I brought him his wife together with 
  his son, and an account of all the forepassed business, intreating him to ratifie 
  with his consent my fore-purposed espousals. After a long dispute he could not 
  beat me from my right, but was fain to leave me the wife. But still the contest 
  was about the son.&quot; Here the Virgin interrupted him, and said, &quot;It 
  makes me wonder how you could double the afflicted mans grief.&quot; &quot;How' 
  answered he, 'was I not then concerned?&quot; Upon this there arose a dispute 
  amongst us, yet the most part affirmed that he had done but right. &quot;Nay,&quot; 
  said he, &quot;I freely returned him both his wife and son. Now tell me my lords, 
  was my honesty, or this man's joy the greater? &quot;These words had so mightily 
  cheered the Virgin that (as if it had been for the sake or these two) she caused 
  a health to go round. After which the rest of the proposals went on somewhat 
  perplexedly, so that I could not retain them all, yet this comes to my mind, 
  that one said, that a few years before he had seen a physician, who bought a 
  parcel of wood against winter, with which he warmed himself all winter long; 
  but as soon as the spring returned he sold the very same wood again, and so 
  had the use of it for nothing. &quot;Here must needs be skill,&quot; said the 
  Virgin, &quot;but the time is now past.&quot; &quot;Yea,&quot; replied my companion, 
  who ever understands not how to resolve all the riddles, may give each man notice 
  of it by a proper messenger, I conceive he will not be denied.&quot; At this 
  time they began to say grace, and we arose altogether from the table, rather 
  satisfied and merry than glutted; and it were to be wished that all invitations 
  and feastings were thus to be kept. Having now taken some few turns up and down 
  the hall again, the Virgin asked us whether we desired to begin the wedding. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said one, noble and virtuous lady; whereupon she privately 
  dispatched a page, and yet in the mean time proceeded in discourse with us. 
  In brief she was already become so familiar with us, that I adventured and requested 
  her Name. The Virgin smiled at my curiosity, but yet was not moved, but replied:</P>
<P>My Name contains five and fifty, and yet hath only eight letters; the third 
  is the third part of the fifth, which added to the sixth will produce a number 
  whose root shall exceed the third itself by just the first, and it is the half 
  of the fourth. Now the fifth and the seventh are equal, the last and the first 
  are also equal, and make with the second as much as the sixth hath, which contains 
  just four more than the third tripled. Now tell me, my lord, how am I called?</P>
<P>The answer was intricate enough to me, yet I left not off so, but said, noble 
  and virtuous lady, may I not obtain one only letter? Yea, said she, that may 
  well be done. What then (replied I again) may the seventh contain? It contains 
  (said she) as many as there are lords here. With this I was content, and easily 
  found her Name, at which she was well pleased, with assurance that much more 
  should yet be revealed to us. Mean time certain virgins had made themselves 
  ready, and came in with great ceremony. First of all two youths carried lights 
  before them; one of them was of jocund countenance, sprightly eyes and gentile 
  proportion. The other looks something angerly, and whatever he would have, must 
  be, as I afterwards perceived. After them first followed four virgins. One looked 
  shame-facedly towards the earth, very humble in behaviour. The second also was 
  a modest, bashful virgin. The third, as she entered the room seemed amazed at 
  somewhat, and as I understood, she cannot well abide where there is too much 
  mirth. The fourth brought with her certain small wreaths, thereby to manifest 
  her kindness and liberality. After these four came two which were somewhat more 
  gloriously apparelled; they saluted us courteously. One of them had a gown of 
  sky colour spangled with golden stars. The others was green, beautified with 
  red and white stripes. On their heads they had thin flying tissaties, which 
  did most becomingly adorn them. At last came one alone, who had on her head 
  a coronet, but rather looked up towards heaven, than towards earth. We all thought 
  it had been the Bride, but were much mistaken, although otherwise in honour, 
  riches and state she much surpassed the Bride; and she afterwards ruled the 
  whole Wedding. Now on this occasion we all followed our Virgin, and fell down 
  on our knees, howbeit she showed her self extreme humble, offering every one 
  her hand, and admonishing us not to be too much surprised at this, for this 
  was one of her smallest bounties, but to lift up our eye to our Creator, and 
  learn hereby to acknowledge his omnipotency, and so proceed in our enterprised 
  course, employing this grace to the praise to God, and the good of man. In sum, 
  her words were quite different from those of our Virgin, who was somewhat more 
  worldly. They pierced even through my bones and marrow. &quot;And thou 'said 
  she further to me, &quot;hast received more than others, see that thou also 
  make a larger return.&quot; This to me was a very strange sermon; for as soon 
  a. we saw the virgins with the music, we imagined we must presently fall to 
  dancing, but that time was not as yet come. Now the weights, whereof mention 
  has been before made, stood still in the same place, wherefore the Queen (I 
  yet knew not who she was) commanded each virgin to take up one, but to our Virgin 
  she gave her own, which was the last and greatest, and commanded us to follow 
  behind. Our majesty was then somewhat abated, for I well observed that our Virgin 
  was but too good for us, and we were not so highly reputed as we our selves 
  wore almost in part willing to fantasy. So we went behind in our order, and 
  were brought into the first chamber, where our Virgin in the first place hung 
  up the Queen's weight, during which an excellent spiritual hymn was sung. There 
  was nothing costly in this room save only curious little prayer books which 
  should never be missing. In the midst was erected a pulpit, very convenient 
  for prayer, where in the Queen kneeled down, and about her we were all fain 
  to kneel and pray after the Virgin, who read out of a book, that this Wedding 
  might tend to the honour of God, and our own benefit. Afterwards we came into 
  the second chamber, where the first Virgin hung up her weight also, and so forward 
  until all the ceremonies were finished. Hereupon the Queen again presented her 
  hand to every one, and departed thence with her virgin. Our president stayed 
  yet a while with us. But because it had been already two hours night, she would 
  no longer detain us; me thought she was glad of our company, yet she bid us 
  good night, and wished us quiet rest, and so departed friendly, although unwillingly 
  from us. Our pages were well instructed in their business, and therefore showed 
  every man his chamber, and stayed also with us in another pallet. that in case 
  we wanted any thing we might make use of them My chamber (of the rest I am not 
  able to speak) was royally furnished with rare tapestries and hung about with 
  paintings. But above all things I delighted in my page, who was so excellently 
  spoken. and experienced in the arts, that he yet spent another hour with me 
  and it was half an hour after three when first I fell asleep. And this indeed 
  was the first night that I slept in quiet, and yet a scurvy dream would not 
  suffer me to rest; for I was all the night troubled with a door which I could 
  not get open. but at last I did it. With these fantasies I passed the time. 
  till at length cowards day I awaked.</P>
<B> 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Fourth Day</FONT></P>
</B> 
<P>I still lay in my bed, and leisurely surveyed the noble images and figures 
  up and down about my chamber, during which on a sudden I heard the music of 
  coronets, as if they had been already in procession. My page skipped out of 
  the bed as if he had been at his wits end, and looked more like one dead than 
  living. In what case I was then, is easily imaginable, for, said he, &quot;The 
  rest are already presented to the King.&quot; I knew not what else to do, but 
  weep out-right and curs s my own slothfulness; yet I dressed my self, but my 
  page was ready long before me, and ran out of the chamber to see how affairs 
  might yet stand. But he soon returned, and brought with him this joyful news, 
  that the time indeed was not yet but only I had over-slept my breakfast, they 
  being unwilling to waken me because of my age. But that now it was time for 
  me to go with him to the fountain where the most part were assembled. With this 
  consolation my spirit returned again, wherefore I was soon ready with my habit, 
  and went after the page to the fountain in the aforementioned garden, where 
  I found that the lion instead of his sword had a pretty large tablet by him. 
  Now having well viewed it, I found that it was taken out of the ancient monuments, 
  and placed here for some especial honour. The inscription was somewhat worn 
  out with age, and therefore I am minded to set it down here. as it is, and give 
  every one leave to consider it.</P>

<P>This writing might well be read and understood, and may therefore fitly be 
  here placed, because easier than any of the rest. Now after we had first washed 
  our selves out of the fountain, and every man had taken a draught out of an 
  entirely golden cup, we were once again to follow the Virgin into the hall, 
  and there put on new apparel, which was all of cloth of gold gloriously set 
  out with flowers. There was also given to every one another Golden Fleece, which 
  was set about with precious stones, and various workmanship according to the 
  utmost skill of each artificer. On it hung a weighty medal of gold, whereon 
  were figured the sun and moon in opposition; but on the other side stood this 
  poesie, The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light 
  of the sun shall be seven times lighter than at present. But our former jewels 
  were rayed in a little casket, and committed to one of the waiters. After this 
  the Virgin lead us out in our order, where the musicians waited ready at the 
  door, all apparelled in red velvet with white guards. After which a door (which 
  I never saw open before) to the Royal winding-stairs was unlocked. There the 
  Virgin led us together with the music, up three hundred and sixty five stairs; 
  there we saw nothing but what was of extreme costly and artificial workmanship; 
  and still the further we went, the more glorious still was the furniture, until 
  at length at the top we came under a painted arch, where the sixty virgins attended 
  us, all richly apparelled. Now as soon as they had bowed to us, and we as well 
  as we could, had returned our reverence, our musicians were dispatched away, 
  who fain to go down the stairs again, the door being shut after them. After 
  this a little bell was tolled; then came in a beautiful Virgin who brought every 
  one a wreath of laurel. But our virgins had branches given them. Mean while 
  a curtain was drawn up, where I saw the King and Queen as they sate there in 
  their majesty, and had not the yesterday queen so faithfully warned me, I should 
  have forgotten my self, and have equalled this unspeakable glory to Heaven.</P>
<P>For besides that the room glistered of mere gold and precious stones; the Queen's 
  robes were moreover so made that I was not able to behold them. And whereas 
  I before esteemed any thing for handsome, here all things so much surpassed 
  the rest, as the stars in heaven are elevated.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Virgin steps in, and so each of the virgins taking one 
  of us by the hand, with most profound reverence presented us to the King, whereupon 
  the Virgin began thus to speak: &quot;That to honour your Royal Majesties (most 
  gracious King and Queen) these lords here present have ventured hither with 
  peril of body and life, your Majesties have reason to rejoice, especially since 
  the greatest part are qualified for the enlarging of your Majesties Estates 
  and Empire, as you will find the same by a most gracious and particular examination 
  of each of them.</P>
<P>Herewith I was desirous to have them in humility presented to your Majesties, 
  with most humble suit to discharge me of this my commission, and most graciously 
  to take sufficient information from each or them, concerning both my actions 
  and omissions.&quot; Hereupon she laid down her branch upon the ground. Now 
  it would have been very fitting for one of us to have put in and spoken somewhat 
  on this occasion, but seeing we were all troubled with the falling of the uvula, 
  at length the old Atlas steps forward and spoke on the King's behalf; &quot;Their 
  Royal Majesties do most graciously rejoice at your arrival, and will that their 
  Royal Grace be assured to all, and every man. And with thy administration, gentle 
  Virgin, they are most graciously satisfied, and accordingly a Royal Reward shall 
  therefore be provided for thee. Yet it is still their intention, that thou shalt 
  this day also continue with them, in as much as they have no reason to mistrust 
  thee.&quot; Hereupon the Virgin humbly took up the branch again. And so we for 
  the first time were to step aside with our Virgin. This room was square on the 
  front, five times broader than it was long; but towards the West it had a great 
  arch like a porch, wherein in circle stood three glorious royal thrones, yet 
  the middle-most was somewhat higher than the rest. Now in each throne sate two 
  persons. In the first sate a very antient King with a grey beard, yet his consort 
  was extraordinarily fair and young. In the third throne sate a black King of 
  middle age, and by him a dainty old matron, not crowned, but covered with a 
  vail. But in the middle sate the two young persons, who tho' they had likewise 
  wreaths of laurel upon their heads, yet over them hung a large and costly crown. 
  Now albeit they were not at this time so fair as I had before imagined to my 
  self, yet so it was to be. Behind them on a round form sat for the most part 
  antient men, yet none of them (at which I wondered) had any sword, or other 
  weapon about him. Neither saw I any other life-guard, but certain Virgins which 
  were with us the day before, who sate on the sides of the arch. Here can I not 
  pass in silence how the little Cupid flew to and again there, but for the most 
  part he hovered and played the wanton about the great crown; sometimes he seated 
  himself between the two lovers, somewhat smiling upon them with his bow. Nay, 
  sometimes he made as if he would shoot one of us. In brief, this knave was so 
  full of his waggery, that he would not spare even the little birds, which in 
  multitudes flew up and down the room, but tormented them all he could.</P>
<P>The virgins had also their pastimes with him, but whensoever they could catch 
  him, it was not so easy a matter for him to get from them again. Thus this little 
  knave made all the sport and mirth. Before the Queen stood a small, but unpressibly 
  curious altar, wherein lay a book covered with black velvet, only a little over-rayed 
  with gold. By this stood a small taper in an ivory candlestick. Now although 
  it were very small, yet it burnt continuously, and stood in that manner, that 
  had not Cupid, in sport, now and then puffed upon it, we could not have conceived 
  it to be fire. By this stood a sphere or celestial globe, which of itself turned 
  clearly about. Next this, a small striking-watch, by that a little christal 
  pipe or siphon-fountain, out of which perpetually ran a clear blood-red liquor; 
  and last of all a skull, or death's head; in this was a white serpent, which 
  was of such a length, that though she crept circle-wise about the rest of it, 
  yet her taile still remained in one of the eye-holes, until her head again entered 
  at the other, so she never stirred from her skull, unless it happened that Cupid 
  twitched a little at her, for then she slips in so suddenly, that we all could 
  not choose but marvel at it. Together with this altar, there were up and down 
  the room wonderful images, which moved themselves, as if they had been alive, 
  and had so strange a contrivance, that it would be impossible for me to relate 
  it all. Likewise, as we were passing out, there began such a marvellous kind 
  of vocal music, that I could not certainly tell, whether it were performed by 
  the virgins who yet stayed behind, or by the images themselves. Now we beeing 
  for this time satisfied, went thence with our virgins, who, the musicians being 
  already present, led us down the winding stairs again, but the door was diligently 
  locked and bolted. As soon as we were come again into the hall, one of the virgins 
  began: &quot;I wonder, Sister, that you dourest adventure your self amongst 
  so many persons.&quot; My Sister,&quot; replied our president, &quot;I am fearful 
  of none so much as of this man,&quot; pointing at me. This speech went to the 
  heart of me, for I well understood that she mocked at my age, and indeed I wan 
  the oldest of them all. Yet she comforted me again with promise, that in case 
  I behaved my self well towards her, she would easily rid me of this burden. 
  Mean time a collation was again brought in, and every one's virgin seated by 
  him, who well knew how to shorten the time with handsome discourses, but what 
  their discourses and sports were I dare not blab out of school. But most of 
  the questions were about the arts, whereby I could lightly gather that both 
  young and old were conversant in the sciences. But still it run in my thoughts 
  how I might become young again, whereupon I wan somewhat the sadder. This the 
  Virgin perceived, and therefore began, &quot;I dare lay anything, if I lye with 
  him to night, he shall be pleasanter in the morning.&quot; Hereupon they began 
  to laugh, and albeit I blushed all over, yet I was fain to laugh too at my own 
  ill-luck. Now there was one there that had a mind to return my disgrace again 
  upon the Virgin, whereupon he said, &quot;I hope not only we, but the virgins 
  too themselves will bear witness in behalf of our brother, that our lady president 
  hath promised her self to be his bedfellow to night.&quot; &quot;I should be 
  well content with it,&quot; replied the Virgin, &quot;if I had no reason to 
  be afraid of these my sisters; there would be no hold with them should I choose 
  the best and handsomest for my self, against their will.&quot; My Sister presently 
  began another, &quot;we find hereby that thy high office makes thee not proud; 
  wherefore if by thy permission we might by lot part the lords here present, 
  amongst us, for bed-fellows, thou shouldst with our good will have such a prerogative.&quot; 
  We let this pass for a jeast, and began again to discourse together. But our 
  Virgin could not leave tormenting us, and therefore began again, &quot;My lords, 
  how if we should permit fortune to decide which of us must lie together to night? 
  &quot;Well,&quot; said I, &quot;if it may be no otherwise, we cannot refuse 
  such a proffer.&quot; Now because it was concluded to make this trial after 
  meat, we resolved to sit no longer at table, so we arose, and each one walked 
  up and down with his virgin. &quot;Nay,&quot; said the Virgin, &quot;it shall 
  not be so yet, but let us see how fortune will couple us,&quot; upon which we 
  were separated asunder. But now first arose a dispute how the business should 
  be carried, but this was only a premeditated device, for the Virgin instantly 
  made the proposal that we should mix our selves together in a ring, and that 
  she beginning to count from her self, the seventh, was to be content with the 
  following seventh, whether it were a virgin, or man. For our parts we were not 
  aware of any craft, and therefore permitted it so to be; but when we thought 
  we had very well mingled our selves, the virgins nevertheless were so subtle, 
  that each one knew her station beforehand. The Virgin began to reckon, the seventh 
  next her was again a virgin, the third seventh a virgin likewise, and this happened 
  so long till (to our amazement) all the virgins came forth, and none of us was 
  hit. Thus we poor pitiful wretches remained standing alone, and were moreover 
  forced to suffer our selves to be jeared too. and confess we were very handsomely 
  couzened. In short, who ever had seen us in our order, might sooner have expected 
  the skye to fall, then that it should never have come to our turn. Herewith 
  our sport was at an end, and we were fain to satisfy our selves with the Virgin's 
  . In the interim, the little wanton Cupid came also in unto us. But because 
  he presented himself on behalf of their Royal Majesties, and delivered us a 
  health (as from them) out of a golden cup, and was to call our virgins to the 
  King, withal declaring he could at this time tarry no longer with them, we could 
  not sufficiently sport our selves with him. So with a due return of our most 
  humble thanks we let him fly forth again. Now because (in the interim) the mirth 
  began to fall into my consort's feet. and the virgins were nothing sorry to 
  see it, they quickly lead up a civil dance, whom I rather beheld with pleasure 
  then assisted, for my mercurialists were so ready with their postures, as if 
  they had been long of the trade. After some few dances our president came in 
  again, and told us how the artists and students had offered themselves to their 
  Royal Majesties, for their honour and pleasure. before their departure to act 
  a merry comedy; and if we thought good to be present at it, and to wait upon 
  their Royal Majesties to the House of the Sun, it would be acceptable to them, 
  and they would most gratiously acknowledge it. Hereupon in the first place we 
  returned our most humble thanks for the honour vouchsafed us; not only so, but 
  moreover most submissively tendered our small service which the Virgin related 
  again, and presently brought word to attend their Royal Majesties (in our order) 
  in the gallery, whither we were soon led, and stayed not long there; for the 
  Royal Procession was just ready, yet without any music at all. The unknown Queen 
  who was yesterday with us, went foremost. with a small and costly coronet, apparelled 
  in white satin, she carried nothing but a small crucifix which was made of a 
  pearl, and this very day wrought between the young King and his Bride. After 
  her went the six fore-mentioned virgins in two ranks, who carried the King's 
  jewels belonging to the little altar. Next to these came the three Kings. The 
  Bridegroom was in the midst of them in a plain dress, only in black satin, after 
  the Italian mode. He had on a small round black hat, with a little black pointed 
  feather, which he courteously put off to us, thereby to signify his favour towards 
  us. To him we bowed our selves, as also to the first, as we had been before 
  instructed. After the Kings came the three Queens, two whereof were richly habited, 
  only she in the middle went likewise all in black, and Cupid held up her train. 
  After this, intimation was given to us to follow, and after us the virgins, 
  till at last old Atlas brought up the rear. In such procession, through many 
  stately walks, we at length came to the House of the Sun, there next to the 
  King and Queen, upon a richly furnished scaffold, to behold the fore-ordained 
  comedy. We indeed, though separated, stood on the right hand of the Kings, but 
  the virgins on the left, except those to whom the Royal Ensigns were committed. 
  To them was allotted a peculiar standing at top of all. But the rest of the 
  attendants were fain to stand below between the columns, and therewith to be 
  content. Now because there are many remarkable passages in this comedy, I will 
  not omit in brief to run it over.</P>
<P>First of all came forth a very ancient King. with some servants, before whose 
  throne was brought a little chest, with mention that it was found upon the water. 
  Now it being opened, there appeared in it a lovely babe, together with certain 
  jewels, and a small letter of parchment sealed and superscribed to the King, 
  which the King therefore presently opened, and having read it, wept, and then 
  declared to his servants how injuriously the King of the Moors had deprived 
  his aunt of her country, and had extinguished all the royal seed even to his 
  infant, with the daughter of which country he had now purposed to have matched 
  his son. Hereupon he swore to maintain perpetual enmity with the Moor and his 
  allies, and to revenge this upon him; and therewith commanded that the child 
  should be tenderly nursed, and to make preparation against the Moor. Now this 
  provision and the discipline of the young lady (who after she was a little grown 
  up was committed to an ancient tutor) continued all the first act, with many 
  very fine and laudable sports besides.</P>
<P>In the interlude a lion and griffon were set at one another, to fight, and 
  the lion got the victory, which was also a pretty sight.</P>
<P>In the second act, the Moor, a very black treacherous fellow, came forth also; 
  who having with vexation understood that his murder was discovered, and that 
  too a little lady was craftily stolen from him, began thereupon to consult how 
  by stratagem he might be able to encounter so powerful an adversary, whereof 
  he was at length advised by certain fugitives who by reason of famine fled to 
  him. So the young lady contrary to all men's expectation, fell again into his 
  hands, whom, had he not been wonderfully deceived by his own servants, he had 
  like to have caused to be slain. Thus this act too was concluded with a marvellous 
  triumph of the Moor.</P>
<P>In the third act a great army on the King's party was raised against the Moor, 
  and put under the conduct of an ancient valiant knight, who fell into the Moors 
  country, till at length he forceably rescued the young lady out of the tower, 
  and apparelled her a new. After this in a trice they erected a glorious scaffold, 
  and placed their young lady upon it. Presently came twelve royal ambassadors, 
  amongst whom the fore-mentioned knight made a speech, alleging that the King 
  his most gracious lord had not only heretofore delivered her from death, and 
  even hitherto caused her to be royally brought up (though she had not behaved 
  her self altogether as became her), but moreover his Royal Majesty had, before 
  others, elected her, to be a spouse for the young lord his son, and most graciously 
  desired that the said espousals might be really executed in case they would 
  be sworn to his Majesty upon the following articles. Hereupon out of a patent 
  he caused certain glorious conditions to be read. which if it were not too long, 
  were well worthy to be here recounted. In brief, the young lady took an oath 
  inviolably to observe the same, returning thanks withal in most seemly sort 
  for this so high a grace. Whereupon they began to sing to the praise of God, 
  of the King, and the young lady, and so for this time departed. For sport, in 
  the mean while, the four beasts of Daniel, as he saw them in the vision, and 
  hath at large described them, were brought in, all which had its certain signification.</P>
<P>In the fourth act the young lady was again restored to her lost kingdom, and 
  crowned, and for a space, in this array, conducted about the place with extraordinary 
  joy. After this many and various ambassadors presented themselves, not only 
  to wish her prosperity, but also to behold her glory. Yet it was not long that 
  she preserved her integrity, but soon began again to look wantonly about her, 
  and to wink at the ambassadors and lords, wherein she truly acted her part to 
  the life.</P>
<P>These her manners were soon known to the Moor, who would by no means neglect 
  such an opportunity, and because her steward had not sufficient regard to her, 
  she was easily blinded with great promises, so that she had no good confidence 
  in her King but privily submitted her self to the entire disposal of the Moor. 
  Hereupon the; Moor made haste, and having (by her consent) gotten her into his 
  hands, he gave her good words so long till all her kingdom had subjected itself 
  to him, after which in the third scene of this act, he caused her to be led 
  forth, and first to be strips stark naked, and then upon a scurvy wooden scaffold 
  to be bound to a post, and well scourged, and at last sentenced to death. This 
  was so woeful a spectacle, that it made the eyes of many to run over. Hereupon 
  thus naked as she was, she was cast into prison, there to expect her death, 
  which was to be procured by poison, which yet killed her not but made her leprous 
  all over. Thus this act was for the most part lamentable.</P>
<P>Between, they brought forth Nebuchadnezzar's image, which was adorn 'd with 
  all manner of arms, on the head, breast, belly, legs and feet, and the like, 
  of which too more shall be spoken in the future explication.</P>
<P>In the fifth act the young King was acquainted with all that had passed between 
  the Moor and his future spouse, who first interceeded with his father for her, 
  intreating that she might not be left in that condition; which his father having 
  agreed to, ambassadors were dispatched to comfort her in her sickness and captivity, 
  but yet withal to give her notice of her inconsiderateness. But she would not 
  yet receive them, but consented to be the Moor's concubine, which was also done, 
  and the young King was acquainted with it.</P>
<P>After this comes a band of fools, each of which brought with him a cudgel, 
  where within a trice they made a great globe of the world, and soon undid it 
  again. It was fine sportive fantasy.</P>
<P>In the sixth act the young King resolved to bid battle to the Moor, which also 
  was done. And albeit the Moor was discomfited, yet all held the young King too 
  for dead. At length he came to himself again, released his spouse, and committed 
  her to his steward and chaplain, the first whereof tormented her mightily; at 
  last the leaf turned over, and the priest was so insolently wicked, that he 
  would needs be above all, until the same was reported to the young King, who 
  hastily dispatched one who broke the neck of the priest's mightiness, and adorned 
  the bride in some measure for the nuptials.</P>
<P>After the act a vast artificial elephant was brought forth. He carries a great 
  tower with musicians, which was also well pleasing to all.</P>
<P>In the last act the bride-groom appeared in such pomp as is not well to be 
  believed, and was amazed how it was brought to pass. The bride met him in the 
  like solemnity, whereupon a11 the people cried out VIVAT SPONSUS, VIVAT SPONSA 
  (11) so that by this comedy they did withal congratulate our King and Queen 
  in the most stately manner, which (as I well observed) pleased them most extraordinarily 
  well.</P>
<P>At length they made some paces about the stage in such procession, till at 
  last they altogether they began thus to sing.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>I</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">This time full of love</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Does our Joy much improve</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Because of the King's nuptial;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And therefore let's sing</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That from all parts it ring,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Blest be he that granted us all.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>II</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The Bride most exquisitely fair,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Whom we attended with long care</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">To him in troth's now plighted:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We fully have at length obtained</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The same for which we did contend:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">He's happy, that's fore-sighted.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>III</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Now the parents kind and good</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">By intreaties are subdu'd:</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Long enough in hold was she mew'd;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">In honour increase,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Till thousands arise</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And spring from your own proper blood.</P>
<P>After this thanks were returned, and the comedy was finished with joy, and 
  the particular good liking of the Royal Persons wherefore (the evening also 
  being already hard by) they departed together in their fore-mentioned order. 
  But we were to attend the Royal Persons up the winding stairs into the forementioned 
  hall, where the tables were already richly furnished, and this was the first 
  time that we were invited to the Kings table. The little altar was placed in 
  the midst of the hall, and the six fore-named royal ensigns were laid upon it. 
  At this time the young King behaved himself very gratiously towards us, but 
  yet he could not be heartily merry. But howbeit he now and then discoursed a 
  little with us, yet he often sighed, at which the little Cupid only mocked, 
  and played his waggish tricks. The old King and Queen were very serious, only 
  the wife of one of the ancient Kings was gay enough, the cause of which I yet 
  understood not. During this, the Royal Persons took up the first table, at the 
  second we only sate. At the third, some of the principal virgins placed themselves. 
  The rest of the virgins, and men, were all fain to wait. This was performed 
  with such state and solemn stillness, that I am afraid to make many words of 
  it. Here I cannot leave untouched how that all the Royal Persons, before meat, 
  attired themselves in snow-white glittering garments, and so sate down to table. 
  Over the table hung the great golden crown, the precious stones whereof, without 
  any other light, would have sufficiently illuminated the hall. However all the 
  lights were kindled at the small taper upon the altar; what the reason was I 
  did not certainly know. But this I took very good notice of, that the young 
  King frequently sent meat to the white serpent upon the little altar, which 
  caused me to muse. Almost all the prattle at this banquet was made by little 
  Cupid, who could not leave us (and me indeed especially) untormented. He was 
  perpetually producing some strange matter. However, there was no considerable 
  mirth, all went silently on, from whence I, by my self, could imagine some great 
  imminent peril. For there was no music at all heard; but if we were demanded 
  any thing, we were fain to give short round answers, and so let it rest. In 
  short, all things had so strange a face, that the sweat began to trickle down 
  all over my body; and I am apt to believe that the stoutheartedst man alive 
  would then have lost his courage. Supper being now almost ended, the young King 
  commanded the book to be reached him from the little altar. This he opened, 
  and caused it once again by an old man to be propounded to us, whether we resolved 
  to abide with him in prosperity and adversity; which we having with trembling 
  consented to, he further caused us sadly to be demanded, whether we would give 
  him our hands on it, which, when we could find no evasion, was fain so to be. 
  Hereupon one after another arose, and with his own hand writ himself down in 
  this book. When thin also was performed, the little crystal fountain, together 
  with a very small crystal glass was brought near, out of which all the Royal 
  Person, one after another drank, Afterwards it was reached to us too, and so 
  forward to all persons, and this was called, the Draught of Silence. Hereupon 
  all the Royal Persons presented us their hands, declaring that in case we did 
  not now stick to them, we should now and never more hereafter see them; which 
  verily made our eyes run over. But our president engaged her self and promised 
  very largely on our behalf, which gave them satisfaction. Mean time a little 
  bell was tolled, at which all the Royal Persons waxed so mighty bleak, that 
  we were ready utterly to despair. They quickly put off their white garments 
  again, and put on entirely black ones. The whole hall likewise was hung about 
  with black velvet, the floor we covered with black velvet, with which also the 
  ceiling above (all this being before prepared) was over-spread. After that the 
  tables were also removed away, had all had seated themselves round about upon 
  the form, and we also had put on black habits. In comes our president again, 
  who was before gone out, and brought with her six black taffeta scarffs, with 
  which she bound the six Royal Persona eyes. Now when they could no longer see, 
  there were immediately brought in by the servants six covered coffins, and set 
  down in the hall also a low black seat placed in the midst. Finally, there steps 
  in a very coal-black tall man, who bare in his hand a sharp axe. Now after that 
  the old King hat been first brought to the seat, his head was instantly whips 
  off, and wrapped up in a black cloth, but the blood was received into a great 
  golden goblet, had placed with him in this coffin that stood by, which being 
  covered was set aside. Thus it went with the rest also, so that I thought it 
  would at length have come to me too, but it did not. For as noon as the six 
  Royal Persons were beheaded, the black man went out again; after whom another 
  followed, who beheaded him too just before the door, and brought back his head 
  together with the axe, which were laid in a little chest. This indeed to me 
  seemed a bloody Wedding, but because I could not tell what would yet be the 
  event, I was fain for that time to captivate my understanding until I were further 
  resolved.</P>
<P>For the Virgin too, seeing that some of us were faint-hearted and wept, bid 
  us be content. For, said she to us, &quot;The life of these standeth now in 
  your hands, and in case you follow me, this death shall make many alive.&quot; 
  Herewith she intimated we should go sleep, and trouble our selves no further 
  on our part, for they should be sure to have their due right. And so she bad 
  us all good night, saying that she must watch the dead corps this night. We 
  did so, and were each of us conducted by our pages into our lodgings. My page 
  talked with me of sundry and various matters (which I still very well remember) 
  and gave me cause enough to admire at his Understanding. But his intention was 
  to lull me asleep, which at last I well observed, whereupon I made as though 
  I was fast asleep, but no sleep came into my eyes, and I could not put the beheaded 
  out of my mind. Now my lodging was directly over against the great lake, no 
  that I could well look upon it, the windows being nigh the bed. About midnight, 
  as soon as it had struck twelve, on a sudden I espied on the lake a great fire, 
  wherefore out of fear I quickly opened the window to nee what would become of 
  it. Then from far I saw seven ships making forward, which were all stuck full 
  of lights. Above on the top of each of them hovered a flame that passed to and 
  fro, and sometimes descended quite down, as that I could lightly Judge that 
  it must needs be the spirits of the beheaded. Now these ships gently approached 
  to land, and each of them had no more than one mariner. As soon as they were 
  now gotten to shore, I presently espied our Virgin with a torch going towards 
  the ship, after whom the six covered coffins, together with the little chest, 
  were carried, and each of them privily laid in a ship. Wherefore I awakened 
  my page too, who hugely thanked me, for having run much up and down all the 
  day, he might quite have overslept this, tho' he well knew it. Now as soon as 
  the coffins were laid in the ships, all the lights were extinguished, and the 
  six flames passed back together over the lake so that there was no more but 
  one light in each ship for a watch. There were also some hundreds of watchmen 
  who had encamped themselves on the shore, and sent the Virgin back again into 
  the castle, who carefully bolted all up again, so that I could well judge that 
  there was nothing more to be done this night, but that we must expect the day, 
  so we again betook ourselves to rest. And I only of all my company had a chamber 
  towards the lake, and saw this, so that now I was also extreme weary, and so 
  fell asleep in my manifold speculations.</P>
<B> 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Fifth Day</FONT></P>
</B> 
<P>The night was over, and the dear wished for day broken, when hastily I got 
  me out of bed, more desirous to learn what might yet ensue, than that I had 
  sufficiently slept. Now after that I had put on my clothes, and according to 
  my custom was gone down the stairs, it was still too early, and I found nobody 
  else in the hall, wherefore I entreated my page to lead me a little about the 
  castle, and show me somewhat that was rare, who was now (as always) willing, 
  and presently lead me down certain steps underground, to a great iron door, 
  on which the following words in great copper letters were fixed:</P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="d5a.gif"></P>
<P>This I thus copied, and set down in my table-book. Now after this door was 
  opened, the page led me by the hand through a very dark passage, till we came 
  again to a very little door, that was now only put too, for (as my page informed 
  me) it was first opened but yesterday when the coffins were taken out, and had 
  not been since shut. Now as soon as we stepped in, I espied the most precious 
  thing that Nature ever created, for this vault had no other light but from certain 
  huge great carbuncles, and this (as I was informed) was the King's Treasury. 
  But the most glorious and principal thing, that I here saw, was a sepulchre 
  (which stood in the middle) so rich that I wondered that it was no better guarded, 
  whereunto the page answered me, that I had good reason to be thankful to my 
  planet, by whose influence it was that I had now seen certain pieces which no 
  humane eye else (except the King's family) had ever had a view of. This sepulchre 
  was triangular, and had in the middle of it a kettle of polished copper, the 
  rest was of pure gold and precious stones. In the kettle stood an angel, who 
  held in his arms an unknown tree, from which it continually dropped fruit into 
  the kettle; and an oft as the fruit fell into the kettle, it turned into water, 
  and ran out from thence into three small golden kettles standing by. This little 
  altar was supported by these three animals, an eagle, an ox and a lion, which 
  stood on an exceeding costly base. I asked my page what this might signify. 
  &quot;Here,&quot; said he, &quot;lies buried Lady Venus, that beauty which hath 
  undone many a great man, both in fortune, honour, blessing and prosperity.&quot; 
  After which he showed me a copper door on the pavement. &quot;Here,&quot; said 
  he, &quot;if you please, we may go further down.&quot; &quot;I still follow 
  you,&quot; replied I. So I went down the steps, where it was exceeding dark, 
  but the page immediately opened a little chest, wherein stood a small ever-burning 
  taper, at which he kindled one of the many torches which lay by. I was mightily 
  terrified, and seriously asked how he durst do this? He gave me for answer, 
  &quot;As long as the Royal Persons are still at rest, I have nothing to fear.&quot; 
  Herewith I espied a rich bed ready made, hung about with-curious curtains, one 
  of which he drew, where I saw the Lady Venus stark-naked (for he heaved up the 
  coverlets too) lying there in such beauty, and a fashion so surprising, that 
  I was almost besides myself, neither do I yet know whether it was a piece thus 
  carved, or a human corpse that lay dead there. For she was altogether immovable, 
  and yet I durst not touch her. So she was again covered, and the curtain drawn 
  before her, yet she was still (as it were) in my eye. But I soon espied behind 
  the bed a tablet on which it was thus written: </P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="day-5.gif"></P>
<P>I asked my page concerning this writing, but he laughed, with promise that 
  I should know it too. So he putting out the torch, we again ascended. Then I 
  better viewed all the little doors, and first found that on every corner there 
  burned a small taper of pyrites, of which I had before taken no notice, for 
  the fire was so clear, that it looked much like a stone than a taper. From this 
  heat the tree was forced continually to melt, yet it still produced new fruit. 
  Now behold (said the page) what I heard revealed to the King by Atlas. When 
  the tree (said he) shall be quite melted down, then shall Lady Venus awake, 
  and be the mother of a King. Whilst he was thus speaking, in flew the little 
  Cupid, who at first was somewhat abashed at our presence, but seeing us both 
  look more like the dead than the living, he could not at length refrain from 
  laughing, demanding what spirit had brought me thither, whom I with trembling 
  answered, that I had lost my way in the castle, and was by chance come hither, 
  and that the page likewise had been looking up and down for me, and at last 
  lighted upon me here, I hoped he would not take it amiss. &quot;Nay then 'tis 
  well enough yet,&quot; said Cupid, &quot;my old busy grandsire, but you might 
  lightly have served me a scurvy trick, had you been aware of this door. Now 
  I must look better to it,&quot; and so he put a strong lock on the copper door, 
  where we before descended. I thanked God that he lighted upon us no sooner. 
  My page too was the more jocund, because I had so well helped him at this pinch.</P>
<P>&quot;Yet can I not,&quot; said Cupid &quot;let it pass unrevenged, that you 
  were so near stumbling upon my dear mother.&quot; With that he put the point 
  of his dart into one of the little tapers, and heating it a little, pricked 
  me with it on the hand, which at that time I little regarded, but was glad that 
  it went so well with us, and that we came off without further danger. Meantime 
  my companions were gotten out of bed too, and were again returned into the hall. 
  To whom I also joined myself, making as if I were then first risen. After Cupid 
  had carefully made all fast again, he came likewise to us, and would needs have 
  me show him my hand, where he still found a little drop of blood, at which he 
  heartily laughed, and bade the rest have a care of me, as I would shortly end 
  my days. We all wondered how Cupid could be so merry, and have no sense at all 
  of the yesterday's sad passages. But he was no what troubled. Now our president 
  had in the mean time made herself ready for the journey, coming in all in black 
  velvet, yet she still bare her branch of laurel. Her virgins too had their branches. 
  Now all things being in readiness, the Virgin bid us first drink somewhat, and 
  then presently prepare for the procession, wherefore we made no long tarrying 
  but followed her out of the hall into the court. In the court stood six coffins, 
  and my companions thought no other but that the six Royal Persons lay in them, 
  but I well observed the device. Yet I knew not what was to be done with these 
  other. By each coffin were eight muffled men. Now as soon as the music went 
  (it was so mournful and dolesome a tune, that I was astonished at it) they took 
  up the coffins, and we (as we were ordered) were fain to go after them into 
  the forementioned garden, in the midst of which was erected a wooden edifice, 
  having round about the roof a glorious crown, and standing upon seven columns; 
  within it were formed six sepulchres, and by each of them a stone, but in the 
  middle it had a round hollow rising stone. In these graves the coffins were 
  quietly and with many ceremonies laid. The stones were shoved over them, and 
  they shut fast. But the little chest was to lie in the middle. Herewith were 
  my companions deceived, for they imagined no other but that the dead corpse 
  were there. Upon the top of all there was a great flag, having a phoenix painted 
  on it, perhaps therewith the more to delude us. Here I had great occasion to 
  thank God that I had seen more than the rest. Now after the funerals were done, 
  the Virgin, having placed her self upon the middle-most stone, made a short 
  oration, that we should be constant to our engagements, and not repine at the 
  pains we were hereafter to undergo, but be helpful in restoring the present 
  buried Royal Persons to life again, and therefore without delay to rise up with 
  her, to make a journey to the tower of Olympus, to fetch from thence medicines 
  useful and necessary for this purpose. This we soon agreed to, and followed 
  her through another little door guise to the shore. There the seven forementioned 
  ships stood all empty, on which all the virgins stuck up their laurel branches, 
  and after they had distributed us in the six ships, they caused us in Gods name 
  thus to begin our voyage, and looked upon us as long as they could have us in 
  sight, after which they with all the watch-men returned into the castle. Our 
  ships had each of them a peculiar device. Five of them indeed had the five regular 
  bodies, each a several one, but mine in which the Virgin too sat, carried a 
  globe. Thus we sailed on in a singular order, and each had only two mariners. 
  Foremost went the ship as in which, as I conceive the Moor lay. In this were 
  twelve musicians, who played excellent well, and its device was a pyramid. Next 
  followed three a breast, b, c, and d, in which we were disposed. I sat in c. 
  In the midst behind these came the two fairest and stateliest ships, e and f, 
  stuck about with many branches of laurel, having no passengers in them; their 
  flags were the sun and moon. But in the rear only one ship g, in this were forty 
  virgins. Now being thus passed over this lake, we first came through a narrow 
  arm, into the right sea, where all the sirens,</P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="d5d.gif"></P>
<P>nymphs, and sea-goddesses had attended us; wherefore they immediately dispatched 
  a sea-nymph to us to deliver their present and offering of honour to the Wedding. 
  It was a costly, great, set, round and orient pearl, the like to which hath 
  not at any time been seen, either in ours, or yet in the new world. Now the 
  Virgin having friendly received it, the nymph further entreated that audience 
  might be given to their divertissements, and to make a little stand, which the 
  Virgin was content to do, and commanded the two great ships to stand into the 
  middle, and with the rest to encompass them in pentagon. After which the nymphs 
  fell into a ring about them, and with a most delicate sweet voice began thus 
  to sing:</P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="penta.gif"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>I</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">There's nothing better here below,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Than beauteous, noble, Love;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Whereby we like to God do grow,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And none to grief do move.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Wherefore let's chant it to the King,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">That all the sea thereof may ring.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We question; answer you.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>II</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">What was it that at first us made?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">'Twas Love.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">And what hath grace a fresh conveigh'd?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">'Tis Love.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Whence was't (pray tell us) we were born?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Of Love</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">How came we then again forlorn?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Sans Love.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>III</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who was it (say) that us conceived?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">'Twas. Love.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">What is it we to our parents owe?</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">What do they us such kindness show?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Of Love.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>IV</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who get's herein the victory?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">'Tis Love.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Can Love by search obtained be?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">By Love.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">How may a man good works perform?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Through Love.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Who into one can two transform?</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">'Tis Love.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>V</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Then let our song sound,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Till it's eccho rebound.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">To Loves honour and praise,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Which may ever increase</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">With our noble Princes, the King,</P>

<P>They having with most admirable consent and melody finished this song, I no 
  more wondered at Ulysses for stopping the ears of his companions, for I seemed 
  to my self the most unhappy man alive, that nature had not made me too so trim 
  a creature. But the Virgin soon dispatched them, and commanded to set sail from 
  thence; wherefore the nymphs too after they had been presented with a long red 
  scarf for a gratuity, went off, and dispersed themselves in the sea. I was at 
  this time sensible that Cupid began to work with me too, which yet tended but 
  very little to my credit, and for as much as my giddiness is likely to be nothing 
  beneficial to the reader, I am resolved to let it rest as it in. But this was 
  the very wound that in the first book I received on the head in a dream. And 
  let every one take warning by me of loitering about Venus's bed, for Cupid can 
  by no means brook it. After some hours, having in friendly discourses made a 
  good way, we came within ken of the Tower of Olympus, wherefore the Virgin commanded 
  by the discharge of some pieces to give the signal of our approach, which was 
  also done. And immediately we espied a great white flag thrust out, and a small 
  gilded pinnace sent forth to meet us. Now as soon as this was come to us, we 
  perceived in it a very ancient man, the warden of the Tower, with certain guards 
  clothed in white, of whom we were friendly received, and so conducted to the 
  Tower. This Tower was situated upon an island exactly square, which was environed 
  with a wall so firm and thick, that I my self counted two hundred and sixty 
  passes over. On the other side of the wall was a fine meadow with certain little 
  gardens, in which grew strange, and to me unknown, fruits; and then again an 
  inner wall about the Tower. The Tower of it self was just as if seven round 
  towers had been built one by another, yet the middlemost was somewhat the higher, 
  and within they all entered one into another, and had seven storeys one above 
  another. Being thus come to the gates of the Tower, we were led a little aside 
  on the wall, that so, as I well observed, the coffins might be brought into 
  the Tower without our taking notice; of this the rest knew nothing. This being 
  done, we conducted into the Tower at the very bottom, which albeit it were excellently 
  painted, yet we had here little recreation, for this was nothing but a laboratory, 
  where we were fain to beat and wash plants, and precious stones, and all sorts 
  of things, and extract their juice and essence, and put up the same in glasses, 
  and deliver them to be laid up. And truly our Virgin was so busy with us, and 
  so full of her directions, that she knew how to give each of us employment enough, 
  so that in this island we were fain to be mere drudges, till we had achieved 
  all that was necessary for the restoring of the beheaded bodies. Meantime (as 
  I afterwards understood) three virgins were in the first apartment washing the 
  corpse with all diligence. Now having at length almost done with this our preparation, 
  nothing more was brought us, but some broth with a little draught of wine, whereby 
  I well observed, that we were not here for our pleasure; for when we had finished 
  our days work too, every one had only a mattress laid on the ground for him, 
  where with we were to content ourselves. For my part I was not very much troubled 
  with sleep, and therefore walked out into the garden, and at length came as 
  far as the wall; and because the heaven was at that time very clear, I could 
  well drive away the time in contemplating the stars. By chance I came to a great 
  pair of stone stairs, which led up to the top of the wall. And because the moon 
  shone very bright, I was so much the more confident, and went up, and looked 
  too a little upon the sea, which was now exceeding calm; and thus having good 
  opportunity to consider better of astronomy, I found that this present night 
  there would happen such a conjunction of the planets, the like to which was 
  not otherwise suddenly to be observed. Now having looked a good little into 
  the sea, and it being just about midnight, as soon as it had struck twelve, 
  I beheld from far the seven flames passing over sea hitherward, and betaking 
  themselves to the top of the spire of the Tower. This made me somewhat afraid 
  for as soon as the flames had settled themselves, the winds arose, and began 
  to make the sea very tempestuous. The moon also was covered with clouds, and 
  my joy ended with such fear, that I had scarce time enough to hit upon the stairs 
  again, and betake my self again to the Tower. Now whether the flames tarried 
  any longer, or passed away again, I cannot say, for in this obscurity I durst 
  no more venture abroad. So I laid me down upon my mattress, and there being 
  besides in the laboratory a pleasant and gently purling fountain, I fell asleep 
  so much the sooner. And thus this fifth day too was concluded with wonders.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Sixth Day</FONT></P>
</B> 
<P>Next morning, after we had awakened one another, we sat together a while to 
  discourse what might yet be the event of things. For some were of opinion what 
  they should all be enlivened again together. Others contradicted it, because 
  the decease of the ancients was not only to restore life, but increase too to 
  the young ones. Some imagined that they were not put to death, but that others 
  were beheaded in their stead. We having now talked together a pretty long while, 
  in comes the old man, and first saluting us, looks about him to see if all things 
  were ready, and the processes enough done. We had herein so behaved ourselves, 
  that he had no fault to find with our diligence, whereupon he placed all the 
  glasses together, and put them into a case. Presently come certain youths bringing 
  with them some ladders, ropes, and large wings, which they laid down before 
  us, and departed. Then the old man began thus: &quot;My dear sons, one of these 
  three things must each of you this day constantly bear about with him. Now it 
  is free for you either to make a choice of one of them, or to cast lots about 
  it.&quot; We replied, we would choose. &quot;Nay, said he, &quot;let it rather 
  go by lot.&quot; Hereupon he made three little schedules. On one he writ Ladder, 
  on the second Rope, on the third Wings. These he laid in a hat, and each man 
  must draw, and whatever he happened upon, that was to be his. Those who got 
  the ropes, imagined themselves to be in the best case, but I chanced on a ladder, 
  which hugely afflicted me, for it was twelve-foot long, and pretty weighty, 
  and I must be forced to carry it, whereas the others could handsomely coil their 
  ropes about them. And as for the wings, the old man joined them so nearly on 
  to the third sort, as if they had grown upon them. Hereupon he turned the cock 
  and then the fountain ran no longer, and we were fain to remove it, from the 
  middle out of the way. After all things were carried off, he taking with him 
  the casket with the glasses, took leave, and locked the door fast after him 
  so that we imagined no other but that we had been imprisoned in this Tower. 
  But it was hardly a quarter of an hour before a round hole at the very top was 
  uncovered, where we saw our Virgin, who called to us, and bad us good morrow, 
  desiring us to come up. They with the wings were instantly above through the 
  hole. Only they with the ropes were in evil plight.</P>
<P>For as soon as ever one of us was up, he was commanded to draw up the ladder 
  to him. At last each mans rope was hanged on an iron hook, so every one was 
  fain to climb up by his rope as well as he could, which indeed was not compassed 
  without blisters. Now as soon as we were all well up, the hole was again covered, 
  and we were friendly received by the Virgin. This room was the whole breadth 
  of the Tower itself having six very stately vestries a little raised above the 
  room, and to be entered by the ascent of three steps. In these vestries we were 
  distributed, there to pray for the life of the King and Queen. Meanwhile the 
  Virgin went in and out of the little door, till we had done. For as soon as 
  our process was absolved, there was brought in, and placed in the middle through 
  the little door, by twelve person (which were formerly our musicians) a wonderful 
  thing of a longish shape, which my companions took only to be a fountain. But 
  I well observed that the corpse lay in it, for the inner chest was of an oval 
  figure, so large that six persons might well lie in it one by another. After 
  which they again went forth, fetched their instruments, and conducted in our 
  Virgin, together with her she attendants, with a most delicate noise of music. 
  The Virgin carried a little casket, but the rest only branches and small lamps, 
  and some too lighted torches. The torches were immediately given into our hands, 
  and we were to stand about the fountain in this order. </P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG BORDER="0" SRC="d6a.gif"></P>
<P>First stood the Virgin A with her attendants in a ring round about with the 
  lamps and branches c. Next stood we with our torches b, then the musicians a 
  in a long rank; last of all the rest of the virgins d in another long rank too. 
  Now whence the virgins came, or whether they dwelt in the castle, or whether 
  they were brought in by night, I know not, for all their faces were covered 
  with delicate white linen, so that I could not know any of them. Hereupon the 
  Virgin opened the casket, in which there was a round thing wrapped up in a piece 
  green double taffeta. This she laid in the uppermost kettle, and then covered 
  it with the lid, which was full of holes, and had besides a rim, on which she 
  poured in some of the water which we had the day before prepared, whence the 
  fountain began immediately to run, and through four small pipes to drive into 
  the little kettle. Beneath the undermost kettle there were many sharp points, 
  on which the virgins stuck their lamps, that so the heat might came to the kettle, 
  and make the water seethe. Now the water beginning to simmer, by many little 
  holes at a, it fell in upon the bodies, and was so hot, that it dissolved them 
  all, and turned them into liquor. But what the above said round wrapped up thing 
  was, my companions knew not, but I understood that it was the Moor's head, from 
  which the water conceived so great heat. At b round about the great kettle, 
  there were again many holes, in which they stuck their branches. Now whether 
  this was done of necessity, or only for ceremony, I know not. However, these 
  branches were continually besprinkled by the fountain, whence it afterwards 
  drops somewhat of a deeper yellow into the kettle. This lasted for near two 
  hours, that the fountain still constantly ran of it self; but yet the longer, 
  the fainter it was. Meantime the musicians went their way, and we walked up 
  and down in the room, and truly the room was so made, that we had opportunity 
  enough to pass away our time. There was, for images, paintings, clock-works, 
  organs, springing fountains, and the like, nothing forgotten. Now it was near 
  the time when the fountain ceased, and would run no longer, upon which the Virgin 
  commanded a round golden globe to be brought. But at the bottom of the fountain 
  there was a tap, by which she let out all the matter that was dissolved by those 
  hot drops (whereof certain quarts were then very red) into the globe. The rest 
  of the water which remained above in the kettle was poured out. And so this 
  fountain (which was now become much lighter) was again carried forth. Now whether 
  it was opened abroad, or whether anything of the bodies that was further useful 
  yet remained, I dare not certainly say. But this I know, that the water that 
  was emptied into the globe was much heavier than six or yet more of us were 
  well able to bear, albeit for its bulk it should have seemed not too heavy for 
  one man. Now this globe being with much ado gotten out of doors, we again sat 
  alone, but I perceiving a trampling overhead, had an eye to my ladder. Hear 
  one might take notice of the strange opinions my companions had concerning this 
  fountain, for they not imagining but that the bodies lay in the garden of the 
  castle, knew not what to make of this kind of working, but I thanked God that 
  I awaked in so opportune a time, and saw that which helped me the better in 
  all the Virgins business. After one quarter of an hour the cover above was again 
  lifted off, and we commanded to come up, which was done as before with wings, 
  ladders and ropes. And it did not a little vex me, that whereas the virgins 
  could go up another way, we were fain to take so much toil; yet I could well 
  judge there must be some special reason in it, and we must leave somewhat for 
  the old man to do too. For even those with the wings had no advantage by them 
  but when they were to mount through the hole. Now being gotten up thither also, 
  and the hole shut again, I saw the globe hanging by a strong chain in the middle 
  of the room. In this room was nothing else but mere windows, and still between 
  two windows there was a door, which was covered with nothing but a great polished 
  looking-glass; and these windows and looking-glasses were so optically opposed 
  one to another, that although the sun (which now shined exceeding bright) beat 
  only upon one door, yet (after the windows towards the sun were opened, and 
  the doors before the looking-glasses drawn aside) in all quarters of the room 
  there was nothing but suns, which by artificial refraction's beat upon the whole 
  golden globe hanging in the midst, and for as much as the same (besides that 
  brightness) was polished, it gave such a lustre, that none of us could open 
  our eyes, but were therefore forced to look out at windows till the globe was 
  well heated, and brought to the desired effect. Here I may well avow that in 
  these mirrors I have seen the most wonderful spectacle that ever Nature brought 
  to light, for there were suns in all places, and the globe in the middle shined 
  yet brighter, so that but for one twinkling of an eye, we could no more endure 
  it than the sun it self. At length the Virgin commanded to shut up the looking-glasses 
  again, and to make fast the windows, and so let the globe cool again a little; 
  and this was done about seven of the clock. Wherefore we thought good, since 
  we might now have leisure a little to refresh our selves with a breakfast. This 
  treatment was again right philosophical, and we had no need to be afraid of 
  intemperance, yet we had no want. And the hope of the future joy (with which 
  the Virgin continually comforted us) made us so jocund that we regarded not 
  any pains, or inconvenience. And this I can truly say too concerning my companions 
  of high quality, that their minds never ran after their kitchen or table, but 
  their pleasure was only to attend upon this adventurous physic, and hence to 
  contemplate the Creator's wisdom and omnipotency. After we had taken our refection, 
  we again settled ourselves to work, for the globe was sufficiently cooled, which 
  with toil and labour we were to lift off the chain and set upon the floor. Now 
  the dispute was how to get the globe in sunder, for we were commanded to divide 
  the same in the midst. The conclusion was that a sharp pointed diamond would 
  best do it. Now when we had thus opened the globe, there was nothing of redness 
  more to be seen, but a lovely great snow-white egg. It most mightily rejoiced 
  us, that this was so well brought to pass. For the Virgin was in perpetual care, 
  least the shell might still be too tender. We stood round about this egg as 
  jocund as if we ourselves had laid it. But the Virgin made it presently be carried 
  forth, and departed herself too from us again, and (as all ways) locked the 
  door to. But what she did abroad with the egg, or whether it were some way privately 
  handled, I know not, neither do I believe it. Yet we were again to pause together 
  for one quarter of an hour, till the third hole were opened, and we by means 
  of our instruments were come upon the fourth stone or floor. In this room we 
  found a great copper kettle filled with yellow sand, which was warmed with a 
  gentle fire. Afterwards the egg was raked up in it, that it might therein come 
  to perfect maturity. This kettle was exactly square; upon one side stood these 
  two verses, writ in great letters.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">O. BLI. TO. BIT. MI. LI.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">KANT. I. VOLT. BIT. TO. GOLT.</P>
<P ALIGN="left">On the second side were these three words.</P>

<P>Now whether the sand or egg were hereby meant, I leave to the learned to dispute, 
  yet do I my part, and omit nothing undeclared. Our egg being now ready was taken 
  out, but it needed no cracking, for the bird that was in it soon freed himself, 
  and showed himself very jocund, yet he looked very bloody and unshapen. We first 
  set him upon the warm sand, so the Virgin commanded that before we gave him 
  any thing to eat, we should be sure to make him fast, otherwise he would give 
  us all work enough. This being done too, food was brought him, which surely 
  was nothing else than the blood of the beheaded, diluted again with prepared 
  water, by which the bird grew so fast under our eyes, that we well saw why the 
  Virgin gave us such warning of him. He bit and scratched so devilishly about 
  him, that could he have had his will upon any of us, he would soon have dispatched 
  him. Now he was wholly black, and wild, wherefore other meat was brought him, 
  perhaps the blood of another of the Royal Persons, whereupon all his black feathers 
  moulted again, and instead of them there grew out snow-white feathers. He was 
  somewhat tamer too, and suffered himself to be more tractable. Nevertheless 
  we did not yet trust him. At the third feeding his feathers began to be so curiously 
  coloured, that in all my life I never saw the like colours for beauty. He was 
  also exceeding tame, and behaved himself so friendly with us, that (the Virgin 
  consenting) we released him from his captivity. &quot;Tis now reason,&quot; 
  began our Virgin, &quot;since by your diligence, and our old man's consent, 
  the bird has attained both his life, and the highest perfection, that he be 
  also joyfully consecrated by us.&quot; Herewith she commanded to bring dinner, 
  and that we should again refresh ourselves, since the most troublesome part 
  of our work was now over, and it was fit we should begin to enjoy our passed 
  labours. We began to make ourselves merry together. Howbeit we had still all 
  our mourning clothes on, which seemed somewhat reproachful to our mirth. Now 
  the Virgin was perpetually inquisitive, perhaps to find to which of us her future 
  purpose might prove serviceable. But her discourse was for the most part about 
  Melting; and it pleased her well when one seemed expert in such compendious 
  manuals as do peculiarly commend an artist. This dinner lasted not above three 
  quarters of an hour, which we yet for the most part spent with our bird, whom 
  we were fain constantly to feed with his meat, but he still continued much at 
  the same growth. After dinner we were not long suffered to digest our meat, 
  but after that the Virgin together with the bird was departed from us. The fifth 
  room was set open to us, whither we got too after the former manner, and tendered 
  our service. In this room a bath was prepared for our bird, which was so coloured 
  with a fine white powder, that it had the appearance of mere milk. Now it was 
  at first cool when the bird was set into it. He was mighty well pleased with 
  it, drinking of it, and pleasantly sporting in it. But after it began to heat 
  by reason of the lamps that were placed under it, we had enough to do to keep 
  him in the bath. We therefore claps a cover on the kettle, and suffered him 
  to thrust his head out through a hole, till he had in this sort lost all his 
  feathers in this bath, and was as smooth as a newborn child, yet the heat did 
  him no further harm, at which I much marvelled, for in this bath the feathers 
  were quite consumed, and the bath was thereby tinged with blue. At length we 
  gave the bird air, who of himself sprung out of the kettle, and was so glitteringly 
  smooth, that it was a pleasure to behold it. But because he was still somewhat 
  wild, we were fain to put a collar, with a chain, about his neck, and so led 
  him up and down the room. Meantime a strong fire was made under the kettle, 
  and the bath sodden away till it all came to a blue stone, which we took out, 
  and having first pounded it, we were afterwards fain to grind it on a stone, 
  and finally with this colour to paint the bird's whole skin over. Now he looks 
  much more strangely, for he was all blue, except the head, which remained white. 
  Herewith our work on this story was performed, and we (after the Virgin with 
  her blue bird was departed from us) were called up through the hole to the sixth 
  storey, where we were mightily troubled, for in the midst a little altar, every 
  way like that in the King's hall above described, was placed. Upon which stood 
  the six fore-mentioned particulars, and he himself (the bird) made the seventh. 
  First of all the little fountain was set before him, out of which he drunk a 
  good draught. Afterwards he pecked upon the white serpent until she bled mightily. 
  This blood we were to receive into a golden cup, and pour it down the bird's 
  throat, who was mighty averse from it. Then we dipped the serpents head in the 
  fountain, upon which she again revived, and crept into her deaths head, so that 
  I saw her no more for a long time after. Meantime the sphere turned constantly 
  on, until it made the desired conjunction. Immediately the watch struck one, 
  upon which there was a going another conjunction. Then the watch struck two. 
  Finally, whilst we were observing the third conjunction, and the same was indicated 
  by the watch, the poor bird of himself submissively laid down his neck upon 
  the book, and willingly suffered his head (by one of us thereto chosen by lot) 
  to be smitten off. Howbeit he yielded not one drop of blood, till he was opened 
  on the breast, and then the blood spun out so fresh and clear as if it had been 
  a fountain of rubies. His death went to the heart of us, and yet we might well 
  judge that a naked bird would stand us in little stead. So we let it rest, and 
  removed the little altar away and assisted the Virgin to burn the body (together 
  with the little tablet hanging by) to ashes with fire kindled at the little 
  taper; afterwards to cleanse the same several times, and to lay them in a box 
  of cypress wood. Here I cannot conceal what a trick I and three more were served. 
  After we had thus diligently taken up the ashes, the Virgin began to speak thus: 
  &quot;My lords, we are here in the sixth room, and have only one more before 
  us, in which our trouble will be at an end, and then we shall return home again 
  to our castle, to awaken our most gracious Lords and Ladies. Now albeit I could 
  heartily wish that all of you, as you are here together, had behaved yourselves 
  in such sort, that I might have given you commendations to our most renowned 
  King and Queen, and you have obtained a suitable reward, yet because, contrary 
  to my desire, I have found amongst you these four (herewith she pointed at me 
  and three more) lazy and sluggish labourers, and yet according to my good-will 
  to all and every one, am not willing to deliver them up to consign punishment; 
  however, that such negligence may not remain wholly unpunished, I am purposed 
  thus concerning them, that they shall only be excluded from the future seventh 
  and most glorious action of all the rest, and so too they shall incur no further 
  blame from their Royal Majesties.&quot; In what a case we now were at this speech 
  I leave others to consider. For the Virgin so well knew how to keep her countenance, 
  that the water soon ran over our basket; and we esteemed ourselves the most 
  unhappy of all men. After this the Virgin by one of her maids (whereof there 
  were many always at hand) caused the musicians to be fetched, who were with 
  cornets to blow us out of doors with such scorn and derision that they themselves 
  could hardly sound for laughing. But it did particularly mightily afflict us 
  that the Virgin so vehemently laughed at our weeping, anger and impatience, 
  and that there might well perhaps be some amongst our companions who were glad 
  of this our misfortune. But it proved otherwise, for as soon as we were come 
  out at the door, the musician bid us be of good cheer and follow them up the 
  winding stairs. They led us up to the seventh floor under the roof, where we 
  found the old man, whom we had not hitherto seen, standing upon a little round 
  furnace. He received us friendly, and heartily congratulated us, that we were 
  hereto chosen by the Virgin; but after he understood the affright we had conceived, 
  his belly was ready to burst with laughing, that we had taken such good fortune 
  so heinously. &quot;Hence,&quot; said he, &quot;my dear sons, learn that man 
  never knoweth how well God intended him.&quot; During this discourse the Virgin 
  also with her little box came running in, who (after she had sufficiently laughed 
  at us) emptied her ashes into another vessel, and filled hers again with other 
  matter, saying she must now go cast a mist before the other artists eyes, that 
  we in the meantime should obey the old lord in whatsoever he commanded us, and 
  not remit our former diligence. Herewith she departed from us into the seventh 
  room whither she called our companions. Now what she first did with them there, 
  I cannot tell, for they were not only most earnestly forbidden to speak of it, 
  but we too by reason of our business, durst not peep on them through the ceiling. 
  But this was our work. We were to moisten the ashes with our fore-prepared water 
  till they became altogether like a very thin dough, after which we set the matter 
  over the fire, till it was well heated. Then we cast it thus hot as it was into 
  two little forms or moulds, and so let it cool a little (here we had leisure 
  to look a while upon our companions through certain crevices made in the floor). 
  They were now very busy at a furnace, and each was himself fain to blow up the 
  fire with a pipe, and they stood thus blowing about it, as if they were herein 
  wondrously preferred before us. And this blowing lasted so long till our old 
  man roused us to our work again, so that I cannot say what was done afterwards. 
  We having opened our little forms, there appeared two beautiful bright and almost 
  transparent little images, the like to which mans eye never saw, a male and 
  a female, each of them only four inches long and that which most mightily surprised 
  me was that they were not hard, but limber and fleshy, as other human bodies, 
  yet had they no life; so that I do most assuredly believe that the Lady Venus's 
  image was also made after some such way. These angelically fair babes we first 
  laid upon two little satin cushonets, and beheld them a good while, till we 
  were almost besotted upon so exquisite an object. The old lord warned us to 
  forbear, and continually to instil the blood of the bird (which had been received 
  into a little golden cup) drop after drop into the mouths of the little images, 
  from whence they apparently to the eye increased; and whereas they were before 
  very small, they were now (according to proportion) much more beautiful, so 
  that worthily all limners ought to have been here, and have been ashamed of 
  their art in respect of these productions of nature. Now they began to grow 
  so big that we lifted them from the little cushonets, and were fain to lay them 
  upon a long table, which was covered with white velvet. The old man also commanded 
  us to cover them over up to the breast with a piece of the fine white double 
  taffeta, which because of their unspeakable beauty, almost went against us. 
  But that I may be brief, before we had in this manner quite spent the blood, 
  they were already in their perfect full growth. They had gold yellow curled 
  hair, and the above mentioned figure of Venus was nothing to them. But there 
  was not yet any natural warmth, or sensibility in them. They were dead figures, 
  yet of a lively and natural colour, and since care was to be taken that they 
  grew not too great, the old man would not permit any thing more to be given 
  them, but quite covered their faces too with the silk, and caused the table 
  to be stuck round about with torches. Here I must warn the reader that he imagine 
  not these lights to have been of necessity, for the old man's intent hereby, 
  was only that we should not observe when the soul entered into them, as indeed 
  we should not have taken notice of it, in case I had not twice before seen the 
  flames. However, I permitted the other three to remain in their belief, neither 
  did the old man know that I had seen anything more. Hereupon he bid us sit down 
  on a bench over against the table. Presently the Virgin came in too with the 
  music and all furniture, and carried two curious white garments, the like to 
  which I had never seen in the castle, neither can I describe them, for I thought 
  no other than that they were mere crystal, but they were gentle, and not transparent, 
  so that I cannot speak of them. These she laid down upon a table, and after 
  she had disposed her virgins upon a bench round about, she and the old man began 
  many legerdemain tricks about the table, which was done only to blind us. This 
  (as I told you) was managed under the roof, which was wonderfully formed, for 
  on the inside it was arched into seven hemispheres, of which the middlemost 
  was somewhat the highest, and had at top a little round hole, which was nevertheless 
  shut, and was observed by none else. After many ceremonies steps in six virgins, 
  each of which bare a large trumpet, which were rouled about with a green glittering 
  and burning material like a wreath, one of which the old man took, and after 
  he had removed some of the lights at top, and uncovered their faces, he placed 
  one of the trumpets upon the mouth of one of the bodies in such manner, that 
  the upper and wider part of it was directed just against the fore-mentioned 
  hole. Here my companions always looked upon the images, but I had other thoughts, 
  for an soon as the foliage or wreath about the shank of the trumpet was kindled, 
  I saw the hole at top open, and a bright stream of fire shooting down the tube, 
  and passing into the body, whereupon the hole was again covered, and the trumpet 
  removed. With this device my companions were deluded, so that they imagined 
  that life came into the image by means of the fire of the foliage, for as soon 
  as he received the soul he twinkled with his eyes, howbeit he scarce stirred. 
  The second time he placed another tube upon its mouth, and kindled it again, 
  and the soul was let down through the tube. This was repeated upon each of them 
  three times, after which all the lights were extinguished and carried away. 
  The velvet carpets of the table were cast together over them, and immediately 
  a travelling bed was unlocked and made ready, into which thus wrapped up they 
  were born, and so after the carpets were taken off them, they were neatly laid 
  by each other, where with the curtains drawn before them, they slept a good 
  while. (Now was it also time for the Virgin to see how our other artists behaved 
  themselves. They were well pleased because, as the Virgin afterwards informed 
  me, they were to work in gold, which is indeed a piece of this art, but not 
  the most principal, most necessary and best. They had indeed too a part of these 
  ashes, so that they imagined no other but that the whole bird was provided for 
  the sake of gold, and that life must thereby be restored to the deceased.) Mean 
  time we sat very still, attending when our married couple would awake. Thus 
  about half an hour was spent. For then the wanton Cupid presented himself again, 
  and after he had saluted us all, flew to them behind the curtain, tormenting 
  them so long till they awaked. This happened to them with very great amazement, 
  for they imagined no other but that they had hitherto slept from the very hour 
  in which they were beheaded. Cupid, after he had awaked them, and renewed their 
  acquaintance one with another, stepped aside a little, and permitted them both 
  somewhat better to recruit themselves, mean time playing his tricks with us, 
  and at length he would needs have the music fetched to be somewhat the merrier. 
  Not long after the Virgin herself comes, and after she had most humbly saluted 
  the young King and Queen (who found themselves somewhat faint) and kissed their 
  hands, she brought them the two forementioned curious garments, which they put 
  on, and so stepped forth. Now there were already prepared two very curious chairs, 
  wherein they placed themselves, and so were by us with most profound reverence 
  congratulated, for which the King in his own person most graciously returned 
  his thanks, and again re-assured us of all grace. It was already about five 
  of clock, wherefore they could make no longer stay, but as noon as ever the 
  chiefest of their furniture could be laden, we were to attend the young Royal 
  Persons down the winding stairs, through all doors and watches unto the ship, 
  in which they embarked themselves, together with certain virgins and Cupid, 
  and sailed so mighty swift that we soon lost sight of them, yet they were met 
  (as I was informed) by certain stately ships. Thus in four hours time they had 
  made many leagues out at sea. After five of clock the musicians were charged 
  to carry all things back again to the ships, and to make themselves ready for 
  the voyage. But because this was somewhat long a doing, the old lord commanded 
  forth a party of his concealed soldiers, who had hitherto been planted in the 
  wall, so that we had taken no notice of any of them, whereby I observed that 
  this Tower was well provided against opposition. Now these soldiers made quick 
  work with our stuff that no more remained further to be done but to go to supper. 
  Now the table being completely furnished, the Virgin brings us again to our 
  companions where we were to carry our selves as if we had truly been in a lamentable 
  condition and forbear Laughing. But they were always smiling one upon another, 
  howbeit some of them too sympathised with us. At this supper the old lord was 
  with us too, who was a most sharp inspector over us, for none could propound 
  any thing so discreetly, but that he knew how either to confute it, or amend 
  it, or at least to give some good document upon it. I learned most by this lord, 
  and it were very good that each one would apply himself to him, and take notice 
  of his procedure, for then things would not so often and so untowardly miscarry. 
  After we had taken our nocturnal reflection, the old lord led us into his closets 
  of rarities, which were here and there dispersed amongst the bulwarks where 
  we saw such wonderful productions of Nature, and other things too which man's 
  wit in imitation of Nature had invented, that we needed a year more sufficiently 
  to survey them. Thus we spent a good part of the night by candlelight. At last, 
  because we were more inclined to sleep than see many rarities we were lodged 
  in rooms in the wall, where we had not only costly good beds but also besides 
  extraordinary handsome chambers, which made us the more wonder why we were the 
  day before forced to undergo so many hardships. In this chamber I had good rest, 
  and being for the most part without care, and weary with continual labour, the 
  gentle rushing of the sea helped me to a sound and sweet sleep, for I continued 
  in one dream from eleven of clock till eight in the morning.</P>
<B> 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">The Seventh Day</FONT></P>
</B> 
<P>After eight of clock I awaked, and quickly made myself ready, being desirous 
  to return again into the Tower, but the dark passages in the wall were so many 
  and various, that I wandred a good while before I could find the way out. The 
  same happened to the rest too, till at last we all met again in the neither 
  most vault, and habits entirely yellow were given us, together with our golden 
  fleeces. At that time the Virgin declared to us that we were Knights of the 
  Golden Stone, of which we were before ignorant. After we had now thus made ourselves 
  ready, and taken our breakfast, the old man presented each of us with a medal 
  of gold; on the one side stood these words,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">AR. NAT. MI. (13)</P>
<P ALIGN="left">On the other these,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">TEM. NA. F. (14)</P>
<P>exhorting us moreover we should enterprise nothing beyond and against this 
  token of remembrance. Herewith we went forth to the sea, where our ships lay 
  so richly equipped, that it was not well possible but such brave things must 
  first have been brought thither. The ships were twelve in number, six of ours, 
  and six of the old lord's, who caused his ships to be freighted with well appointed 
  soldiers. But he betook himself to us into our ship, where we all were together. 
  In the first the musician seated themselves, of which the old lord had also 
  a great number; they sailed before us to shorten the time. Our flags were the 
  twelve celestial signs, and we sat in Libra. Besides other things our ship had 
  also a noble and curious clock, which showed us all the minutes. The sea too 
  was so calm, that it was a singular pleasure to sail. But that which surpassed 
  all the rest, was the old man's discourse, who so well knew how to pass away 
  our time with wonderful histories, that I could have been content to sail with 
  him all my life long. Meantime the ships passed on amain, for before we had 
  sailed two hours the mariner told us that he already knew the whole lake almost 
  covered with ships, by which we could conjecture they were come out to meet 
  us, which also proved true. For as soon as we were gotten out of the sea into 
  the lake by the forementioned river, there presently stood in to us five hundred 
  ships, one of which sparkled with mere gold and precious stones, in which sate 
  the King and Queen, together with other lords, ladies, and virgins of high birth. 
  As soon an they were well in ken of us the pieces were discharged on both sides, 
  and there was such a din of trumpets, shalms, and kettle drums that all the 
  ships upon the sea capered again. Finally, as soon as we came near they brought 
  about our stripe together, and so made a stand. Immediately the old Atlas stepped 
  forth on the King's behalf, asking a short, but handsome oration, wherein he 
  welcomed us, and demanded whether the Royal Presents were in readiness. The 
  rest of my companions were in an huge amazement, whence this. King should arise, 
  for they imagined no other but that they must again awaken him. We suffered 
  them to continue in their wonderment, and carried ourselves as if it seemed 
  strange to us too. After Atlas's oration out steps our old man, making somewhat 
  a larger reply, wherein he wished the King and Queen all happiness and increase, 
  after which he delivered up a curious small casket, but what was in it, I know 
  not, only it we committed to Cupid, who hovered between them both, to keep. 
  After the oration was finished, they again let off a joyful voile of shot, and 
  so we sailed on a good time together, till at length we arrived at another shore. 
  This was near the first gate at which I first entered. At this place again there 
  attended a great multitude of the King's family together with some hundreds 
  of horses. Now as soon as we were come to shore, and disembarked, the King and 
  Queen presented their hands to all of us one with another with singular kindness; 
  and so we were to get up on horseback. Here I desire to have the reader friendly 
  entreated not to interpret the following narration to any vain glory or pride 
  of mine, but to credit me thus far, that if there had not been a special necessity 
  in it, I could very well have utterly concealed this honour which was showed 
  me. We were all one after another distributed amongst the lords. But our old 
  lord, and I most unworthy, were to ride even with the King, each of us bearing 
  a snow white ensign with a red cross. I indeed was made use of because of my 
  age, for we both had long grey beards and hair. I had besides fastened my token 
  round about my hat, of which the young King soon took notice, and demanded if 
  I were he, who could at the gate redeem these tokens? I answered in most humble 
  manner, Yea. But he laughed on me, saying, there henceforth needed no ceremony; 
  I was HIS father. Then he asked me wherewith I had redeemed them? I replied, 
  &quot;With Water and Salt,&quot; whereupon he wondered who had made me so wise; 
  upon which I grew somewhat more confident, and recounted unto him how it had 
  happened to me with my bread, the Dove and the Raven, and he was pleased with 
  it and said expressly that it must needs be, that God had herein vouchsafed 
  me a singular happiness. Herewith we came to the first gate where the Porter 
  with the blue clothes waited, who bore in his hand a supplication. Now as soon 
  as he spied me even with the King, he delivered me the supplication, most humbly 
  beseeching me to mention his ingenuity before the King. Now in the first place 
  I demanded of the King, what the condition of this porter was? who friendly 
  answered me, that he was a very famous and rare astrologer, and always in high 
  regard with the Lord his Father, but having on a time committed a fault against 
  Venus, and beheld her in her bed of rest, this punishment was therefore imposed 
  upon him, that he should so long wait at the first gate, till some one should 
  release him from thence. I replied, &quot;May he then be released?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; 
  said the King, &quot;if any one can be found that hath as highly transgressed 
  as himself, he must stand in his stead, and the other shall be free.&quot; This 
  word went to my heart, for my conscience convinced me that I was the offender, 
  yet I held my peace, and herewith delivered the supplication. As soon as he 
  had read it, he was mightily terrified, so that the Queen who, with our virgins, 
  and that other Queen besides, of whom I made mention at the hanging of the weights, 
  rid just behind us, observed it, and therefore asked him, what this letter might 
  signify. But he had no mind that he should take notice of it, but putting up 
  the paper, began to discourse of other matters, till thus in about three hours 
  time we came quite to the castle, where we alighted, and waited upon the King 
  into his forementioned hall. Immediately the King called for the old Atlas to 
  come to him in a little closet, and showed him the writing, who made no long 
  tarrying, but rid out again to the Porter to take better cognisance of the matter, 
  after which the young King with his spouse, and other lords, ladies and virgins 
  sat down. Then began our Virgin highly to commend the diligence we had used, 
  and the pains and labour we had undergone, requesting we might be royally rewarded, 
  and that she henceforward might be permitted to enjoy the benefit of her commission. 
  Then the old lord stood up too, and attested that all that the Virgin had spoken 
  was true, and that it was but equity that we should both on both parts be contented. 
  Hereupon we were to step out a little, and it was concluded that each man should 
  make some possible wish, and accordingly obtain it, for it was not to be doubted, 
  but that those of understanding would also make the best wish. So we were to 
  consider of it till after supper. Mean time the King and Queen for recreations 
  sake, began to fall to play together. It looked not unlike chess, only it had 
  other laws; for it was the Virtues and Vices one against another, where it might 
  ingeniously be observed with what plots the Vices lay in wait for the Virtues, 
  and how to re-encounter them again. This was so properly and artificially performed, 
  that it were to be wished that we had the like game too. During the game, in 
  comes Atlas again, and asks his report in private, yet I blushed all over, for 
  my conscience gave me no rest; after which the King gave me the supplication 
  to read, and contents whereof were much to this purpose. First he wished the 
  King prosperity, and increase; that his seed might be spread abroad far and 
  wide. Afterwards he remonstrated that the time was now accomplished, wherein 
  according to the royal promise he ought to be released, because Venus was already 
  uncovered by one of his guests, for his observation could not lie to him. And 
  that if his Majesty would please to make a strict and diligent enquiry, he would 
  find that she had been uncovered, and in case this should not prove to be so, 
  he would be content to remain before the gate all the days of his life. Then 
  he sued in the most humble manner, that upon peril of body and life he might 
  be permitted to be present at this nights supper. He was in good hopes to spy 
  out the very offender, and obtain his wished freedom. This was expressly and 
  handsomely indicted, by which I could well perceive his ingenuity, but it was 
  too sharp for me, and I could well have endured never to have seen it. Now I 
  was casting in my mind whether he might perchance be helped through my wish, 
  so I asked the King, whether he might not be released some other way. &quot;No,&quot; 
  replied the King, &quot;because there is a special consideration in the business. 
  However, for this night, we may well gratify him in his desire.&quot; So he 
  sent forth one to fetch him in. Meantime the tables were prepared in a spacious 
  room, in which we had never been before, which was so complete, and in such 
  manner contrived, that it is not possible for me only to begin to describe it. 
  Into this we were conducted with singular pomp and ceremony. Cupid was not at 
  this time present, for (as I was informed) the disgrace which had happened to 
  his mother, had somewhat angered him. In brief, my offence, and the supplication 
  which was delivered were an occasion of much sadness, for the King was in perplexity 
  how to make inquisition amongst his guests, and the more because thus even they 
  too, who were yet ignorant of the matter, would come to the knowledge of it. 
  So he caused the Porter himself, who was already come, to make his strict surveigh, 
  and showed himself as pleasant as he was able. Howbeit at length they began 
  again to be merry, and to bespeak one another with all sorts of recreative and 
  profitable discourses. Now how the treatment and other ceremonies were then 
  performed, it is not necessary to declare, since it is neither the reader's 
  concern, nor serviceable to my design. But all exceeded more in art, and human 
  invention, than that we were overcharged with drinking. And this was the last, 
  and noblest meal at which I was present. After the banquet the tables were suddenly 
  taken away, and certain curious chairs placed round about in a circle, in which 
  we together with the King and Queen, both their old men, the ladies and virgins, 
  were to sit. After which a very handsome page opened the above-mentioned glorious 
  little book, when Atlas immediately placing himself in the midst, began to bespeak 
  us to the ensuing purpose, that his Royal Majesty had not yet committed to oblivion 
  the service we had done him, and how carefully we had attended our duty, and 
  therefore by way of retribution had elected all and each of the Knights of the 
  Golden Stone. That it was therefore further necessary not only once again to 
  oblige ourselves towards his Royal Majesty, but to vow too upon the following 
  articles, and then his Royal Majesty would likewise know how to behave himself 
  towards his liege people. Upon which he caused the page to read over the articles, 
  which were these. </P>
<P>I. You my lords the Knights, shall swear that you shall at no time ascribe 
  your order either unto any devil or spirit, but only to God your Creator, and 
  his hand-maid Nature.</P>
<P>II. That you will abominate all whoredom, incontinency and uncleanness, and 
  not defile your order with such vices.</P>
<P>III. That you through your talents will be ready to assist all that are worthy, 
  and have need of them.</P>
<P>IV. That you desire not to employ this honour to worldly pride and high authority.</P>
<P>V. That you shall not be willing to live longer than God will have you.</P>
<P>At this last article we could not choose but laugh sufficiently, and it may 
  well have been placed after the rest, only for a conceit. Now being to vow to 
  them all by the King's sceptre, we were afterwards with the usual ceremonies 
  installed Knights, and amongst other privileges set over Ignorance, Poverty, 
  and Sickness, to handle them at our pleasure. And this was afterwards ratified 
  in a little chapel (whither we were conducted in all procession) and thanks 
  returned to God for it, where I also at that time to the honour of God hung 
  up my golden fleece and hat, and left them there for an eternal memorial. And 
  because every one was there to write his name, I writ thus;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Summa Scientia nihil Scire,</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Fr. CHRISTIANUS ROSENCREUTZ.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Eques aurei Lapidis.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Anno. 1459. (15)</P>
<P>Others writ likewise, and truly each as seemed him good. After which we were 
  again brought into the hall, where being sate down, we were admonished quickly 
  to bethink ourselves what every one would wish. But the King and his party retired 
  into a little closet, there to give audience to our wishes. Now each man was 
  called in severally, so that I cannot speak of any man's proper wish. I thought 
  nothing could be more praise-worthy than in honour of my order to demonstrate 
  some laudable virtue, and found too that none at present could be more famous, 
  and cost me more trouble than Gratitude. Wherefore not regarding that I might 
  well have wished somewhat more dear and agreeable to my self, I vanquished my 
  self, and concluded, even with my own peril, to free the Porter, my benefactor. 
  Wherefore being now called in, I was first of all demanded whether, having read 
  the supplication, I had observed or suspected nothing concerning the offender, 
  upon which I began undauntedly to relate how all the business had passed. How 
  through ignorance I fell into that mistake, and so offered myself to undergo 
  all that I had thereby demerited. The King, and the rest of the lords wondered 
  mightily at so unhoped for confession, and so wished me to step aside a little. 
  Now as soon as I was called for in again, Atlas declared to me, that although 
  it were grievous to the King's Majesty, that I whom he loved above others, was 
  fallen into such a mischance, yet because it was not possible for him to transgress 
  his ancient usages, he knew not how else to absolve me, but that the other must 
  be at liberty, and I placed in his stead, yet he would hope that some other 
  would be apprehended, that so I might be able to go home again. However, no 
  release was to be hoped for, till the marriage feast of his future son. This 
  sentence had near cost me my life, and I first hated myself and my twatling 
  tongue, in that I could not hold my peace, yet at last I took courage, and because 
  I considered there was no remedy, I related how this Porter had bestowed a token 
  on me, and commended me to the other, by whose assistance I stood upon the scale, 
  and so was made partaker of all the honour and joy already received. And therefore 
  now it was but equal that I should shew my self grateful to my benefactor, and 
  because the same could no way else be done, I returned thanks for the sentence, 
  and was willing gladly to sustain some inconvenience for his sake, who had been 
  helpful to me in coming to so high place. But if by my wish any thing might 
  be effected, I wished my self at home again, and that so he by me, and I by 
  my wish might be at liberty. Answer was made me, that the wishing stretched 
  not so far. However I might well wish him free.</P>
<P>Yet it was very pleasing to his Royal Majesty that I had behaved my self so 
  generously herein, but he was affraid I might still be ignorant into what a 
  miserable condition I had plunged myself through this my curiosity. Hereupon 
  the good man was pronounced free, and I with a sad heart was fain to step aside. 
  After me the rest were called for too, who came jocundly out again, which was 
  still more to my smart, for I imagined no other, but that I must finish my life 
  under the gate. I had also many pensive thoughts running up and down in my head, 
  what I should yet undertake, and wherewith to spend the time. At length I considered 
  that I was now old, and according to the course of nature, had few years more 
  to live. And that this anguish and melancholy life would easily dispatch me, 
  and then my doorkeeping would be at an end, and that by a most happy sleep I 
  might quickly bring myself into the grave. I had sundry of these thoughts. Sometimes 
  it vexed me that I had seen such galant things, and must be robbed of them. 
  Sometimes it rejoiced me that yet before my end I had been accepted to all joy, 
  and should not be forced so shamefully to depart. This was the last and worst 
  shock that I sustained. During these my cogitations the rest were ready. Wherefore 
  after they had received a good night from the King and lords, each one was conducted 
  into his lodging. But I most wretched man had nobody to show me the way, and 
  yet must moreover suffer myself to be tormented, and that I might be certain 
  of my future function, I was fain to put on the ring, which the other had before 
  worn. Finally, the King exhorted me, that since this was now the last time I 
  was like to see him in this manner, I should however behave myself according 
  to my place, and not against the order. Upon which he took me also in his arms, 
  and kissed me, all which I so understood as if in the morning I must sit at 
  my gate. Now after they had all a while spoken friendly to me, and at last presented 
  their hands, committing me to the divine protection, I was by both the old men, 
  the Lord of the Tower. and Atlas, conducted into a glorious lodging, in which 
  stood three beds, and each of us lay in one of them, where we yet spent almost 
  two, &amp;c.</P>
