<p>I. God is Love.</p>  
<p>Man, having the understanding of God, speaks the Word of Power.</p>  
<p>2. Man gives utterance to God.</p>  
<p>3. The Father is Equilibrium.</p>  
<p>The Son is Concentration of the same Spirit. The Spirit is Projection.</p>  
<p><i>The Tri-une Relation</i>--always consists of these Three:</p>  
<p>(I) The Potential--(II) The Ideal--(III) The Concrete.</p>  
<p>(I) The Potential is Life in its most highly abstract mode not yet brought into Form even as Thought. Not particularised in any way.</p>  
<p>(II) The Ideal is the particularising of the Potential into a certain Formulated Thought.</p>  
<p>(III) The Concrete is the Manifestation of the Formulated Thought in Visible Form.</p>  
<p>What everybody wants is to become <i>more alive</i>--as Jesus said, "I am come that they might have Life and might have it more abundantly"--and it is only</p>

<p>on the basis of realising ourselves as a <i>perfect unity throughout</i>, not made up of opposing parts, and that unity <i>Spirit</i>, that we can realise in ourselves the <i>Livingness</i> which <i>Spirit is</i>, and which we <i>as Spirit</i> ought to be.</p>  
<p>HENCE PERFECT DEMONSTRATION.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Truth will always be found to consist of these three, and anything that is contrary to them is contrary to Fundamental Truth.</p>  
<p align="center">WORSHIP</p>  
<p>Worship consists in the recognition of the <i>Personal</i> Nature of Holy Spirit, and in the Continual Alternation (Pulsation) between the two positions of "I am the Person that Thou art," and "Thou art the Person that I am." The Two Personalities are One.</p>  </div>  </BODY>
