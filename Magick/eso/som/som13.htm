<B><P>INSPIRATION</P>
<P>A SONG OF JOY</P>
</B><P>There is a Song upon my lips to-day; it sings of the glad heart and the happy ways of Life.</P>
<P>I will listen to my song, for it carols to me the glad tidings of Great Joy, of Love and Life.</P>
<P>It tells me of the Wondrous Journey of the Soul and the Boundless Life in which my life is hid.</P>
<B><I><P>I am filled with joy.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>BORN OF ETERNAL DAY</P>
</B><P>Child of All Good, you are born of Eternal Day.</P>
<P>There is no evening of the Soul, for it shall live forever.</P>
<P>It is Deathless and Perfect, Complete and One with the Everlasting.</P>
<P>No thought of to-morrow can disturb the calm of him who knows that Life is one Eternal Day.</P>
<P>No fear can enter where Love reigns, and Reason keeps faith with Hope.</P>
<P>The thoughts of the to-morrows and the yesterdays are swallowed up in the great realization of the Perfect Here and the Complete Now.</P>
<B><I><P>To-day I completely accept my wholeness.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>I ARISE AND GO FORTH</P>
</B><P>I arise and go forth into the Dawn of the New Day, filled with faith and assurance in the All Good.</P>
<P>I arise, I arise, I sing with joy!</P>
<P>I proclaim the One Life: "In all and through all."</P>
<P>I arise, I arise, I shout with gladness that is within me.</P>
<P>I declare this day to be Complete, Perfect and Eternal.</P>
<B><I><P>I respond to Life.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>INSPIRATION</P>
</B><P>Come, Thou Great and Infinite Mind and inspire me to do great deeds.</P>
<P>Acquaint me with Thy knowledge and in Thy wisdom make me wise.</P>
<P>I would be taught of Thee, Inner Light, and inspired by Thy presence.</P>
<P>I will listen for Thy Voice and it will tell me of great things to be done.</P>
<P>I will walk in Thy Paths and they will lead me into All Good.</P>
<P>I will be inspired from On High.</P>
<P>O Wonderful Presence, flooding me, filling me with Thy Light,</P>
<P>Thou dost inspire me!</P>
<B><I><P>I feel the inspiration of Spirit.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>THE DAWN HAS COME</P>
</B><P>Out of the darkness of the long night the Dawn has come.</P>
<P>I rise to meet the new day, filled with confidence and strength.</P>
<P>I arise and go forth into the dawn, inspired and refreshed by the Living Spirit within me.</P>
<P>O Day, you shall never die; the sun shall never set upon your perfect glory.</P>
<P>For the Lamp of the Soul has been re-kindled with the oil of Faith,</P>
<P>And Love has cleansed the windows of Life with the spirit of gladness.</P>
<P>They shall nevermore grow dim with fear, for Perfect Love casteth out all fear.</P>
<P>I am renewed in strength through knowing Good.</P>
<B><I><P>My light has come.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>I AM COMPLETE IN THEE</P>
</B><P>Almighty God, Everlasting Good, Eternal Spirit, Maker of all things and Keeper of my Life, Thou art All.</P>
<P>Infinite Presence within, in Whom all live; Joy Supreme, flooding all with gladness, I adore Thee.</P>
<P>Eternal Peace, undisturbed and quiet, I feel Thy calm.</P>
<P>O Thou Who dost inhabit Eternity and dost dwell within all Creation, Who Dost live through all things and in all people, hear Thou my prayer.</P>
<P>I would enter Thy gates with joy and live at peace in Thy House.</P>
<P>I would find a resting place in Thee, and in Thy presence live.</P>
<P>Make me to do Thy will and from Thy wisdom teach me the ways of Truth.</P>
<P>Compel me to follow Thee and let me not pursue the paths of my own counsel.</P>
<P>O Eternal and Blessed Presence, illumine my mind and command my will that my Soul may be refreshed and that my live may be renewed.</P>
<P>As deep cries unto deep, so my thought cries unto Thee and Thou dost answer.</P>
<P>I am renewed and refreshed; my whole being responds to Thy love, and I am complete in Thee.</P>
<P>All my ways are guarded and guided, and I shall live with Thee eternally.</P>
<P>O Lover of my Soul and Keeper of my Spirit, none can separate us, for we are One.</P>
<P>So shall Thy Wisdom guide me, Thy Presence dwell within me, Thy Love keep me and Thy life envelop me now and forevermore.</P>
<B><I><P>I rest in Thee.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>PRESENCE OF THE ALL GOOD</P>
<P>A MARVELOUS SENSE</P>
</B><P>A marvelous sense steals over him who waits on Good, and in patience bides his time.</P>
<P>A feeling of some Unseen Presence silently creeps over the waiting thought, and the Voice of God speaks through the mist and says: "Be not afraid."</P>
<P>It is all for a purpose; and when you cannot trace, you must trust. This is not an illusion, but a reality; for time proves all things, and he who will wait for his time to come shall be rewarded; and Good shall come to him, for God Himself shall be his Companion and Champion.</P>
<B><I><P>I wait on Thee.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>COMPLETE CONFIDENCE</P>
</B><P>My confidence in The All Good is complete.</P>
<P>My faith in the Power of Spirit is supreme.</P>
<P>I have no doubts nor uncertainties.</P>
<P>I know that my Good is at hand, and</P>
<P>I realize that no fear can hinder</P>
<P>That Good from making Its appearance in my life and affairs.</P>
<P>I know that my Life and Good are complete.</P>
<P>Evil cannot touch nor hinder my work.</P>
<P>I rest in security, for</P>
<P>THE ONE MIND IS MY COMPLETE REFUGE AND STRENGTH.</P>
<B><I><P>I am serene and confident.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>DRAWING THE GOOD</P>
</B><P>I draw my Good to me as I travel along the Way of Life, and nothing can keep It from me.</P>
<P>My Good will always follow me.</P>
<P>I accept the Good and rejoice that it is with me.</P>
<B><I><P>I accept the Good.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>I FEAR NO EVIL</P>
</B><P>"I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me."</P>
<P>I will not be afraid, for the All Good is constantly with me and is always near at hand to guide and comfort.</P>
<P>There is no evil in the Truth, and no power of darkness to hinder the Light from shining.</P>
<P>I will not be afraid, for there is One within Who protects and keeps me from all harm.</P>
<B><I><P>I fear no evil.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>I HAVE KNOWN, ALWAYS</P>
</B><P>I have always known the Truth, and no fear can keep my inner knowledge from me.</P>
<P>My wisdom from within comes forth into daily expression.</P>
<P>Knowledge from On High is given to me, and I shall always be led of the Spirit.</P>
<B><I><P>I know the Truth.</P>

<P>I can even now see and hear and feel the All Good in and around me.</P>
<P>It presses itself against me, and fills me with a great surge of Life.</P>
<B><I><P>My Good is at hand.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>MY ATMOSPHERE</P>

<P>There is that within me that calls forth abundance and happiness from Life. I am surrounded with an atmosphere of Peace, Poise and Power.</P>
<P>All who come in contact with that great Calm of my Life are made strong and confident, are healed and blessed.</P>
<P>"Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, bless His Holy Name."</P>

</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>MY OWN SHALL FIND ME</P>
</B><P>My Own shall find me; no matter where I go, It will follow and claim me.</P>
<P>I cannot hide myself from my Own.</P>
<P>My Own shall come to me, even though I deny it; for there is nothing in me that can hinder it from entering and taking possession of my Soul.</P>
