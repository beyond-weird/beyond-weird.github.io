<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Part IV: daily meditations for Self-help and Healing</H1>
<P>In these short meditations I have tried to set forth some ideas which my experiences in mental healing have given me. I have found that a few brief statements, mentally affirmed, followed by a silent meditation, have been most effective in the healing work.</P>
<P>Most of the meditations have been written in the first person in order that those using them may be able to do so just as they are written.</P>
<P>It is not claimed that there is any occult power in these words, but that words similar to these are effective in inducing a greater realization of life. They contain thoughts which I have found to be most helpful.</P>
<P>Try them, my good reader, and see if they will not bring to life a deeper meaning and a greater joy. Whatever brings to the mentality a greater realization of life has, within itself, a healing power. I believe that these meditations will help all who take the time to use them.</P>
<P>First, decide which meditation you wish to use; then become quiet and composed. The body should be relaxed but the mentality should be active. Then, carefully read the meditation several times, phrase by phrase, endeavoring to realize the meaning of the words and trying to enter into the atmosphere of the thought. After having done this, meditate upon the words, following that meditation until you feel a sense of realization.</P>

<B><P>BODILY PERFECTION</P>
<P>COME, AND LET ME HEAL YOU</P>
</B><P>Come to me and I will heal you.</P>
<P>The inner power of Life within me is God, and it can heal anything.</P>
<P>I will to heal and help all who come to me.</P>
<P>I know that the realization of Life and Love within me heals all who come into Its presence.</P>
<P>I love the thought that I silently bless all who enter my atmosphere.</P>
<P>It is not I, but The Father Who dwelleth in me; He doeth the works.</P>
<B><I><P>I heal all who come near me.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>HE IS MIGHTY WITHIN ME TO HEAL</P>
</B><P>God within me is mighty to heal.</P>
<P>He healeth me of all my diseases and cures me of all.</P>
<P>God within is now healing me of all my infirmities, sickness and pain and is bringing comfort to my soul.</P>
<P>God is my life; I cannot be sick.</P>
<P>I hear the voice of Truth telling me to arise and walk, for I am healed.</P>
<B><I><P>I am healed.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>I DO NOT INHERIT DISEASE</P>
</B><P>There is no inherited tendency to disease, nor ill health.</P>
<P>I am born of Pure Spirit and am free from the belief in material existence.</P>
<P>False ideas cannot be transmitted from one to another, and I am free from all race-suggestion.</P>
<P>My Life is from Above, and I remember that I was always Perfect and Complete.</P>
<P>An Inner Light shines forth and frees me from the bonds of all false belief.</P>
<B><I><P>I came from the Spirit.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>NO CONGESTION</P>
</B><P>There is no congestion nor stoppage of action.</P>
<P>Life, flowing through me, is Perfect and Clear;</P>
<P>It cannot be stopped, retarded nor hindered.</P>
<P>I feel the One Life flowing through me now.</P>
<P>It eliminates all impure secretions and washes me clean from all suggestion of false deposits in the flesh.</P>
<P>I am Clean, Pure and Perfect, and my Word eliminates all else.</P>
<B><I><P>There is no congestion.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>NO FALSE GROWTH</P>
</B><P>"Every plant which my Heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up."</P>
<P>There is no false growth and nothing for one to feed on. I am free from all thought of, or belief in, anything false or fearsome.</P>
<P>I cast out all fear and with it all manifestation of Fear.</P>
<P>A false idea is neither person, place nor thing, and has no one to believe in it nor experience it.</P>
<P>I am now One with The Perfect Life of Complete Wholeness.</P>
<B><I><P>My Word casts out all fear.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>NO WEARINESS</P>
</B><P>There is no weariness.</P>
<P>Mind and Spirit do not become tired nor weary, and I am Mind and Spirit.</P>
<P>The flesh cannot become weary, since it has no mind of its own.</P>
<P>I am free from all illusions of weariness.</P>
<P>My whole being responds to the thought of Life.</P>
<P>I am alive with the Great Vitality of the Spirit.</P>

<P>There are no impaired organs.</P>
<P>Every idea of the body is now complete and perfect and functions according to the Divine Law.</P>
<P>I open my ears to hear.</P>

</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>PERFECT VISION</P>
</B><P>There is One Vision and One ability to see, One perfect seeing.</P>
<P>My eyes are open and I see and behold one Perfect Life.</P>
<P>No suggestion of imperfect vision can enter my thought.</P>
<P>I perceive that all people can see, and that the One, looking through all, sees and cannot be limited in vision.</P>
<P>I am one with that complete ability to see, to know and understand the Truth.</P>
<P>I do open my eyes and do see.</P>
<P>Nothing in me can hinder this Word from operating through me and manifesting through my eyes.</P>
<B><I><P>Open my eyes that I may see.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>THE ALL-SEEING EYE</P>
</B><P>The Eye of the Spirit cannot be dimmed, neither can it be impaired in Its ability to see.</P>
<P>My eyes are the Vision of my Indwelling Lord; they are the Windows of my Inner Spirit and are always open to the Vision of Truth.</P>
<P>I see with the Vision of the Spirit, and that ability cannot be weakened nor lost; it is forever effective.</P>
<P>My word which I now speak is the Law of Perfect Sight and my eyes are open and I see.</P>
<B><I><P>Spirit sees through me.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>THE HEALING OF THE FLESH</P>

<P>It is kept perfect through the Law of God.</P>
<P>"In my flesh shall I see God."</P>
<P>The mantle of flesh is perfect and complete here and now.</P>
<P>It is one with the Body of God, and cannot be sick, nor suffer.</P>
<B><I><P>My flesh is perfect.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>THERE IS NO PAIN</P>
</B><P>There is no pain nor inflammation.</P>
<P>All fear is swept away in the realization of Truth.</P>

<P>The Spirit cannot pain, and I am Pure Spirit and cannot be hurt nor harmed.</P>
<B><I><P>I am free from all pain.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>COMPLETENESS</P>
<P>HAPPINESS AND COMPLETION</P>
</B><P>I am happy and complete to-day and forever.</P>

<B><P>NO LOSS</P>
</B><P>There is no loss.</P>
<P>Nothing can be lost, misplaced nor forgotten.</P>
<P>There was never any loss nor confusion.</P>
<P>Creation is Perfect and Complete, and within the One are all things, and are all known to the One.</P>
<P>I am now in complete harmony with the Whole and I cannot lose nor misplace anything.</P>
<P>I am constantly finding more and more Good.</P>
<B><I><P>I know that there is no loss.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>OH, FOR A TONGUE TO EXPRESS</P>
</B><P>Oh, for a tongue to express the Wonders which the Thought reveals!</P>
<P>Oh, for some Word to comprehend the boundless idea!</P>
<P>Would that some Voice were sweet enough to sound the harmony of Life.</P>
<P>But Within, in that vast realm of thought where the Soul meets God, the Spirit knows.</P>
<P>I will listen for that Voice and It will tell me of Life, of Love and Unity.</P>
<B><I><P>Speak to me, Spirit.</P>
</B><P>&amp;middot;</P>
</I><B><P>O SOUL OF MINE, LOOK OUT AND SEE</P>

<P>Look out and see Thy good. It is not afar off, but is at hand.</P>
<P>Prepare Thyself to accept and believe; to know and live.</P>
<P>Let Life enter and live through Thee, Soul of mine, and rejoice that Thou hast vision so fair and so complete.</P>
<P>Rejoice that the Perfect Whole is so completely reflected through Thee.</P>
<B><I><P>My light has come.</P>
</B><P>&amp;middot;</P>
</I><B><P>SEEING THE PERFECT</P>
</B><P>My eyes behold the complete and perfect in all Creation,</P>
<P>"In all, over all and through all."</P>
<P>I see the perfect; there is nothing else to see, and no suggestion of otherness can enter my thought.</P>
<P>I know only the perfect and the complete.</P>

<P>The Changeless is here to stay, and the Timeless cannot cease from Being.</P>
<P>The things that are shall remain, though heaven and earth should pass away.</P>
<P>I rest secure and safe within the Life of Endless Perfection and Completion.</P>

<P>The heart knows of Thee, O Most High within.</P>
<P>It is still in Thy Presence, and it puts its whole confidence in Thee alone.</P>
<B><I><P>In Thy Presence I am still.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>CAST ASIDE ALL DOUBT</P>
</B><P>Cast aside all doubt, O Soul of mine, and be unafraid, for Thy power is from On High.</P>
<P>He Who sitteth in the heavens shall be Thy champion;</P>
<P>Thou need not fear; Come forth, O Spirit, from within and express Thyself through me and let not my doubts hinder Thy approach.</P>
<P>My faith shall go forth to meet Thee, and my confidence shall embrace Thee.</P>
<P>My waiting thought shall bid Thee welcome to my house of Love,</P>
<P>And Joy shall accompany us through the ages yet to come.</P>
<B><I><P>I lay aside all fear and doubt.</P>

<B><P>DIVINE COMPANIONSHIP</P>
</B><P>I have an Inner Friend who walks and talks with me daily.</P>
<P>He is not afar off, but is within me, a constant companion.</P>
<P>I shall never become lonely, for my Friend is always near.</P>

<P>O my kind Friend, how dear to me is Thy presence.</P>
<B><I><P>The Spirit within me is my Friend.</P>
</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>HIS EYE IS ON THE SPARROW</P>

<P>Always He will watch over us and comfort us.</P>
<P>Forever we shall sit in His house and ceaselessly He will care for us.</P>
<P>The All-Seeing Eye cannot overlook any one, and all, all shall be kept in His care.</P>

<B><P>HOPE CANNOT DIE</P>
</B><P>Hope cannot die. Eternal Hope is forever warm and fresh within me; the deathless Hope built upon the rock of sure knowledge.</P>
<P>O Hope Sublime, O Life Supreme, behold I come to Thee as a tired child, and Thou dost rekindle within me the fires of Faith.</P>
<P>Strong, swift and sure, Faith springs forth into action and my entire Being rises to meet the Dawn.</P>

</B></I><P>&amp;middot;</P>
<B><P>I WENT TO THE MOUNTAIN</P>
</B><P>I have discovered a Secret Place within, where the thought goes into a mountain high above the din of the world.</P>

<B><I><P>I am free in Thy Law.</P>
