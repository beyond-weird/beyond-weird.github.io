<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">INTRODUCTION</H1>
<P>The Science of Mind by Ernest Shurtleff Holmes originally copyrighted and published in 1926 has lain dormant in the back room of time.</P>
<P>It is with pleasure that we make this fine publication available again. In so doing, we would like to call attention to the word "God" as used in this book. The author gives definitions in the glossary that help to understand his use of this symbol but it is the consensus of opinion of some of the students of Ernest Holmes' Science of Mind that it might be advisable now to call attention to the fact that this word or symbol has been misused, abused and misunderstood for such a long time that a short explanation here might make the study of this great work more meaningful.</P>
<P>It is with this thought in mind that I would like to clarify what the symbol "God" expresses.</P>
<P>It is, of course, understood that the significance of the principle of infinity expressed in one symbolic word becomes limited by the understanding of the reader. It is because of this fact that too many have suffered through an existence of limitation, confusion, and fear.</P>
<P>We acknowledge that there are truths to be learned from the Bible, and in the first chapter of Genesis verse 26 it says, "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..." To fully understand this statement, it is necessary for us to understand what the word or symbol "God" represents.</P>
<P>When we use the word "God", it should call to mind all that is? all that exists in the invisible world and the visible world since everything that is made is made of infinite spirit.</P>
<P>Since we are made in the image and likeness of Infinite Spirit, we create through the same principle as God, this Infinite Spirit, and under the same Law of cause and effect.</P>
<P>It is necessary that we remember that we live in two worlds at the same time, the invisible world of cause where thoughts and ideas are the creators and the material world of effect where the results or manifestations of our thoughts and ideas come into being.</P>
<P>The Principle or Law of creation is so exact that "...one jot or one title shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled." (<I>Matthew 5:18</I>)</P>
<P>A perfect example of this is a seed planted in the ground growing into a plant. The idea of the plant was invisible in the seed before it was ever planted in the ground and that particular seed will produce only the particular plant which is invisible in the seed. A beautiful lily will not grow from a radish seed.</P>
<P>Both physical scientists and metaphysicians agree that the physical world is in constant change. Since the physical world is the result of invisible ideas, we must come to the conclusion that there is a constant flow of changing ideas in the mind that are ours for the asking.</P>
<P>For too long people have been judging material results according to their own interpretation of the source of that perceived. This has resulted in a belief of the separation of God and man, and has caused untold misery to mankind. We have evolved now to a consciousness that allows us to see that all things are made from one substance Infinite Spirit, which we call God. We must then realize that God and man are one always and that man is given the privilege of expressing God according to his or her (man's) individual understanding.</P>
<P>Many who have spent a good part of their life seeking the truth about who and what man is are in agreement, I believe, that Infinite Spirit, God, or whatever symbol is used to denote the All-Inclusive Intelligent Power running the Universe, has always existed? no beginning and no end? Infinity. The more we learn about the inner or invisible world in which man exists, we realize that this invisible world is infinite and that man who is the image and likeness of the Infinite Intelligent Power is also infinite and has available to him an ever-expanding intelligence.</P>
<P>We accept as true that God is being expressed in many forms, one of which is man. It is only recently within a few thousand years that man has evolved enough to begin to recognize or become self-conscious of man's true potential or identity. Upon the awakening of this self-consciousness, man has made great strides, all-be-it many mistakes along the way. It is my belief that Ernest Holmes had this understanding when he wrote this book and that it was his intention to share this great truth with as many people as possible.</P>
<P>Man needs to be introduced to himself, and a serious study of this Science of Mind text book can be a great help in accomplishing this.</P>
<P>A help for the beginning student is to keep in mind that God must be a Triune since the symbol "God" is used to express everything. God, in order to create must be self-conscious, able to project Himself into an idea, and be able to cause that idea to come forth or become visible through a medium (Himself). Thus, He is the idea, the medium, and the expression or form.</P>
<P>A good example of this kind of triune in action is electricity. Electricity is invisible and yet is able to be used to project itself through a medium and be expressed as light, etc. Yet the electricity is still electricity and still invisible.</P>
<P>Another simple example is the principle of mathematics. The principle is it is invisible, it has always been and is never ending. It can be used through the medium of arithmetic to project the answer of that which is to be expressed. It is always the same and will respond to everyone the same way. Used incorrectly the "power" of either electricity or the principle of mathematics will produce a correct expression or answer according to the correctness of the projection or use of it? although not the expression wanted. The Law governing these principles is so precise that we can be sure that if there has been what we would call an "error" it is not the fault of the electricity or the principle of mathematics.</P>
<P>Man has discovered electricity and mathematics and is able to use the great power of each. Man is now discovering the potential power within himself and beginning to use this great power.</P>
<P>This is the principle of self-conscious life and living. As far as we know at the present time, the only entity being expressed in our physical world that has evolved enough to be able to use this principle of self-conscious life and living is man. Man is a triune (as the image and likeness of God) able through the Law of Creation to project an idea in the mind and have it come into manifestation. All other entities in the known world function at a no-choice level.</P>
<P>For man to be raised up into the Spiritual being for which he was designed, he must take his own unfoldment in hand and give conscious direction to the evolutionary forces within him.</P>
<P>To know the relationship between God and man, makes all the difference in the world to each one of us. To understand the principle of self-conscious life and living allows us to use our God creative powers. This is the birthright of every individual and to bring the understanding of this truth to man is the basic purpose of the Science of Mind teaching.</P>
