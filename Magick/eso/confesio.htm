<B>Confessio Fraternitatis</B> 
<P ALIGN="left">Whatsoever is published, and made known to everyone, concerning 
  our Fraternity, by the foresaid <I>Fama</I>, let no man esteem lightly of it, 
  nor hold it as an idle or invented thing, and much less receive the same, as 
  though it were only a mere conceit of ours.(2) It is the Lord Jehovah (who seeing 
  the Lord's Sabbath is almost at hand, and hastened again, his period or course 
  being finished, to his first beginning) doth turn about the course of Nature; 
  and what heretofore hath been sought with great pains, and daily labour, is 
  now manifested unto those who make small account, or scarcely once think upon 
  it; but those which desire it, it is in a manner forced and thrust upon them, 
  (3) that thereby the life of the godly may be eased of all their toil and labour, 
  and be no more subject to the storms of inconstant Fortune; but the wickedness 
  of the ungodly thereby, with their due and deserved punishment, be augmented 
  and multiplied.</P>
<P>Although we cannot be by any suspected of the least heresy, or of any wicked 
  beginning, or purpose against the worldly government, we do condemn the East 
  and the West (meaning the Pope and Mahomet) blasphemers against our Lord Jesus 
  Christ, and offer and present with a good will to the chief head of the Roman 
  Empire our prayers, secrets, and great treasures of gold.(4)</P>
<P>Yet we have thought good, and fit for the learned's sakes, to add somewhat 
  more to this, and make a better explanation if there be anything too deep, hidden, 
  and set down over dark in the <I>Fama</I>, or for certain reasons were altogether 
  omitted, and left out; (5) hoping herewith the learned will be more addicted 
  unto us, and be made far more fit and willing for our purpose.</P>
<P>Concerning the alteration and amendment of Philosophy, we have (as much as 
  at this present is needful) sufficiently declared, to wit, that the same is 
  altogether weak and faulty; yet we doubt not, (6) although the most part falsely 
  do allege that she (I know not how) is sound and strong, yet notwithstanding 
  she fetches her last breath and is departing.</P>
<P>But as commonly, even in the same place or country where there breaketh forth 
  a new and unaccustomed disease, Nature also there discovereth a medicine against 
  the same; so there doth appear for so manifold infirmities of Philosophy the 
  right means, and unto our Patria sufficiently offered, whereby she may become 
  sound again, which is now to be renewed and altogether new.(7)</P>
<P>No other Philosophy we have, than that which is the head and sum, the foundations 
  and contents of all faculties, sciences, and arts, the which (if we well behold 
  our age) containeth much of Theology and medicine, but little of the wisdom 
  of the law, and doth diligently search both heaven and earth: or, to speak briefly 
  thereof; which doth manifest and declare sufficiently Man, (8) whereof all learned 
  who will make themselves known unto us, and come into our brotherhood, shall 
  find more wonderful secrets by us than heretofore they did attain unto, and 
  did know, or are able to believe or utter.</P>
<P>Wherefore, to declare briefly our meaning hereof, we ought to labour carefully 
  that there be not only a wondering at our meeting and adhortation, but that 
  likewise everyone may know, that although we do not lightly esteem and regard 
  such mysteries and secrets, we nevertheless hold it fit, that the knowledge 
  thereof be manifested and revealed to many. (9)</P>
<P>For it is to be taught and believed, that this our unhoped [for], willing offer 
  will raise many and divers thoughts in men, unto whom (as yet) be unknown <I>Miranda 
  sexta aetatis</I>, or those which by reason of the course of the world, esteem 
  the things to come like unto the present, and are hindered through all manner 
  of importunities of this our time, so that they live no otherwise in the world, 
  than blind fools, who can, in the clear sunshine day discern and know nothing, 
  than only by feeling.</P>
<P>Now concerning the first part, we hold this, that the mediations, knowledge 
  and inventions of our loving Christian Father (10) (of all that, which from 
  the beginning of the world, Man's wisdom, either through God's revelation, or 
  through the service of the angels and spirits, or through the sharpness and 
  depth of understanding, or through long observation, use, and experience, bath 
  found out, invented, brought forth, corrected, and till now bath been propagated 
  and transplanted) are so excellent, worthy and great, that if all books should 
  perish, and by God's almighty sufferance, all writings and all learnings should 
  be lost, yet the posterity will be able only thereby to lay a new foundation, 
  and bring truth to light again; (11) the which perhaps would not be so hard 
  to do as if one should begin to pull down and destroy the old ruinous building, 
  and then to enlarge the fore court, afterwards bring lights in the lodgings, 
  and then change the doors, stair, and other things according to our intention.</P>
<P>But to whom would not this be acceptable, for to be manifested to everyone 
  rather than to have it kept and spared, as an especial ornament for the appointed 
  time to come? (12)</P>
<P>Wherefore should we not with all our hearts rest and remain in the only truth 
  (which men through so many erroneous and crooked ways do seek) if it had only 
  pleased God to lighten unto us the sixth <I>Candelabrium</I>? (13) Were it not 
  good that we needed not to care, not to fear hunger, poverty, sickness and age?</P>
<P>Were it not a precious thing, that you could always live so, as if you had 
  lived from the beginning of the world, and, moreover, as you should still live 
  to the end thereof? Were it not excellent you dwell in one place, that neither 
  the people which dwell beyond the River Ganges in the Indies could hide anything, 
  nor those which live in Peru might be able to keep secret their counsels from 
  thee?</P>
<P>Were it not a precious thing, that you could so read in one only book, and 
  withal by reading understand and remember, all that which in all other books 
  (which heretofore have been, and are now, and hereafter shall come out) hath 
  been, is, and shall he learned and found out of them?</P>
<P>How pleasant were it, that you could so sing, that instead of stony rocks you 
  could draw the pearls and precious stones, (14) instead of wild beasts, spirits, 
  and instead of hellish Pluto, move the mighty princes of the world.</P>
<P>O ye people, God's counsel is far otherwise, (15) who hath concluded now to 
  increase and enlarge the number of our Fraternity, the which we with such joy 
  have undertaken, as we have heretofore obtained this great treasure without 
  our merits, yea without our hopes, and thoughts, and purpose with the like fidelity 
  to put the same in practise, that neither the compassion nor pity of our own 
  children (which some of us in the Fraternity have) shall draw us from it, because 
  we know these unhoped for goods cannot be inherited, nor by chance be obtained.</P>
<P>If there be some body now, which on the other side will complain of our discretion, 
  that we offer our treasures so freely, and without any difference to all men, 
  and do not rather regard and respect more the godly, learned, wise, or princely 
  persons, than the common people; those we do not contradict, (16) seeing it 
  is not a slight and easy matter; but withal we signify so much, that our <I>Arcana 
  </I>or secrets will no ways be common, and generally made known. Although the 
  <I>Fama</I> be set forth in five languages, and is manifested to everyone, yet 
  we do partly very well know that the unlearned and gross wits will not receive 
  nor regard the same; (17) as also the worthiness of those who shall be accepted 
  into our Fraternity are not esteemed and known of us by Man's carefulness, (18) 
  but by the Rule of our Revelation and Manifestation. Wherefore if the unworthy 
  cry and call a thousand times, or if they shall offer and present themselves 
  to us a thousand times, yea God hath commanded our ears, that they should hear 
  none of them: yea God hath so compassed us about with his clouds, that unto 
  us his servants no violence or force can be done or committed; wherefore we 
  neither can be seen or known by anybody, except he had the eyes of an eagle. 
  It hath been necessary that the <I>Fama</I> should be set forth in everyone's 
  mother tongue, because those should not be defrauded of the knowledge thereof, 
  whom (although they be unlearned) God hath not excluded from the happiness of 
  this Fraternity, the which shall be divided and parted into certain degrees; 
  as those which dwell in the city of Damcar (*) in Arabia, who have a far different 
  politick order from the other Arabians. For there do govern only wise and understanding 
  men, who by the king's permission make particular laws; according unto which 
  example also the government shall be instituted in Europe (whereof we have a 
  description set down by our Christianly Father) (19) when first is done and 
  come to pass that which is to precede. And thenceforth our Trumpet shall publicly 
  sound with a loud sound, and great noise, (20) when namely the same (which at 
  this present is shown by few, and is secretly, as a thing to come, declared 
  in figures and pictures) shall be free and publicly proclaimed, and the whole 
  world shall be filled withal. Even in such manner as heretofore, many godly 
  people have secretly and altogether desperately pushed at the Pope's tyranny, 
  which afterwards, with great, earnest, and especial zeal in Germany, was thrown 
  from his seat, and trodden underfoot, whose final fall is delayed, and kept 
  for our times, when he also shall be scratched in pieces with nails, and an 
  end be made of his ass's cry, by a new voice; (21) The which we know is already 
  reasonably manifest and known to many learned men in Germany, as their writings 
  and secret congratulations do sufficiently witness the same.</P>
<P>We could here relate and declare what all the time, from the year of Our Lord 
  1378 (in which year our Christian Father was born) till now, hath happened, 
  where we might rehearse what alterations he hath seen in the world these one 
  hundred and six years of his life, which he hath left to our brethren and us 
  after his decease to peruse. But brevity, which we do observe, will not permit 
  at this present to make rehearsal of it, till a more fit time. (22) At this 
  time it is enough for those which do not despise our declaration, haying therefore 
  briefly touched it, thereby to prepare the way for their acquaintance and friendship 
  with us. (23)</P>
<P>Yet to whom it is permitted that he may see, and for his instruction use, those 
  great letters and characters which the Lord God hath written and imprinted in 
  heaven and earth's edifice, through the alteration of government, which hath 
  been from time to time altered and renewed, (24) the same is already (although 
  as yet unknown to himself) ours. And as we know he will not despise our inviting 
  and calling, so none shall fear any deceit, for we promise and openly say, that 
  no man's uprightness and hopes shall deceive him, whosoever shall make himself 
  known unto us under the seal of secrecy, and desire our Fraternity.</P>
<P>But to the false hypocrites, and to those that seek other things than wisdom, 
  we say and witness by these presents publicly, we cannot be made known, and 
  be betrayed unto them; and much less they shall be able to hurt as any manner 
  of way without the will of God; (25) but they shall certainly be partakers of 
  all the punishment spoken of in our <I>Fama</I>; so their wicked counsels shall 
  light upon themselves, and our treasures shall remain untouched and unstirred, 
  until the Lion doth come, who will ask them for his use, (26) and employ them 
  for the confirmation and establishment of his kingdom. We ought therefore here 
  to observe well, and make it known unto everyone, that God hath certainly and 
  most assuredly concluded to send and grant to the world before her end, which 
  presently thereupon shall ensue, such a truth, light, life and glory, as the 
  first man Adam had, which he lost in Paradise, after which his successors were 
  put and driven, with him, to misery wherefore there shall cease all servitude, 
  falsehood, lies, and darkness, which by little and little, with the great world's 
  revolution, was crept into all arts, works, and governments of men, and have 
  darkened the most part of them. For from thence are proceeded an innumerable 
  sort of all manner of false opinions and heresies, that scarce the wisest of 
  all was able to know whose doctrine and opinion he should follow and embrace, 
  and could not well and easily be discerned; seeing on the one part they were 
  detained, hindered, and brought into errors through the respect of the philosophers 
  and learned men, and on the other part through true experience. (27) All the 
  which, when it shall once be abolished and removed, and instead thereof a right 
  and true rule instituted, (28) then there will remain thanks unto them which 
  have taken pains therein. But the work itself shall be attributed to the blessedness 
  of our age.</P>
<P>As we now willingly confess, that many principal men by their writings will 
  be a great furtherance unto this Reformation which is to come; so we desire 
  not to have this honour ascribed to us, as if such work were only commanded 
  and imposed upon us. But we confess, and witness openly with the Lord Jesus 
  Christ, that it shall first happen that the stones shall arise, and offer their 
  service, before there shall be any want of executors and accomplishers of God's 
  counsel; yea, the Lord God hath already sent before certain messengers, which 
  should testify his will, to wit, some new Stars, which do appear and are seen 
  in the firmament in <I>Serpentano</I> and <I>Cygno</I>, which signify and give 
  themselves known to everyone, that they are powerful <I>Signacula</I> of great 
  weighty matters.&quot; So then, the secret hid writings and characters are most 
  necessary for all such things which are found out by men. (29) Although that 
  great book of nature stands open to all men, yet there are but few that can 
  read and understand the same. For as there is given to man two instruments to 
  hear, likewise two to see, and two to smell, but only one to speak, and it were 
  but vain to expect speech from the ears, or hearing from the eyes. So there 
  hath been ages or times which have seen, there have also been ages that have 
  heard, smelt, and tasted. Now there remains yet that which in short time, (30) 
  honour shall be likewise given to the tongue, and by the same; what before times 
  hath been seen, heard, and smelt, now finally shall be spoken and uttered forth, 
  when the World shall awake out of her heavy and drowsy sleep, (31) and with 
  an open heart, bare-head, and bare-foot, shall merrily and joyfully meet the 
  new arising Sun.</P>
<P>These characters and letters, as God hath here and there incorporated them 
  in the Holy Scriptures, the Bible, so hath he imprinted them most apparently 
  into the wonderful creation of heaven and earth, yea in all beasts. So that 
  like as the mathematician and astronomer can long before see and know the eclipses 
  which are to come, so we may verily foreknow and foresee the darkness of obscurations 
  of the church, and how long they shall last. From the which characters or letters 
  we have borrowed our magic writing, and have found out, and made, a new language 
  for ourselves, in the which withall is expressed and declared the nature of 
  all things. So that it is no wonder that we are not so eloquent in other languages, 
  (32) the which we know that they are altogether disagreeing to the language 
  of our forefathers, Adam and Enoch, and were through the Babylonical confusion 
  wholly hidden.</P>
<P>But we must also let you understand that there are yet some Eagles' Feathers 
  in our way, the which do hinder our purpose. Wherefore we do admonish everyone 
  for to read diligently and continually the Holy Bible, for he that taketh all 
  his pleasures therein, he shall know that he prepared for himself an excellent 
  way to come to our Fraternity. For as this is the whole sum and content of our 
  rule, that every letter or character which is in the world ought to be learned 
  and regarded well; so those are like unto us, and are very near allied unto 
  us, who do make the Holy Bible a rule of their life, and an aim and end of all 
  their studies: yea to let it be a compendium and content of the whole world. 
  And not only to have it continually in the mouth, but to know how to apply and 
  direct the true understanding of into all times and ages of the world. Also, 
  it is not our custom to prostitute and make so common the Holy Scriptures; (33) 
  for there are innumerable expounders of the same; some alleging and wresting 
  it to serve for their opinion, some to scandal it, and most wickedly do liken 
  it to a nose of wax, which alike should serve the divines, philosophers, physicians, 
  and mathematicians, against all the which we do openly witness and acknowledge, 
  that from the beginning of the world there hath not been given 'Into men a more 
  worthy, a more excellent, and more admirable and wholesome Book than the Holy 
  Bible. Blessed is he that hath the same, yet more blessed is he who reads it 
  diligently, but most blessed of all is he that truly understand eth the same, 
  for he is most like to God, and doth come most near to him. (34) But whatsoever 
  hath been said in the <I>Fama</I> concerning the deceivers against the transmutation 
  of metals, (35) and the highest medicine in the world, the same is thus to be 
  understood, that this so great gift of God we do in no manner set at naught, 
  or despise it. But because she bringeth not with her always the knowledge of 
  Nature, but this bringeth forth not only medicine, but also maketh manifest 
  and open unto us innumerable secrets and wonders. Therefore it is requisite, 
  that we be earnest to attain to the understanding and knowledge of philosophy. 
  And moreover, excellent wits ought not to be drawn to the tincture of metals, 
  before they be exercised well in the knowledge of Nature. He must needs be an 
  insatiable creature, who is come so far, that neither poverty nor sickness can 
  hurt him, yea, who is exalted above all other men, and hath rule over that, 
  the which doth anguish, trouble and pain others, yet will give himself again 
  to idle things, as to build houses, make wars, and use all manner of pride, 
  because he hath gold and silver infinite store.</P>
<P>God is far otherwise pleased, for he exalteth the lowly, and pulleth down the 
  proud with disdain; to those which are of few words, he sendeth his holy Angel 
  to speak with them, but the unclean babblers he driveth in the wilderness and 
  solitary places. The which is the right reward of the Romish seducers, (36) 
  who have vomited forth their blasphemies against Christ, and as yet do not abstain 
  from their lies in this clear shining light. In Germany all their abominations 
  and detestable tricks have been disclosed, (37) that thereby he may fully fulfil 
  the measure of sin, and draw near to the end of his punishment. Therefore one 
  day it will come to pass, that the mouth of those vipers will be stopped and 
  the three double horn will be brought to nought, (38) as thereof at our meeting 
  shall more plain and at large be discoursed.</P>
<P>For conclusion of our Confession, we must earnestly admonish you, that you 
  put away, if not all, yet the most books written by false Alchemists, who do 
  think it but a jest, or a pastime, when they either misuse the Holy Trinity, 
  when they do apply it to vain things, or deceive the people with most strange 
  figures, and dark sentences and speeches, and cozen the simple of their money; 
  as there are nowadays too many such books set forth, (39) which the Enemy of 
  man's welfare doth daily, and will to the end, mingle among the good seed, thereby 
  to make the Truth more difficult to be believed, which in herself is simple, 
  easy, and naked, but contrarily Falsehood is proud, haughty, and coloured with 
  a kind of lustre of seeming godly and of humane wisdom. Ye that are wise eschew 
  such books, and turn unto us, who seek not your moneys, but offer unto you most 
  willingly our great treasures. We hunt not after your goods with invented lying 
  tinctures, but desire to make you partakers of our goods. We speak unto you 
  by parables, (40) but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy and 
  ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets. 
  We desire not to be received of you, but invite you unto our more than kingly 
  houses and palaces, and that verily not by our own proper motion, but (that 
  you likewise may know it) as forced unto it, by the instigation of the Spirit 
  of God, by his admonitions, and by the occasion of this present time. (41) </P>
<P>What think you, loving people, and how seem you affected, seeing that you now 
  understand and know, that we acknowledge ourselves truly and sincerely to profess 
  Christ, condemn the Pope, addict ourselves to the true Philosophy, lead a Christian 
  life, (42) and daily call, entreat and invite many more unto our Fraternity, 
  unto whom the same Light of God likewise appeareth? Consider you not at length 
  how you might begin with us, not only by pondering the Gifts which are in you, 
  and by experience which you have in the word of God, beside the careful consideration 
  of the imperfection of all arts, and many other unfitting things, to seek for 
  an amendment therein; to appease God, and to accommodate you for the time wherein 
  you live. (43) Certainly if you will perform the same, this profit will follow, 
  that all those goods which Nature hath in all parts of the world wonderfully 
  dispersed, shall at one time altogether be given unto you, and shall easily 
  disburden you of all that which obscureth the understanding of man, and hindereth 
  the working thereof, like unto the vain eccentrics and epicycles. (44)</P>
<P>But those pragmatical and busy-headed men, (45) who either are blinded with 
  the glittering of gold, or (to say more truly) who are now honest, but by thinking 
  such great riches should never fail, might easily be corrupted, (46) and brought 
  to idleness, and to riotous proud living, those we desire that they would not 
  trouble us with their idle and vain crying. (47) But let them think, that although 
  there be a medicine to be had which. might fully cure all diseases, nevertheless 
  those whom God hath destined to plague with diseases, and to keep under the 
  rod of correction, such shall never obtain any such medicine.</P>
<P>Even in such manner, although we might enrich the whole world, and endue them 
  with learning, and might release it from innumerable miseries, yet shall we 
  never be manifested and made known unto any man, without the especial pleasure 
  of God; yea, it shall be so far from him whosoever thinks to get the benefit 
  and be partaker of our riches and knowledge, without and against the will of 
  God, that he shall sooner lose his life in seeking and searching for us, than 
  to find us, and attain to come to the wished happiness of the Fraternity of 
  the Rosy Cross.</P>

<P>(1) The Latin text is divided into fourteen chapters. The Latin Title runs 
  &quot;Confessio R.C. ad Eruditos Europae.&quot;</P>
<P>(2) Latin: &quot;Whatsoever you have heard, Mortals through the blast of the 
  Fama R.C. concerning our Fraternity, you should not attribute to chance, or 
  suspect to be our design.&quot;</P>
<P>(3) Latin: &quot;And what heretofore hath been sought in vain with great pains 
  and unwearied labour, He now manifests to those who never thought upon such 
  things, nay, offers to the violent and forces upon the unwilling.&quot;</P>
<P>(4) Latin: &quot;Although our institution, through which we execute the will 
  of our excellent Father, we think has been sufficiently declared unto you in 
  the Fama; nor can we be suspected of any heresy, etc.&quot;</P>
<P>(5) Latin: &quot;or for certain reasons were not to be expressed in the other 
  languages.&quot; The reference is to the five languages in which the Fama was 
  said to be published.&quot;</P>
<P>(6) Latin: &quot;Yea, we doubt not&#133;&quot;</P>
<P>(7) Latin: &quot;The only right means and those such as are suitable to our 
  Patria, whereby she may become sound again and appear anew, or rather renewed, 
  for the renovation of the earth.&quot;</P>
<P>(8) Latin: &quot;Man alone, the Microcosm; concerning whom the more modest 
  of the Learned, if any there be, who will appear at our fraternal invitation, 
  shall find, etc.&quot;</P>
<P>(9) Latin: &quot;To labour carefully that there be no cause for wonder at our 
  adhortation, and that all may agree that such great secrets are not profaned 
  by us, but that it is fitting that the rumour of them shall be spread among 
  many. For it is not absurd that many should be overwhelmed by a conflict of 
  opinion at this unhoped-for opportunity of ours.&quot;</P>
<P>(10) Frankfort, 1617, here reads &quot;Our beloved father Christian.&quot;</P>
<P>(11) &quot;and to build up again a new Castle or Fortress of Truth.&quot;</P>
<P>(12) Latin: &quot;How therefore can such things be despised by us; as if they 
  were given for us only to know and not rather for the adornment of the age?&quot;</P>
<P>(13) Latin: &quot;If God had been pleased to light the Sixth Candelabrum for 
  us alone? Were it not sufficient for us, that we needed not to fear hunger, 
  etc.&quot; Throughout this passage the sense has been obscured both in the German 
  and English (by the failure to give to the Latin &quot;Nobis&quot; its force. 
  The argument is: we ought so to labour that none may wonder at our summons or 
  think we profane secrets. How pleasant would it be for us, the Fratres R.C., 
  alone; but oh Mortals, far otherwise is God's design and your opportunity.&quot; 
</P>
<P>(14) &quot;You could draw to yourself pearls and precious stones.&quot;</P>
<P>(15) Latin: &quot;Far otherwise, O Mortals, is God's Counsel and your opportunity.&quot;</P>
<P>(16) Latin: We are not angry with such persons, for the charge is not without 
  weight.&quot;</P>
<P>(17) Latin: &quot;Our Secrets will not be made public, however much in five 
  languages they echo around the ears of the vulgar.&quot;</P>
<P>(18) Latin: &quot;esteemed by us according to the extent of their curiosity.&quot;</P>
<P>(*) Damascus.</P>
<P>(19) &quot;Shall be instituted by us in Europe.&quot;</P>
<P>(20) Latin: &quot;and with no ambiguities of language.&quot;</P>
<P>(21) Frankfort, 1617, reads &quot;by the new voice of a roaring Lion.&quot;</P>
<P>(22) &quot;A more fitting opportunity may occur and then it shall be done.&quot;</P>
<P>(23) &quot;a closer union and friendship with us.&quot;</P>
<P>(24) &quot;and which He hath renewed for us throughout all changes of Governments.&quot;</P>
<P>(25) &quot;We cannot be betrayed to our hurt nor even can we be constrained, 
  unless God will it.&quot;</P>
<P>(26) Latin: &quot;ask for them in his own right for himself.&quot;</P>
<P>(27) Latin: &quot;while they were drawn to one side by the Fame of Philosophers 
  and to the other by the truths of experience.&quot; This seems to be a direct 
  reference to the <I>Fama</I>.</P>
<P>(28) Latin: &quot;and instead thereof, as we trust will happen.&quot;</P>
<P>(29) Latin: &quot;Powerful signacula of the Great Design, which can teach how 
  God makes these, together with the discoveries of human minds, serve the purpose 
  of His hidden scriptures.&quot; The new star in Cygnus appeared in 1602, that 
  in Serpentarius in 1604; On the 'new stars' see Johannes Kepler, <I>De Stella 
  Nova in pede Serpentarii</I>, with a supplement <I>De Stella incognita Cygni,</I> 
  Prague, 1606. Since the new stars appeared in 1604, the reference to them here 
  again emphasizes the date 1604 as significant. This is the year in which Rosencruetz's 
  tomb is supposed to have been discovered.</P>
<P>(30) &quot;with time shortened and drawing to its end.&quot;</P>
<P>(31) &quot;shall have slept out the drunkenness of the cup of poison and slumber.&quot;</P>
<P>(32) Latin: &quot;that we are less delicate in other languages and in this 
  Latin.&quot;</P>
<P>(33) &quot;And so to accustom themselves, that they do not have it continually 
  in the mouths on all unnecessary occasions, but that they may know how to apply, 
  etc.; because it is not our custom to prostitute the Holy Scriptures.&quot; 
</P>
<P>(34) Latin: &quot;Blessed is he who hath it, more blessed he who reads it, 
  most blessed is he who learns it, but he who understands and observes it, is 
  most like unto God.&quot;</P>
<P>(35) &quot;hath been said by us, in our abhorance of Impostors, against the 
  Transmutation of Metals.&quot; That is, against false alchemists.</P>
<P>(36) Latin: &quot;Of the Roman Impostor, who hath, etc.&quot;</P>
<P>(37) &quot;this clear shining light by which in Germany all his caverns and 
  subterranean mazes have been disclosed.&quot;</P>
<P>(38) &quot;And his triple crown shall be brought to naught.&quot; Cassel, 1616, 
  alone reads &quot;triple horn.&quot; </P>
<P>(39) The Latin adds: &quot;and among them the Amphitheatral Comedian hath a 
  foremost place, a man right ingenious in imposition; and such doth the Enemy, 
  etc.&quot;</P>
<P>(40) &quot;We speak unto you not by Parables.&quot;</P>
<P>(41) Latin: &quot;but driven by the Spirit of God, commanded by the Testament 
  of our excellent Father and compelled by the Law of our time.&quot;</P>
<P>(42) Latin: &quot;lead a life worthy of a man.&quot;</P>
<P>(43) Latin: &quot;you might after all meditate on the remedy together with 
  us, stretch out your hand to the work of God and serve the Empire of your time?&quot;</P>
<P>(44) Latin: &quot;shall be brought to you united and collected as in the center 
  of the sun and moon. Then you could expel from world all that obscures human 
  knowledge and retards action, even as all the eccentrics and epicycles.&quot;</P>
<P>(45) Latin: &quot;But you, who are determined at least to satisfy your curiosity.&quot;</P>
<P>(46) &quot;now honest but by the unexpected opportunity of obtaining such riches 
  might be corrupted.&quot;</P>
<P>(47) Latin: &quot;do not disturb our sacred silence with your clamour.&quot;</P>
<P>(48) Latin: &quot;he shall sooner lose his life in searching for us than attain 
  felicity by finding us. The Fraternity of the R.C.&quot;</P>
