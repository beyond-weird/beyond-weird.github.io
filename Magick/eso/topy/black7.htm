<BR>
Because Sigils exploit thee power ov sexual release and ov dream states and thee 
unconscious, we believe it essential that all Individuals make an effort to increase 
their awareness in these areas. One way to do this is to keep a private diary 
in which to record, in as much detail as possible, all dreams and sexual activity. 
Thee focus ov attention brought about by doing this will inevitably increase one's 
sensitivity and Psychick strength, which in turn will strengthen one's Sigils. 
We also recommend that you keep for yourself a record ov all Sigils, and ov anything 
you feel happened as a result, or is in some way connected. Again, include as 
much detail as you can, such as your objective, your feelings and observations, 
thee quality ov orgasm, fantasies employed etc., and anything else that seems 
relevant to thee work (no matter how seemingly co-incidental) that caught your 
attention.<BR>
