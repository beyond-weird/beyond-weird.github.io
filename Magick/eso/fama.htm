<P>Seeing the only wise and merciful God in these latter days hath poured out 
  so richly his mercy and goodness to mankind, where by we do attain more and 
  more to the perfect knowledge of his Son Jesus Christ and Nature, that justly 
  we may boast of the happy time, wherein there is not only discovered unto us 
  the half part of the world, which was heretofore unknown and hidden, but he 
  hath also made manifest unto us many wonderful, and never heretofore seen, works 
  and creatures of Nature, and moreover hath raised men, imbued with great wisdom, 
  who might partly renew and reduce all arts (in this our age spotted and imperfect) 
  to perfection; so that finally man might thereby understand his own nobleness 
  and worth, and why he is called <I>Microcosmus</I>,<SUP>(1) </SUP>and how far 
  his knowledge extendeth into Nature. </P>
<P>Although the rude world herewith will he but little pleased, but rather smile 
  and scoff thereat; also the pride and covetousness of the learned is so great, 
  it will not suffer them to agree together; but were they united, they might 
  out of all those things which in this our age God doth so richly bestow upon 
  us, collect <I>Librum Naturae</I>, or a perfect method of all arts: but such 
  is their opposition, that they still keep, and are loth to leave the old course, 
  esteeming <I>Porphyry</I>,<SUP>(2) </SUP><I>Aristotle</I>, and <I>Galen</I>, 
  yea and that which bath but a mere show of learning, more than the clear and 
  manifested light and truth; who if they were now living, with much joy would 
  leave their erroneous doctrines. But here is too great weakness for such a great 
  work. And although in theology, physics, and the mathematics, the truth doth 
  oppose itself<SUP>(3)</SUP> nevertheless the old enemy by his subtlety and craft 
  doth show himself in hindering every good purpose by his instruments and contentious 
  wavering people. To such an intent of a general reformation, the most godly 
  and highly illuminated father, our brother, C.R. a German, the chief and original 
  of our Fraternity, hath much and long time laboured, who by reason of his poverty 
  (although descended of noble parents) in the fifth year of his age was placed 
  in a cloister, where he had learned indifferently the Greek and Latin tongues, 
  who (upon his earnest desire and request) being yet in his growing years, was 
  associated to a brother, P.A.L. who had determined to go to the Holy Land.</P>
<P>Although this brother died in Ciprus,<SUP>(4)</SUP> and so never came to Jerusalem, 
  yet our brother C.R. did not return, but shipped himself over, and went to Damasco,<SUP>(5)</SUP> 
  minding from thence to go to Jerusalem; but by reason of the feebleness of his 
  body he remained still there, and by his skill in physic he obtained much favour 
  with the Turks. In the meantime he became by chance acquainted with the wise 
  men of Damasco in Arabia, and beheld what great wonders they wrought, and how 
  Nature was discovered unto them; hereby was that high and noble spirit of brother 
  C.R. so stirred up, that Jerusalem was not so much now in his mind as Damasco; 
  also he could not bridle his desires any longer, but made a bargain with the 
  Arabians, that they should carry him for a certain sum of money to Damasco; 
  he was but of the age of sixteen years when he came thither, yet of a strong 
  Dutch constitution. There the wise received him (as he himself witnesseth) not 
  as a stranger, but as one whom they had long expected; they called him by his 
  name, and showed him other secrets out of his cloister, whereat he could not 
  but mightily wonder. He learned there better the Arabian tongue, so that the 
  year following he translated the book M. into good Latin, which he afterwards 
  brought with him. This is the place where he did learn his physicks, and his 
  mathematicks, whereof the world hath just cause to rejoice, if there were more 
  love, and less envy. After three years he returned again with good consent, 
  shipped himself over <I>Sinus Arabicus</I> into Egypt, where he remained not 
  long, but only took better notice there of the plants and creatures. He sailed 
  over the whole Mediterranean sea for to come unto Fez, where the Arabians had 
  directed him. And it is a great shame unto us, that wise men, so far remote 
  the one from the other, should not only be of one opinion, hating all contentious 
  writings, but also be so willing and ready under the seal of secrecy to impart 
  their secrets to others.</P>
<P>Every year the Arabians and Africans do send one to another, inquiring one 
  of another out of their arts, if happily they had found out some better things, 
  or if experience had weakened their reasons. Yearly there came something to 
  light, whereby the mathematica, physic, and magic (for in those are they of 
  Fez most skilful) were amended. As there is nowadays in Germany no want of learned 
  men, <I>magicians, cabalists, physicians</I>, and <I>philosophers</I>, were 
  there but more love and kindness among them, or that the most part of them would 
  not keep their secrets close only to themselves. At Fez he did get acquaintance 
  with those which are commonly called the Elementary Inhabitants, who revealed 
  unto him many of their secrets. As we Germans likewise might gather together 
  many things, if there were the like unity, and desire of searching out secrets 
  amongst us.</P>
<P>Of these of Fez he often did confess that their <I>Magia </I>was not altogether 
  pure, and also that their <I>Cabala </I>was defiled with their religion; but 
  notwithstanding he knew how to make good use of the same, and found still more 
  better grounds for his faith, altogether agreeable with the harmony of the whole 
  world, and wonderfully impressed in all periods of times. And thence proceedeth 
  that fair concord, that, as in every several kernel is contained a whole good 
  tree or fruit, so likewise is included in the little body of man the whole great 
  world, whose religion, policy, health, members, nature, language, words and 
  works, are agreeing, sympathizing, and in equal tune and melody with God, heaven, 
  and earth. And that which is dis-agreeing with them is error, falsehood, and 
  of the Devil, who alone is the first, middle, and last cause of strife, blindness, 
  and darkness in the world. Also, might one examine all and several persons upon 
  the earth, he should find that which is good and right, is always agreeing with 
  itself; but all the rest is spotted with a thousand erroneous conceits.</P>
<P>After two years brother C.R. departed the city of Fez, and sailed with many 
  costly things into Spain, hoping well [that since] he himself had so well and 
  so profitably spent his time in his travel, that the learned in Europe would 
  highly rejoice with him, and begin to rule and order all their studies according 
  to those sound and sure foundations. He therefore conferred with the learned 
  in Spain, showing unto them the errors of our arts, and how they might be corrected, 
  and from whence they should gather the true <I>Indicia</I> of the times to come, 
  and wherein they ought to agree with those things that are past; also how the 
  faults of the Church and the whole <I>Philosophia Moralis</I> was to be amended. 
  He showed them new growths, new fruits, and beasts, which did concord with old 
  philosophy, and prescribed them new <I>Axiomata</I>, whereby all things might 
  fully be restored. But it was to them a laughing matter; and being a new thing 
  unto them, they feared that their great name should be lessened, if they should 
  now again begin to learn and acknowledge their many years errors, to which they 
  were accustomed, and wherewith with they had gained them enough. Who-so loveth 
  unquietness, let him be reformed.</P>
<P>The same song was also sung to him by other nations, the which moved him the 
  more because it happened to him contrary to his expectations, being ready then 
  bountifully to impart all his arts and secrets to the learned, if they would 
  have but undertaken to write the true and infallible <I>Axiomata</I>, out of 
  all faculties, sciences, and arts, and whole Nature, as that which he knew would 
  direct them, like a globe or circle, to the only middle point and <I>Centrum</I>, 
  and (as is usual among the Arabians) it should only serve to the wise and learned 
  as a rule. That also there might be a Society in Europe, which might have gold, 
  silver, and precious stones, sufficient for to bestow them on kings, for their 
  necessary uses and lawful purposes; with which such as be governors might be 
  brought up, for to learn all that which God hath suffered man to know, and thereby 
  to he enabled in all times of need to give their counsel unto those that seek 
  it, like the heathen oracles. Verily we must confess that the world in those 
  days was already big with those great commotions, labouring to be delivered 
  of them; and did bring forth painful, worthy men, who broke with all force through 
  darkness and barbarism, and left us who succeeded to follow them: and assuredly 
  they have been the uppermost point in <I>trigono igneo</I>, whose flame now 
  should be more and more bright, and shall undoubtedly give to the world the 
  last light.</P>
<P>Such a one likewise hath Theophrastus been in vocation and callings, although 
  he was none of our Fraternity, yet nevertheless hath he diligently read over 
  the book M: whereby his sharp <I>ingenium</I> was exalted; but this man was 
  also hindered in his course by the multitude of the learned and wise-seeming 
  men, that he was never able peacefully to confer with others of his knowledge 
  and understanding he had of Nature. And therefore in his writing he rather mocked 
  these busy bodies, and doth not show them altogether what he was: yet nevertheless 
  there is found with him well grounded the aforenamed <I>Harmonia</I>, which 
  without doubt he had imparted to the learned, if he had not found them rather 
  worthy of subtle vexation, than to be instructed in greater arts and sciences; 
  he then with a free and careless life lost his time, and left unto the world 
  their foolish pleasures.</P>
<P>But that we do not forget our loving father, brother C.R., he after many painful 
  travels, and his fruitless true instructions, returned again into Germany, the 
  which he (by reason of the alterations which were shortly to come, and of the 
  strange and dangerous contentions) heartily loved. There, although he could 
  have bragged with his art, but specially of the transmutations of metals, yet 
  did he esteem more Heaven, and the citizens thereof, Man, than all vain glory 
  and pomp.</P>
<P>Nevertheless he built a fitting and neat habitation, in which he ruminated 
  his voyage, and philosophy, and reduced them together in a true memorial. In 
  this house he spent a great time in the mathematicks, and made many fine instruments, 
  <I>ex omnibus hajus artis partibus</I>, whereof there is but little remaining 
  to us, as hereafter you shall understand. After five years came again into his 
  mind the wished for reformation; and in regard he doubted of the aid and help 
  of others, although he himself was painful, lusty, and unwearying, he undertook, 
  with some few joined with him, to attempt the same. Wherefore he desired to 
  this end, to have out of his first cloister (to the which he bare a great affection) 
  three of his brethren, brother G.V., brother J.A., and brother J.O., who besides 
  that, they had some more knowledge in the arts, than in that time many others 
  had, he did bind those three unto himself, to be faithful, diligent, and secret; 
  as also to commit carefully to writing, all that which he should direct and 
  instruct them in, to the end that those which were to come, and through especial 
  revelation should be received into this Fraternity, might not be deceived of 
  the least syllable and word.</P>
<P>After this manner began the Fraternity of the <I>Rose Cross</I>; first, by 
  four persons only, and by them was made the magical language and writing, with 
  a large dictionary, which we yet daily use to God's praise and glory, and do 
  find great wisdom therein; they made also the first part of the book M. But 
  in respect that that labour was too heavy, and the unspeakable concourse of 
  the sick hindered them, and also whilst his new building (called <I>Sancti spiritus</I>) 
  was now finished, they concluded to draw and receive yet others more into their 
  Fraternity; to this end was chosen brother R.C., his deceased father's brother's 
  son, brother B. a skilful painter, G. and P.D. their secretary, all Germans 
  except J.A. so in all they were eight in number, all bachelors and of vowed 
  virginity; by those was collected a book or volume of all that which man can 
  desire, wish, or hope for.</P>
<P>Although we do now freely confess, that the world is much amended within an 
  hundred years, yet we are assured that our <I>Axiomata</I> shall unmovably remain 
  unto the world's end, and also the world in her highest and last age shall not 
  attain to see anything else; for our <I>Rota</I> takes her beginning from that 
  day when God spake <I>Fiat</I>, and shall end when he shall speak <I>Pereat</I>; 
  yet God's clock striketh every minute, where ours scarce striketh perfect hours. 
  We also steadfastly believe, that if our brethren and fathers had lived in this 
  our present and clear light, they would more roughly have handled the Pope, 
  Mahomet, scribes, artists, and sophisters, and had showed themselves more helpful, 
  not simply with sighs, and wishing of their end and consummation.</P>
<P>When now these eight brethren had disposed and ordered all things in such manner, 
  as there was not now need of any great labour, and also that everyone was sufficiently 
  instructed, and able perfectly to discourse of secret and manifest philosophy, 
  they would not remain any longer together, but as in the beginning they had 
  agreed, they separated themselves into several countries, because that not only 
  their <I>Axiomata</I> might in secret be more profoundly examined by the learned, 
  but that they themselves, if in some country or other they observed anything, 
  or perceived some error, they might inform one another of it.</P>
<P>Their agreement was this: First, That none of them should profess any other 
  thing than to cure the sick, and that <I>gratis</I>. 2. None of the posterity 
  should be constrained to wear one certain kind of habit, but therein to follow 
  the custom of the country. 3. That every year upon the day C. they should meet 
  together in the house <I>S. Spiritus</I>, or write the cause of his absence. 
  4. Every brother should look about for a worthy person, who, after his decease, 
  might succeed him. 5. The word C.R. should be their seal, mark, and character. 
  6. The Fraternity should remain secret one hundred years. These six articles 
  they bound themselves one to another to keep, and five of the brethren departed, 
  only the brethren B. and D. remained with the father, Fra. R. C., a whole year; 
  when these likewise departed. Then remained by him his cousin and brother J.O. 
  so that he hath all the days of his life with him two of his brethren. And although 
  that as yet the Church was not cleansed, nevertheless we know that they did 
  think of her, and what with longing desire they looked for. Every year they 
  assembled together with joy, and made a full resolution of that which they had 
  done; there must certainly have been great pleasure, to hear truly and without 
  invention related and rehearsed all the wonders which God had poured out here 
  and there through the world. Everyone may hold it out for certain, that such 
  persons as were sent, and joined together by God, and the heavens, and chosen 
  out of the wisest of men, as have lived in many ages, did live together above 
  all others in highest unity, greatest secrecy, and most kindness one towards 
  another.</P>
<P>After such a most laudable sort they did spend their lives, and although they 
  were free from all diseases and pain, yet notwithstanding they could not live 
  and pass their time appointed of God. The first of this Fraternity which died, 
  and that in England, was J.O., as brother C. long before had foretold him; he 
  was very expert, and well learned in <I>Cabala</I>, as his book called H. witnesseth. 
  In England he is much spoken of; and chiefly because he cured a young Earl of 
  Norfolk of the leprosy. They had concluded, that as much as possibly could be, 
  their burial place should be kept secret, as at this day it is not known unto 
  us what is become of some of them, yet everyone's place was supplied with a 
  fit successor. But this we will confess publicly by these presents to the honour 
  of God, that what secrets soever we have learned out of the book M. (although 
  before our eyes we behold the image and pattern of all the world) yet are there 
  not shown unto us our misfortunes, nor hour of death, the which only is known 
  to God himself, who thereby would have us keep in a continual readiness. But 
  hereof more in our Confession, where we do set down 37 reasons wherefore we 
  now do make known our Fraternity, and proffer such high mysteries, and without 
  constraint and reward. Also we do promise more gold than both the Indies bring 
  to the King of Spain; for Europe is with child and will bring forth a strong 
  child, who shall stand in need of a great godfather's gift.</P>
<P>After the death of J.O., brother R.C. rested not, but as soon as he could, 
  called the rest together (and as we suppose) then his grave was made. Although 
  hitherto we (who were the latest) did not know when our loving father R.C. died, 
  and had no more but the bare names of the beginners, and all their successors, 
  to us, yet there came into our memory a secret, which through dark and hidden 
  words, and speeches of the 100 years, brother A., the successor of D. (who was 
  of the last and second row and succession, and had lived amongst many of us) 
  did impart unto us of the third row and succession. Otherwise we must confess, 
  that after the death of the said A. none of us had in any manner known anything 
  of brother R.C. and of his first fellow-brethren, than that which was extant 
  of them in our philosophical <I>Bibliotheca</I>, amongst which our <I>Axiomata</I> 
  was held for the chiefest, <I>Rota Mundi</I> for the most artificial, and <I>Protheus 
  </I>the most profitable. Likewise we do not certainly know if these of the second 
  row have been of the like wisdom as the first, and if they were admitted to 
  all things. It shall be declared hereafter to the gentle Reader, not only what 
  we have heard of the burial of R.C., but also made manifest publicly by the 
  foresight, sufferance, and commandment of God, whom we most faithfully obey, 
  that if we shall be answered discreetly and Christian-like, we will not be afraid 
  to set forth publicly in print our names and surnames, our meetings, or anything 
  else that may be required at our hands.</P>
<P>Now the true and fundamental relation of the finding out of the high illuminated 
  man of God, Fra<I>.</I> C.R.C. is this. After that A. in <I>Gallia Narbonensis</I> 
  was deceased, then succeeded in his place our loving brother N.N. This man after 
  he had repaired unto us to take the solemn oath of fidelity and secrecy, he 
  informed us <I>bona fide,</I> that A. had comforted him in telling him that 
  this Fraternity should ere long not remain so hidden, but should be to all the 
  whole German nation helpful, needful, and commendable; of the which he was not 
  in any wise in his estate ashamed of. The year following, after he had performed 
  his school right and was minded now to travel, being for that purpose sufficiently 
  provided with Fortunatus' purse, he thought (he being a good architect) to alter 
  something of his building and to make it more fit. In such renewing he lighted 
  upon the memorial table which was cast of brass, and containeth all the names 
  of the brethren, with some few other things. This he would transfer in another 
  more fitting vault; for where or when Fra R.C. died, or in what country he was 
  buried, was by our predecessors concealed and unknown to us. In this table stuck 
  a great nail somewhat strong, so that when he was with force drawn out, he took 
  with him an indifferently big stone out of the thin wall, or plastering, of 
  the hidden door, and so, unlooked for, uncovered the door. wherefore we did 
  with by and longing throw down the rest of the wall, and cleared the door) upon 
  which was written in great letters, <I>Post 120 annos patebo</I>,<SUP>(6)</SUP> 
  with the year of the Lord under it. Therefore we gave God thanks and let it 
  rest that same night, because we would first overlook our <I>Rotam</I>. But 
  we refer ourselves again to the Confession, for what we here publish is done 
  for the help of those that are worthy, but to the unworthy (God willing) it 
  will he small profit. For like as our door was after so many years wonderfully 
  discovered, also there shall be opened a door to Europe (when the wall is removed) 
  which already doth begin to appear, and with great desire is expected of many.</P>
<P>In the morning following we opened the door, and there appeared to our sight 
  a vault of seven sides and corners, every side five foot broad, and the height 
  of eight foot. Although the sun never shined in this vault, nevertheless it 
  was enlightened with another sun, which had learned this from the sun, and was 
  situated in the upper part in the center of the ceiling. In the midst, instead 
  of a tombstone, was a round altar covered over with a plate of brass, and thereon 
  this engraven:</P>
<I> 
<P>A.C.R.C. Hoc universi compendium unius mihi sepulchrum feci <SUP>(7)</SUP></P>
</I><SUP> </SUP> 
<P>Round about the first circle, or brim, stood, <I>Jesus mihi omnia </I><SUP>(8)</SUP></P>
<P>In the middle were four figures, inclosed in circles, whose circumscription 
  was,</P>
<P>1. <I>Nequaquam vacuum</I>.<SUP>(9)</SUP></P>
<P>2. <I>Legis Jugum</I>.<SUP>(10)</SUP></P>
<P>3. <I>Libertas Evangelii</I>.<SUP>(11)</SUP></P>
<P>4. <I>Dei gloria intacta.</I><SUP>(12)</SUP></P>
<P> This is all clear and bright; as also the seven sides and the two <I>Heptagoni</I>: 
  so we kneeled altogether down, and gave thanks to the sole wise, sole mighty 
  and sole eternal God, who hath taught us more than all men's wits could have 
  found out, praised be his holy name. This vault we parted in three parts, the 
  upper part or ceiling, the wall or side, the ground or floor.</P>
<P>Of the upper part you shall understand no more of it at this time, but that 
  it was divided according to the seven sides in the triangle, which was in the 
  bright center; but what therein is contained, you shall God willing (that are 
  desirous of our society) behold the same with your own eyes; but every side 
  or wall is parted into ten figures, every one with their several figures and 
  sentences, as they are truly shown and set forth <I>Concentratum</I> here in 
  our book.</P>
<P>The bottom again is parted in the triangle, but because therein is described 
  the power and the rule of the inferior governors, we leave to manifest the same, 
  for fear of the abuse by the evil and ungodly world. But those that are provided 
  and stored with the heavenly antidote, they do without fear or hurt tread on 
  and bruise the head of the old and evil serpent, which this our age is well 
  fitted for. Every side or wall had a door or chest, wherein there lay divers 
  things, especially all our books, which otherwise we had. Besides the <I>Vocabular 
  </I>of <I>Theoph: Par. Ho.</I> <SUP>(13)</SUP> and these which daily unfalsifieth 
  we do participate. Herein also we found his <I>Itinerarium</I> and <I>vitam</I>, 
  whence this relation for the most part is taken. In another chest were looking-glasses 
  of divers virtues, as also in another place were little bells, burning lamps, 
  and chiefly wonderful artificial songs, generally all done to that end, that 
  if it should happen after many hundred years the Order or Fraternity should 
  come to nothing, they might by this only vault be restored again.</P>
<P>Now as yet we had not seen the dead body of our careful and wise father, we 
  therefore removed the altar aside, there we lifted up a strong plate of brass, 
  and found a fair and worthy body, whole and unconsumed, as the same is here 
  lively counterfeited, with all his ornaments and attires. In his hand he held 
  a parchment book, called I., the which next unto the Bible is our greatest treasure, 
  which ought to be delivered to the censure of the world. At the end of this 
  book standeth this following Elogium:</P>
<I> 
<P>Granum pectori Jesu insitum.</P>
<P>C. Ros. C. ex nobili atque splendida Germaniae R.C. familia oriundus, vir sui

</I> 
<P><SUP> </SUP>At that time was already dead brother I.O. and Fra. D. but their 
  burial place where is it to be found? We doubt not but our Fra. Senior hath 
  the same, and some especial thing laid in earth, and perhaps likewise hidden. 
  We also hope that this our example will stir up others more diligently to inquire 
  after their names (whom we have therefore published) and to search for the place 
  of their burial; for the most part of them, by reason of their practise and 
  physic, are yet known, and praised among very old folks; so might perhaps our 
  Gaza be enlarged, or at least be better cleared.</P>
<P>Concerning <I>Minutum Mundum</I>, we found it kept in another little altar, 
  truly more fine than can be imagined by any understanding man; but we will leave 
  him undescribed, until we shall truly be answered upon this our true hearted 
  <I>Fama</I>. And so we have covered it again with the plates, and set the altar 
  thereon, shut the door, and made it sure, with all our seals. Besides by instruction 
  and command of our <I>Rota</I>, there are come to sight some books, among which 
  is contained M. (which were made instead of household care by the praiseworthy 
  M.P.). Finally we departed the one from the other, and left the natural heirs 
  in possession of our jewels. And so we do expect the answer and judgment of 
  the learned, or unlearned.</P>
<P>Howbeit we know after a time there will now be a general reformation, both 
  of divine and human things, according to our desire, and the expectation of 
  others. For it is fitting, that before the rising of the sun, there should appear 
  and break forth <I>Aurora</I>, or some clearness, or divine light in the sky. 
  And so in the mean time some few, who shall give their names, may join together, 
  thereby to increase the number and respect of our Fraternity, and make a happy 
  and wished for beginning of our <I>Philosophical Canons</I>, prescribed to us 
  by our brother R.C., and be partakers with us of our treasures (which never 
  can fail or be wasted), in all humility and love to be eased of this world's 
  labour, and not walk so blindly in the knowledge of the wonder-fill works of 
  God.</P>
<P>But that also every Christian may know of what religion and belief we are, 
  we confess to have the knowledge of Jesus Christ (as the same now in these last 
  days, and chiefly in Germany, most clear and pure is professed, and is nowadays 
  cleansed and void of all swerving people, heretics, and false prophets), in 
  certain noted countries maintained, defended and propagated. Also we use two 
  Sacraments, as they are instituted with all forms and ceremonies of the first 
  reformed Church. In <I>Politia</I> we acknowledge the Roman Empire and <I>Quartam 
  Monarchiam</I> for our Christian head; albeit we know what alterations be at 
  hand, and would fain impart the same with all our hearts to other godly learned 
  men; notwithstanding our hand-writing which is in our hands, no man (except 
  God alone) can make it common, nor any unworthy person is able to bereave us 
  of it. But we shall help with secret aid this so good a cause, as God shall 
  permit or hinder us. For our God is not blind, as the heathen Fortuna, but is 
  the Church's ornament, and the honour of the Temple. Our Philosophy also is 
  not a new invention, but as <I>Adam</I> after his fall hath received it) and 
  as <I>Moses</I> and <I>Solomon</I> used it. Also she ought not much to be doubted 
  of; or contradicted by other opinions, or meanings; but seeing the truth is 
  peaceable, brief; and always like herself in all things, and especially accorded 
  by with <I>Jesus in omni parte</I> and all members. And as he is the true Image 
  of the Father, so is she his Image. It shall not be said, this is true according 
  to <I>Philosophy</I>, but true according to <I>Theologie</I>. And wherein <I>Plato, 
  Aristotle, Pythagoras</I> and others did hit the mark, and wherein <I>Enoch, 
  Abraham, Moses, Solomon</I> did excel, but especially wherewith that wonderful 
  book the Bible agreeth. All that same concurreth together, and makes a sphere 
  or Globe, whose total parts are equidistant from the Centre, as hereof more 
  at large and more plain shall be spoken of in Christianly conference.</P>
<P>But now concerning (and chiefly in this our age) the ungodly and accursed <I>gold-making</I>, 
  which hath gotten so much the upper hand, whereby under colour of it, many runagates 
  and roguish people do use great villanies and cozen and abuse the credit which 
  is given them. Yea nowadays men of discretion do hold the transmutation of metals 
  to be the highest point and <I>fastigium</I> in <I>philosophy</I>, this is all 
  their intent and desire, and that God would be most esteemed by them, and honoured, 
  which could make great store of gold, and in abundance, the which with unpremeditate 
  prayers, they hope to attain of the all-knowing God, and searcher of all hearts. 
  We therefore do by these presents publicly testify, that the true philosophers 
  are far of another mind, esteeming little the making of gold, which is but a 
  <I>parergon</I>; for besides that they have a thousand better things.</P>
<P>And we say with our loving father R.C.C<I>. Phy: aurum nisi quantum: aurum</I>, 
  for unto them the whole nature is detected: he doth not rejoice that he can 
  make gold, and that, as saith Christ, the devils are obedient unto him; but 
  is glad that he seeth the heavens open, and the angels of God ascending and 
  descending, and his name written in the book of life. Also we do testify that 
  under the name of <I>Chymia</I> many books and pictures are set forth in <I>Contumeliam 
  gloriae Dei</I>, as we will name them in their due season, and will give to 
  the pure-hearted a Catalogue, or register of them. And we pray all learned men 
  to take heed of these kind of books; for the enemy never resteth but soweth 
  his weeds, till a stronger one doth root it out. So according to the will and 
  meaning of <I>Fra C.R.C.</I> we his brethren request again all the learned in 
  Europe who shall read (sent forth in five languages) this our <I>Famam</I> and 
  <I>Confessionem,</I> that it would please them with good deliberation to ponder 
  this our offer, and to examine most nearly and most sharply their arts, and 
  behold the present time with all diligence, and to declare their mind, either 
  <I>Communicatio consilio</I>, or <I>singulatim</I> by print.And although at 
  this time we make no mention either of names or meetings, yet nevertheless everyone's 
  opinion shall assuredly come to our hands, in what language so ever it be; nor 
  anybody shall fail, who so gives his name, but to speak with some of us, either 
  by word of mouth, or else, if there be some let, in writing. And this we say 
  for a truth, that whosoever shall earnestly, and from his heart, bear affection 
  unto us, it shall be beneficial to him in goods, body, and soul; but he that 
  is false-hearted, or only greedy of riches, the same first of all shall not 
  be able in any manner of wise to hurt us, but bring himself to utter ruin and 
  destruction. Also our building (although one hundred thousand people had very 
  near seen and beheld the same) shall for ever remain untouched, undestroyed, 
  and hidden to the wicked world.</P>

  sprung from the noble and renowned German family of R.C.: a man admitted into 
  the mysteries and secrets of heaven and earth through the divine revelations, 
  subtle cognitions and unwearied toil of his life. In his journeys through Arabia 
  and Africa he collected a treasure surpassing that of Kings and Emperors; but 
  finding it not suitable for his times, he kept it guarded for posterity to uncover, 
  and appointed loyal and faithful heirs of his arts and also of his name. He 
  constructed a microcosm corresponding in all motions to the macrocosm and finally 
  drew up this compendium of things past, present and to come. Then, having now 
  passed the century of years, though oppressed by no disease, which he had neither 
  felt in his own body nor allowed to attack others, but summoned by the Spirit 
  of God, amid the last embraces of his brethren he rendered up his illuminated 
  soul to God his Creator. A beloved Father, an affectionate Brother, a faithful 
  Teacher, a loyal Friend. He was hidden by his disciples for 120 years.&quot;</FONT></P>
