    <span class="p-small2"> 
    <P> Publius Vergilius Maro was born on the 15th of October, 70 B.C.E., near 
      Mantua. He is primarily known as the author of the Aeneid, the epic poem 
      which links the birth of Rome to the Trojan war, and thus to the <A HREF="../homer/index.htm">Homeric 
      Cycle</A>. The Aeneid is considered the pinnacle of classical Latin literature. 
      His heroic and tragic characters such as Aeneas, and the Queen of Carthage, 
      Dido, are memorable; the poetics of the Aeneid are exceptional, and the 
      text has been used for generations to teach Latin. Two other minor works, 
      the Eclogues (Pastorals) and the Georgics, have survived as well.</P>
    <P> This act of patriotic myth-building gained him the praise of the Emperor 
      Augustus. He spent most of his life in Campania, near Sorrento and Posilipo; 
      it is known that he also visited Greece briefly. Virgil does not show up 
      in any contemporary accounts and he apparently had few intimate friendships. 
      However, he was known as a virtuous and modest man, and although he gained 
      vast public recognition during his lifetime, he is described as being embarrassed 
      by his celebrity status on his rare visits to Rome. Unlike other poets such 
      as <A HREF="../ovid/index.htm">Ovid</A>, who wrote about intimate details 
      of his personal life, Virgils' poetry was on topics of broad scale, from 
      agriculture to nation building, so we know little about his internal life 
      from his poems. </P>
    <P> Virgil died on September 21st, 19. B.C.E., at Brindisi, and his ashes 
      were entombed near Naples in Posilipo. His tomb, which once was treated 
      like a shrine, has disappeared. Supposedly his epitaph was <I>Mantua me 
      genuit; Calabri rapuere; tenet nunc Parthenope. Cecini pascua, rura, duces</I> 
      (Mantua gave birth to me, the Calabrians took me, now Naples holds me; I 
      sang of pastures [the Eclogues], country [the Georgics] and leaders [the 
      Aeneiad]). Virgil is widely acknowledged as a poetic genius. St. Augustine 
      admired him, and Dante considered 
      Virgil a primary inspiration for his own poetic world-building exercise; 
      symbolically, Virgil is Dante's escort through the Inferno. Of course Aeneas 
      made his own visit to the underworld... </P>
