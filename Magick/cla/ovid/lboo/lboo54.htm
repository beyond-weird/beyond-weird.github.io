<P>WHAT day was that, ye birds of mournful plumage, when ye sang things of evil. presage to my love-affairs? What star shall I suspect is moving counter to my fate, what gods shall I complain are making war against me? The woman who but now confessed herself my own, of whom I was the first the only lover, to-day I fear I share with many rivals.</P>
<P>Am I at fault, or is it my verses that have made her the talk? 'Tis even so. My genius hath made of her a wanton. And I deserve it. For why did I vaunt her beauty? If she sells herself to-day, mine is the fault. I am the power that hath made her please; 'tis I who have brought her lovers; these hands have opened the door to them.</P>
<P>Whether verses are good for aught, I much misdoubt me; they have always wrought me ill. 'Twas they excited envy of my treasure.</P>
<P>Though of Thebes I might sing, and Troy and C&aelig;sar's mighty deeds, Corinna alone could fire my genius. Would to heaven that the Muses had been unfavourable to my songs and that Phœbus had deserted me when my task was but begun. Yet since it is the custom to give ear to what the poets say, I should not have wished my verses to have had no weight.</P>
<P>'Tis we who sang of Scylla stealing from her father's head his treasured locks and hiding in her womb the raging dogs. 'Tis we who have given wings to the feet and serpents to the hair, our song gave victory to Abos' child and the wing&egrave;d horse. 'Tis we gave Tityos his mighty stature, and to Cerberus gave his triple mouths and his serpent-crown&egrave;d head. Enceladus we made hurling the spear with a thousand arms, and through us a youthful sorceress overcame heroes by her magic spells. We imprisoned the winds of &AElig;olus in the wine-skins of the Ithacan king; we made the prying Tantalus go mad with thirst, with water all around him; Niobe we changed into a rock, and a young maiden into a bear. 'Tis thanks to us that the bird of Cecrops sings Odrysian Itys; that Jove transforms himself into a bird, or into gold, or, taking on the semblance of a bull, cleaves the waters with a maiden on his back. Why tell of Proteus and those dragon's teeth whence sprang the Thebans? Shall I tell of the bulls that spewed forth flames, and of the tears of amber that flowed, Orega, from thy sister's cheeks; of ships changed into sea goddesses; of the sun shrinking in horror from the sight of Atreus' dreadful feast and of the rocks that followed the music of the lyre?</P>
<P>Unceasing the genius of the poets pours forth, and recks not of the trammels of historic truth. Thus the praises of my mistress should have been looked upon as false. I have been undone by your credulity.</P>
