When I first saw learned of the existence of this book, I was a little
suprised, since very little concrete information is available on this
topic, and even less was known in 1917.
However, to paraphrase a recent President of the United States,
<CITE>Myths of Crete</CITE> depends on what your definition of <I>of</I> is....
</P>
<P>
There is substantial mythology <I>about</I> Crete.
The Minoan civilization, which predated the better known classical
Hellenic period by several hundred years, disappeared catastrophically,
battered by volcanic eruptions and barbarian incursions.
Successive generations, starting with the classical Greeks, created
a vast number of myths about the vanished sea-empire.
The Homeric epics, Daedalus and Icarus,
King Minos and the Minotaur, and even, as Mackenzie
points out, Atlantis, were all influenced by hearsay and
speculation about the lost Cretan empire.</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 20th century archeologists
finally started to excavate the 
Minoan ruins. Based lagely on circumstantial evidence such as
the vivid wall art
and the startling Goddess iconography, popularizers like Mackenzie
built an entire new set of myths about the ancient Cretans.
This mythology was eagerly adopted by neo-pagans, starting with
Robert Graves, who wrote a little-known science fiction novel on the subject,
<CITE>Watch the Northwind Rise</CITE>.
</P>
<P>
What do we actually know about Minoan mythology as of today?
In a word, nothing.
The Minoans developed the first known European writing systems,
known as Linear A and B.
Linear B was deciphered by Michael Ventris in 1952.
Only commercial documents have been found, as befits
a sea-trading empire.
The other Minoan script, Linear A, remains a mystery.
Although the phonetic values of some Linear A symbols have
been tenatively identified, they have yet to be translated.
So we have no translated Minoan religious documents to work with,
although we can infer that certain Linear A texts are magical
or religious in nature because they are inscribed on ritual objects.
</P>
We can assume from the prevelence of female images in ritual
contexts that the Minoans worshipped one or more Goddesses.
We also know that animals played an important role in their rituals,
particularly snakes and bulls.
However, any attempt at this point to make definite statements about
their mythology or spiritual practices is inferential at best.
</P>
<P>
One factual correction must be noted.
The story of Schliemann's Atlantis bequest, reported in <A HREF="moc10.htm#page_98">Chapter V, page 98</A>,
turned out to be a complete hoax.
This yarn appeared in a sensationalist Hearst newspaper in 1914,
and as this book was written only a few years later, we
can probably forgive Mackenzie for reporting it as fact.
The entire article,
<I><A HREF="../../atl/hif/index.htm">How I found the Lost Atlantis</A></I>,
along with our analysis of it, is also at BeyondWeird.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Mackenzie, who
also wrote
<CITE><A HREF="../../egy/eml/index.htm">Myths and Legends of Ancient Egypt</A></CITE>,
manages to stretch the subject matter out into a full 300 page book.
Informative, well researched and very readable,
<CITE>Myths of Crete</CITE> is a 
unique book about a very opaque period of history.
