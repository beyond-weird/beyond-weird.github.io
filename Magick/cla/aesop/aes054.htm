<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">The Sick Stag</H1>
<P>A SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. His companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, and each one helped himself to a share of the food which had been placed for his use; so that he died, not from his sickness, but from the failure of the means of living.</P>
<P>Evil companions bring more hurt than profit.</P>
