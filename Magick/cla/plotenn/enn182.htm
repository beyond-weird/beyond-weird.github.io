<P>7. It remains to notice the theory of the one Causing-Principle
alleged to interweave everything with everything else, to make
things into a chain, to determine the nature and condition of each
phenomenon- a Principle which, acting through seminal Reason-Forms-
Logoi Spermatikoi- elaborates all that exists and happens.

<P>The doctrine is close to that which makes the Soul of 
the Universe
the source and cause of all condition and of all movement whether
without or- supposing that we are allowed as individuals some little
power towards personal act- within ourselves.

<P>But it is the theory of the most rigid and universal Necessity:
all the causative forces enter into the system, and so every several
phenomenon rises necessarily; where nothing escapes Destiny, nothing
has power to check or to change. Such forces beating upon us, as it
were, from one general cause leave us no resource but to go 
where they
drive. All our ideas will be determined by a chain of 
previous causes;
our doings will be determined by those ideas; personal action
becomes a mere word. That we are the agents does not save our
freedom when our action is prescribed by those causes; we have
precisely what belongs to everything that lives, to infants guided
by blind impulses, to lunatics; all these act; why, even fire acts;
there is act in everything that follows the plan of its being,
servilely.

<P>No one that sees the implications of this theory can hesitate:
unable to halt at such a determinant principle, we seek for other
explanations of our action.
