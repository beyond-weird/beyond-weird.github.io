<P>7. Well but can they not tell themselves that yesterday, or last
year, they moved round the earth, that they lived yesterday or at
any given moment in their lives?

<P>Their living is eternal, and eternity is an unchanging unity. To
identify a yesterday or a last year in their movement would be like
isolating the movement of one of the feet, and finding a this or a
that and an entire series in what is a single act. The 
movement of the
celestial beings is one movement: it is our measuring that 
presents us
with many movements, and with distinct days determined by
intervening nights: There all is one day; series has no place; no
yesterday, no last year.

<P>Still: the space traversed is different; there are the various
sections of the Zodiac: why, then, should not the soul say "I have
traversed that section and now I am in this other?" If, 
also, it looks
down over the concerns of men, must it not see the changes 
that befall
them, that they are not as they were, and, by that observation, that
the beings and the things concerned were otherwise formerly? And
does not that mean memory?
