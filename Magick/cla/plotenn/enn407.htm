<P>8. And- if it is desirable to venture the more definite
statement of a personal conviction clashing with the general view-
even our human soul has not sunk entire; something of it is
continuously in the Intellectual Realm, though if that part, which
is in this sphere of sense, hold the mastery, or rather be mastered
here and troubled, it keeps us blind to what the upper phase holds
in contemplation.

<P>The object of the Intellectual Act comes within our ken only
when it reaches downward to the level of sensation: for not all that
occurs at any part of the soul is immediately known to us; a thing
must, for that knowledge, be present to the total soul; thus desire
locked up within the desiring faculty remains unknown except when we
make it fully ours by the central faculty of perception, or by the
individual choice or by both at once. Once more, every soul has
something of the lower on the body side and something of the 
higher on
the side of the Intellectual-Principle.

<P>The Soul of the All, as an entirety, governs the universe
through that part of it which leans to the body side, but since it
does not exercise a will based on calculation as we do- but proceeds
by purely intellectual act as in the execution of an artistic
conception- its ministrance is that of a labourless overpoising,
only its lowest phase being active upon the universe it embellishes.

<P>The souls that have gone into division and become appropriated
to some thing partial have also their transcendent phase, but are
preoccupied by sensation, and in the mere fact of exercising
perception they take in much that clashes with their nature 
and brings
distress and trouble since the object of their concern is partial,
deficient, exposed to many alien influences, filled with desires of
its own and taking its pleasure, that pleasure which is its lure.

<P>But there is always the other, that which finds no savour in
passing pleasure, but holds its own even way.
