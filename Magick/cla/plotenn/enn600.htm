<P>11. Still, this integral omnipresence admitted, why do not all
things participate in the Intellectual Order in its entirety? Why
has it a first participant, a second, and so on?

<P>We can but see that presence is determined by the fitness of the
participant so that, while Being is omnipresent to the realm 
of Being,
never falling short of itself, yet only the competent possess
themselves of that presence which depends not upon situation but
upon adequacy; the transparent object and the opaque answer very
differently to the light. These firsts, seconds, thirds, of
participance are determined by rank, by power, not by place but by
differentiation; and difference is no bar to coexistence, 
witness soul
and Intellectual-Principle: similarly our own knowledge, the trivial
next the gravest; one and the same object yields colour to our
sight, fragrance to smell, to every sense a particular 
experience, all
presented simultaneously.

<P>But would not this indicate that the Authentic is diverse,
multiple?

<P>That diversity is simplex still; that multiple is one; 
for it is a
Reason-Principle, which is to say a unity in variety: all Being is
one; the differing being is still included in Being; the
differentiation is within Being, obviously not within 
non-Being. Being
is bound up with the unity which is never apart from it; wheresoever
Being appears, there appears its unity; and the unity of Being is
self-standing, for presence in the sensible does not abrogate
independence: things of sense are present to the Intellectual- where
this occurs- otherwise than as the Intellectual is present within
itself; so, too, body's presence to soul differs from that of
knowledge to soul; one item of knowledge is present in a 
different way
than another; a body's presence to body is, again, another form of
relation.
