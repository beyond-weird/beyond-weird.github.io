<P>8. As for violent personal sufferings, he will carry them off as
well as he can; if they overpass his endurance they will carry him
off.

<P>And so in all his pain he asks no pity: there is always the
radiance in the inner soul of the man, untroubled like the light in
a lantern when fierce gusts beat about it in a wild turmoil of wind
and tempest.

<P>But what if he be put beyond himself? What if pain grow 
so intense
and so torture him that the agony all but kills? Well, when he is
put to torture he will plan what is to be done: he retains 
his freedom
of action.

<P>Besides we must remember that the Sage sees things very
differently from the average man; neither ordinary experiences nor
pains and sorrows, whether touching himself or others, pierce to the
inner hold. To allow them any such passage would be a weakness in
our soul.

<P>And it is a sign of weakness, too, if we should think it gain
not to hear of miseries, gain to die before they come: this is not
concern for others' welfare but for our own peace of mind. 
Here we see
our imperfection: we must not indulge it, we must put it from us and
cease to tremble over what perhaps may be.

<P>Anyone that says that it is in human nature to grieve over
misfortune to our household must learn that this is not so with all,
and that, precisely, it is virtue's use to raise the general level
of nature towards the better and finer, above the mass of 
men. And the
finer is to set at nought what terrifies the common mind.

<P>We cannot be indolent: this is an arena for the powerful 
combatant
holding his ground against the blows of fortune, and knowing that,
sore though they be to some natures, they are little to his, nothing
dreadful, nursery terrors.

<P>So, the Sage would have desired misfortune?

<P>It is precisely to meet the undesired when it appears that he
has the virtue which gives him, to confront it, his passionless and
unshakeable soul.
