<P>14. (19) As for the souls of the other living beings, fallen to
the degree of entering brute bodies, these too must be immortal. And
if there is in the animal world any other phase of soul, its only
possible origin, since it is the life-giver, is, still, that one
principle of life: so too with the soul in the vegetal order.

<P>All have sprung from one source, all have life as their own, all
are incorporeal, indivisible, all are real-beings.

<P>If we are told that man's soul being tripartite must as 
a compound
entity be dissolved, our answer shall be that pure souls upon their
emancipation will put away all that has fastened to them at 
birth, all
that increment which the others will long retain.

<P>But even that inferior phase thus laid aside will not be 
destroyed
as long as its source continues to exist, for nothing from the realm
of real being shall pass away.
