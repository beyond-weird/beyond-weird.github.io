<P>19. Having established our four primary genera, it remains for
us to enquire whether each of them of itself alone produces species.
And especially, can Being be divided independently, that is without
drawing upon the other genera? Surely not: the differentiae must come
from outside the genus differentiated: they must be differentiae of
Being proper, but cannot be identical with it.

<P>Where then is it to find them? Obviously not in non-beings. If
then in beings, and the three genera are all that is left, clearly
it must find them in these, by conjunction and couplement with
these, which will come into existence simultaneously with itself.

<P>But if all come into existence simultaneously, what else is
produced but that amalgam of all Existents which we have just
considered [Intellect]? How can other things exist over and 
above this
all-including amalgam? And if all the constituents of this 
amalgam are
genera, how do they produce species? How does Motion produce species
of Motion? Similarly with Stability and the other genera.

<P>A word of warning must here be given against sinking the various
genera in their species; and also against reducing the genus 
to a mere
predicate, something merely seen in the species. The genus must
exist at once in itself and in its species; it blends, but it must
also be pure; in contributing along with other genera to form
Substance, it must not destroy itself. There are problems here that
demand investigation.

<P>But since we identified the amalgam of the Existents [or primary
genera] with the particular intellect, Intellect as such being found
identical with Being or Substance, and therefore prior to all the
Existents, which may be regarded as its species or members, we may
infer that the intellect, considered as completely unfolded, is a
subsequent.

<P>Our treatment of this problem may serve to promote our
investigation; we will take it as a kind of example, and with it
embark upon our enquiry.
