<P>7. The Kind, then, with which we are dealing is twofold, the
Intellectual against the sensible: better for the soul to 
dwell in the
Intellectual, but, given its proper nature, it is under compulsion
to participate in the sense-realm also. There is no grievance in its
not being, through and through, the highest; it holds mid-rank among
the authentic existences, being of divine station but at the lowest
extreme of the Intellectual and skirting the sense-known 
nature; thus,
while it communicates to this realm something of its own store, it
absorbs in turn whenever- instead of employing in its government
only its safeguarded phase- it plunges in an excessive zeal to the
very midst of its chosen sphere; then it abandons its status as
whole soul with whole soul, though even thus it is always able to
recover itself by turning to account the experience of what it has
seen and suffered here, learning, so, the greatness of rest in the
Supreme, and more clearly discerning the finer things by comparison
with what is almost their direct antithesis. Where the faculty is
incapable of knowing without contact, the experience of evil brings
the dearer perception of Good.

<P>The outgoing that takes place in the Intellectual-Principle is a
descent to its own downward ultimate: it cannot be a movement to the
transcendent; operating necessarily outwards from itself, wherein it
may not stay inclosed, the need and law of Nature bring it to its
extreme term, to soul- to which it entrusts all the later stages of
being while itself turns back on its course.

<P>The soul's operation is similar: its next lower act is this
universe: its immediate higher is the contemplation of the Authentic
Existences. To individual souls such divine operation takes 
place only
at one of their phases and by a temporal process when from the lower
in which they reside they turn towards the noblest; but that soul,
which we know as the All-Soul, has never entered the lower activity,
but, immune from evil, has the property of knowing its lower by
inspection, while it still cleaves continuously to the beings above
itself; thus its double task becomes possible; it takes thence and,
since as soul it cannot escape touching this sphere, it gives hither.
