<P>2. Supposing we accept this view and hold that, while 
things below
the moon's orb have merely type-persistence, the celestial realm and
all its several members possess individual eternity; it remains to
show how this strict permanence of the individual identity- 
the actual
item eternally unchangeable- can belong to what is certainly
corporeal, seeing that bodily substance is characteristically a
thing of flux.

<P>The theory of bodily flux is held by Plato no less than by the
other philosophers who have dealt with physical matters, and is
applied not only to ordinary bodies but to those, also, of the
heavenly sphere.

<P>"How," he asks, "can these corporeal and visible 
entities continue
eternally unchanged in identity?"- evidently agreeing, in this
matter also, with Herakleitos who maintained that even the sun is
perpetually coming anew into being. To Aristotle there would be no
problem; it is only accepting his theories of a fifth-substance.

<P>But to those who reject Aristotle's Quintessence and hold the
material mass of the heavens to consist of the elements 
underlying the
living things of this sphere, how is individual permanence possible?
And the difficulty is still greater for the parts, for the 
sun and the
heavenly bodies.

<P>Every living thing is a combination of soul and body-kind: the
celestial sphere, therefore, if it is to be everlasting as an
individual entity must be so in virtue either of both these
constituents or of one of them, by the combination of soul 
and body or
by soul only or by body only.

<P>Of course anyone that holds body to be incorruptible secures the
desired permanence at once; no need, then, to call on a soul 
or on any
perdurable conjunction to account for the continued maintenance of a
living being.

<P>But the case is different when one holds that body is, of
itself, perishable and that Soul is the principle of permanence:
this view obliges us to the proof that the character of body 
is not in
itself fatal either to the coherence or to the lasting 
stability which
are imperative: it must be shown that the two elements of the union
envisaged are not inevitably hostile, but that on the 
contrary [in the
heavens] even Matter must conduce to the scheme of the standing
result.
