<P>11. Since there is a Soul which reasons upon the right and good-
for reasoning is an enquiry into the rightness and goodness of this
rather than that- there must exist some permanent Right, the source
and foundation of this reasoning in our soul; how, else, could any
such discussion be held? Further, since the soul's attention to
these matters is intermittent, there must be within us an
Intellectual-Principle acquainted with that Right not by 
momentary act
but in permanent possession. Similarly there must be also the
principle of this principle, its cause, God. This Highest cannot be
divided and allotted, must remain intangible but not bound to space,
it may be present at many points, wheresoever there is anything
capable of accepting one of its manifestations; thus a centre is an
independent unity; everything within the circle has its term at the
centre; and to the centre the radii bring each their own. Within our
nature is such a centre by which we grasp and are linked and 
held; and
those of us are firmly in the Supreme whose collective tendency is
There.
