<P>7. Knowledge in the reasoning soul is on the one side concerned
with objects of sense, though indeed this can scarcely be called
knowledge and is better indicated as opinion or 
surface-knowing; it is
of later origin than the objects since it is a reflection from them:
but on the other hand there is the knowledge handling the 
intellectual
objects and this is the authentic knowledge; it enters the reasoning
soul from the Intellectual-Principle and has no dealing with
anything in sense. Being true knowledge it actually is everything of
which it takes cognisance; it carries as its own content the
intellectual act and the intellectual object since it carries the
Intellectual-Principle which actually is the primals and is always
self-present and is in its nature an Act, never by any want forced
to seek, never acquiring or traversing the remote- for all such
experience belongs to soul- but always self-gathered, the very Being
of the collective total, not an extern creating things by the act of
knowing them.

<P>Not by its thinking God does God come to be; not by its thinking
Movement does Movement arise. Hence it is an error to call the Ideas
intellections in the sense that, upon an intellectual act in this
Principle, one such Idea or another is made to exist or exists. No:
the object of this intellection must exist before the 
intellective act
[must be the very content not the creation of the
Intellectual-Principle]. How else could that Principle come to know
it: certainly not [as an external] by luck or by haphazard search.
