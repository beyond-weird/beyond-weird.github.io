<P>2. What, then, of the "Number of the Infinite"?

<P>To begin with, how is Number consistent with infinity?

<P>Objects of sense are not unlimited and therefore the Number
applying to them cannot be so. Nor is an enumerator able to number
to infinity; though we double, multiply over and over again, we
still end with a finite number; though we range over past and
future, and consider them, even, as a totality, we still end with
the finite.

<P>Are we then to dismiss absolute limitlessness and think merely
that there is always something beyond?

<P>No; that more is not in the reckoner's power to produce; 
the total
stands already defined.

<P>In the Intellectual the Beings are determined and with them
Number, the number corresponding to their total; in this 
sphere of our
own- as we make a man a multiple by counting up his various
characteristics, his beauty and the rest- we take each image of
Being and form a corresponding image of number; we multiply a
non-existent in and so produce multiple numbers; if we 
number years we
draw on the numbers in our own minds and apply them to the years;
these numbers are still our possession.
