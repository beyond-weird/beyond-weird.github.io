<P>24. With regard to locomotion: if ascending is to be 
held contrary
to descending, and circular motion different [in kind] from motion
in a straight line, we may ask how this difference is to be defined-
the difference, for example, between throwing over the head and
under the feet.

<P>The driving power is one- though indeed it might be maintained
that the upward drive is different from the downward, and 
the downward
passage of a different character from the upward, especially if it
be a natural motion, in which case the up-motion constitutes
lightness, the down-motion heaviness.

<P>But in all these motions alike there is the common tendency to
seek an appointed place, and in this tendency we seem to have the
differentia which separates locomotion from the other species.

<P>As for motion in a circle and motion in a straight line, if the
former is in practice indistinguishable from the latter, how can we
regard them as different? The only difference lies in the 
shape of the
course, unless the view be taken that circular motion is "impure,"
as not being entirely a motion, not involving a complete surrender
of identity.

<P>However, it appears in general that locomotion is a definite
unity, taking its differences from externals.
