<P>1. Are we to think that a being knowing itself must contain
diversity, that self-knowledge can be affirmed only when some one
phase of the self perceives other phases, and that therefore an
absolutely simplex entity would be equally incapable of introversion
and of self-awareness?

<P>No: a being that has no parts or phases may have this
consciousness; in fact there would be no real self-knowing in an
entity presented as knowing itself in virtue of being a 
compound- some
single element in it perceiving other elements- as we may 
know our own
form and entire bodily organism by sense-perception: such 
knowing does
not cover the whole field; the knowing element has not had the
required cognisance at once of its associates and of itself; this is
not the self-knower asked for; it is merely something that knows
something else.

<P>Either we must exhibit the self-knowing of an uncompounded
being- and show how that is possible- or abandon the belief that any
being can possess veritable self-cognition.

<P>To abandon the belief is not possible in view of the many
absurdities thus entailed.

<P>It would be already absurd enough to deny this power to the soul
or mind, but the very height of absurdity to deny it to the nature
of the Intellectual-Principle, presented thus as knowing the rest of
things but not attaining to knowledge, or even awareness, of itself.

<P>It is the province of sense and in some degree of understanding
and judgement, but not of the Intellectual-Principle, to handle the
external, though whether the Intellectual-Principle holds the
knowledge of these things is a question to be examined, but it is
obvious that the Intellectual-Principle must have knowledge of the
Intellectual objects. Now, can it know those objects alone or must
it not simultaneously know itself, the being whose function it is to
know just those things? Can it have self-knowledge in the sense
[dismissed above as inadequate] of knowing its content while it
ignores itself? Can it be aware of knowing its members and yet
remain in ignorance of its own knowing self? Self and content must
be simultaneously present: the method and degree of this knowledge
we must now consider.
