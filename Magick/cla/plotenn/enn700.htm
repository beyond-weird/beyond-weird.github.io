<P>19. Stirred to the Supreme by what has been told, a man must
strive to possess it directly; then he too will see, though still
unable to tell it as he would wish.

<P>One seeing That as it really is will lay aside all reasoning
upon it and simply state it as the self-existent; such that if it
had essence that essence would be subject to it and, so to speak,
derived from it; none that has seen would dare to talk of its
"happening to be," or indeed be able to utter word. With all his
courage he would stand astounded, unable at any venture to speak of
This, with the vision everywhere before the eyes of the soul so
that, look where one may, there it is seen unless one deliberately
look away, ignoring God, thinking no more upon Him. So we are to
understand the Beyond-Essence darkly indicated by the 
ancients: is not
merely that He generated Essence but that He is subject neither to
Essence nor to Himself; His essence is not His Principle; He is
Principle to Essence and not for Himself did He make it; producing
it He left it outside of Himself: He had no need of being who
brought it to be. Thus His making of being is no "action in 
accordance
with His being."
