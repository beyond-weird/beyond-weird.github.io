<P>21. Now what in all these objects of desire is the fundamental
making them good?

<P>We must be bold:

<P>Intellectual-Principle and that life are of the order of good
and hold their desirability, even they, in virtue of 
belonging to that
order; they have their goodness, I mean, because Life is an Activity
in The Good,- Or rather, streaming from The Good- while
Intellectual-Principle is an Activity already defined Therein; both
are of radiant beauty and, because they come Thence and lead
Thither, they are sought after by the soul-sought, that is, as
things congenial though not veritably good while yet, as belonging
to that order not to be rejected; the related, if not good, 
is shunned
in spite of that relationship, and even remote and ignobler 
things may
at times prove attractive.

<P>The intense love called forth by Life and Intellectual-Principle
is due not to what they are but to the consideration of their nature
as something apart, received from above themselves.

<P>Material forms, containing light incorporated in them, need
still a light apart from them that their own light may be manifest;
just so the Beings of that sphere, all lightsome, need another and a
lordlier light or even they would not be visible to themselves and
beyond.
