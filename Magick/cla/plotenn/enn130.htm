<P>9. But how can we conceive a thing having existence 
without having
magnitude?

<P>We have only to think of things whose identity does not depend
on their quantity- for certainly magnitude can be distinguished from
existence as can many other forms and attributes.

<P>In a word, every unembodied Kind must be classed as without
quantity, and Matter is unembodied.

<P>Besides quantitativeness itself [the Absolute-Principle] does
not possess quantity, which belongs only to things participating in
it, a consideration which shows that Quantitativeness is an
Idea-Principle. A white object becomes white by the presence of
whiteness; what makes an organism white or of any other variety of
colour is not itself a specific colour but, so to speak, a specific
Reason-Principle: in the same way what gives an organism a certain
bulk is not itself a thing of magnitude but is Magnitude itself, the
abstract Absolute, or the Reason-Principle.

<P>This Magnitude-Absolute, then, enters and beats the Matter out
into Magnitude?

<P>Not at all: the Matter was not previously shrunken small: there
was no littleness or bigness: the Idea gives Magnitude exactly as it
gives every quality not previously present.
