<P>24. There remains Situation, which like Possession is confined
to a few instances such as reclining and sitting.

<P>Even so, the term is not used without qualification: we say
"they are placed in such and such a manner," "he is situated in such
and such a position." The position is added from outside the genus.

<P>In short, Situation signifies "being in a place"; there are two
things involved, the position and the place: why then must two
categories be combined into one?

<P>Moreover, if sitting signifies an Act, it must be classed among
Acts; if a Passion, it goes under the category to which belong
Passions complete and incomplete.

<P>Reclining is surely nothing but "lying up," and tallies with
"lying down" and "lying midway." But if the reclining belongs thus
to the category of Relation, why not the recliner also? For 
as "on the
right" belongs to the Relations, so does "the thing on the 
right"; and
similarly with "the thing on the left."
