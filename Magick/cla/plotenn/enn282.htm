<P>1. In the Intellectual Kosmos dwells Authentic Essence, with the
Intellectual-Principle [Divine Mind] as the noblest of its content,
but containing also souls, since every soul in this lower sphere has
come thence: that is the world of unembodied spirits while to our
world belong those that have entered body and undergone bodily
division.

<P>There the Intellectual-Principle is a concentrated all- 
nothing of
it distinguished or divided- and in that kosmos of unity all 
souls are
concentrated also, with no spatial discrimination.

<P>But there is a difference:

<P>The Intellectual-Principle is for ever repugnant to distinction
and to partition. Soul, there without distinction and partition, has
yet a nature lending itself to divisional existence: its division is
secession, entry into body.

<P>In view of this seceding and the ensuing partition we may
legitimately speak of it as a partible thing.

<P>But if so, how can it still be described as indivisible?

<P>In that the secession is not of the soul entire; something of it
holds its ground, that in it which recoils from separate existence.

<P>The entity, therefore, described as "consisting of the undivided
soul and of the soul divided among bodies," contains a soul which is
at once above and below, attached to the Supreme and yet 
reaching down
to this sphere, like a radius from a centre.

<P>Thus it is that, entering this realm, it possesses still the
vision inherent to that superior phase in virtue of which it
unchangingly maintains its integral nature. Even here it is not
exclusively the partible soul: it is still the impartible as well:
what in it knows partition is parted without partibility; 
undivided as
giving itself to the entire body, a whole to a whole, it is 
divided as
being effective in every part.
