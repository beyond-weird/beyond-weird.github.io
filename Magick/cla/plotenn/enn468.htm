<P>2. Thus there is the primally intellective and there is that in
which intellection has taken another mode; but this indicates that
what transcends the primarily intellective has no intellection; for,
to have intellection, it must become an Intellectual-Principle, and,
if it is to become that, it must possess an intellectual object and,
as primarily intellective, it must possess that intellectual 
object as
something within itself.

<P>But it is not inevitable that every intellectual object should
both possess the intellective principle in itself and exercise
intellection: at that, it would be not merely object but subject as
well and, besides, being thus dual, could not be primal: further,
the intellectual principle that is to possess the intellectual
object could not cohere unless there existed an essence purely
intellectual, something which, while standing as intellectual object
to the intellectual principle, is in its own essence neither an
agent nor an object of intellection. The intellectual object 
points to
something beyond itself [to a percipient]; and the intellectual
agent has its intellection in vain unless by seizing and holding an
object- since, failing that, it can have no intellection but is
consummated only when it possesses itself of its natural term.

<P>There must have been something standing consummate independently
of any intellectual act, something perfect in its own essence: thus
that in which this completion is inherent must exist before
intellection; in other words it has no need of intellection, having
been always self-sufficing: this, then, will have no 
intellectual act.

<P>Thus we arrive at: a principle having no intellection, a 
principle
having intellection primarily, a principle having it secondarily.

<P>It may be added that, supposing The First to be intellective, it
thereby possesses something [some object, some attribute]: at once
it ceases to be a first; it is a secondary, and not even a unity; it
is a many; it is all of which it takes intellectual possession; even
though its intellection fell solely upon its own content, it must
still be a manifold.
