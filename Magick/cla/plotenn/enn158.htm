<P>3. Ever illuminated, receiving light unfailing, the All-Soul
imparts it to the entire series of later Being which by this light
is sustained and fostered and endowed with the fullest 
measure of life
that each can absorb. It may be compared with a central fire warming
every receptive body within range.

<P>Our fire, however, is a thing of limited scope: given powers
that have no limitation and are never cut off from the Authentic
Existences, how imagine anything existing and yet failing to receive
from them?

<P>It is of the essence of things that each gives of its being to
another: without this communication, The Good would not be Good, nor
the Intellectual-Principle an Intellective Principle, nor would Soul
itself be what it is: the law is, "some life after the Primal Life,
a second where there is a first; all linked in one unbroken 
chain; all
eternal; divergent types being engendered only in the sense of being
secondary."

<P>In other words, things commonly described as generated have
never known a beginning: all has been and will be. Nor can anything
disappear unless where a later form is possible: without 
such a future
there can be no dissolution.

<P>If we are told that there is always Matter as a possible term,
we ask why then should not Matter itself come to nothingness. If we
are told it may, then we ask why it should ever have been generated.
If the answer comes that it had its necessary place as the 
ultimate of
the series, we return that the necessity still holds.

<P>With Matter left aside as wholly isolated, the Divine Beings are
not everywhere but in some bounded place, walled off, so to speak;
if that is not possible, Matter itself must receive the Divine light
[and so cannot be annihilated].
