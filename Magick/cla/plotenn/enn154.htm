<P>2. The explanation by lesser angle of vision has been elsewhere
dismissed; one point, however, we may urge here.

<P>Those attributing the reduced appearance to the lesser angle
occupied allow by their very theory that the unoccupied 
portion of the
eye still sees something beyond or something quite apart from the
object of vision, if only air-space.

<P>Now consider some very large object of vision, that mountain for
example. No part of the eye is unoccupied; the mountain adequately
fills it so that it can take in nothing beyond, for the mountain as
seen either corresponds exactly to the eye-space or 
stretches away out
of range to right and to left. How does the explanation by lesser
angle of vision hold good in this case, where the object 
still appears
smaller, far, than it is and yet occupies the eye entire?

<P>Or look up to the sky and no hesitation can remain. Of course we
cannot take in the entire hemisphere at one glance; the eye directed
to it could not cover so vast an expanse. But suppose the 
possibility:
the entire eye, then, embraces the hemisphere entire; but the
expanse of the heavens is far greater than it appears; how can its
appearing far less than it is be explained by a lessening of 
the angle
of vision?
