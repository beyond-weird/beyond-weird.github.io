<P>2. But the Universe outside; how is it aligned towards the Good?

<P>The soulless by direction toward Soul: Soul towards the Good
itself, through the Intellectual-Principle.

<P>Everything has something of the Good, by virtue of possessing a
certain degree of unity and a certain degree of Existence and by
participation in Ideal-Form: to the extent of the Unity, Being, and
Form which are present, there is a sharing in an image, for the
Unity and Existence in which there is participation are no more than
images of the Ideal-Form.

<P>With Soul it is different; the First-Soul, that which 
follows upon
the Intellectual-Principle, possesses a life nearer to the Verity
and through that Principle is of the nature of good; it will
actually possess the Good if it orientate itself towards the
Intellectual-Principle, since this follows immediately upon the Good.

<P>In sum, then, life is the Good to the living, and the
Intellectual-Principle to what is intellective; so that 
where there is
life with intellection there is a double contact with the Good.
