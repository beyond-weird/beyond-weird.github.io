<P>Donec proterva nil mei manu carpes,<BR>
licebit ipsa sis pudicior Vesta.<BR>
sin, haec mei te ventris arma laxabunt,<BR>
exire ut ipse de tuo queas culo.</P>
<P>Long as thy wanton hand to pluck refrain<BR>
Chaster than Vesta's self thou may'st remain<BR>
Else thee my belly's arm shall loosen so<BR>
Out of thy proper anus thou shalt flow.</P>
<P>So long as thou snatchest nothing from me with audacious hand, thou mayst be chaster than Vesta herself. But, if thou dost, these belly-weapons of mine will so stretch thee that thou wilt be able to slip through thy own anus.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. If on his way to drink at the fountain, the wayfarer plucked the grapes in the orchard guarded by the god, Priapus threatened him with irrumation. He would then require water, not only to quench his thirst, but also to cleanse his mouth. 'Because you suck, and gargle your mouth with water, Lesbia, you do no wrong. You take water where there is need of it, Lesbia.' Following the example of other women, who after coition bathe their privy parts, Lesbia rinses her mouth. The poet calls her Lesbia because the Lesbians were given to this fantasy.]</P>
