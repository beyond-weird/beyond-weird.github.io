      about other lost works of Homer. </span> </P>
    <span class="p-small2"> 
    <P> For over three centuries scholars have debated whether an actual person 
      named Homer existed; some have speculated that the name Homer is actually 
      a collective name for a group of bards (the Homeridae) who redacted (edited) 
      a existing cycle of oral epics about 800 B.C.E. Others believe, based on 
      textual evidence, that one person did compose or redact the two major Homeric 
      compositions. In any case, stating an opinion about this question would 
      be a good way to start a bar fight at a conference of classical scholars....</P>
    <P> Certainly, there are few details about Homer's life. According to classical 
      sources, Homer lived around 1200 B.C.E.; today dates of the 8th or 7th Century 
      B.C.E. are quoted. Homer is traditionally described as being blind--based 
      on one Archaic Greek fragment--but the visual quality of his work makes 
      this hard to believe; perhaps he became blind later in life.</P>
    <P> The Homeric cycle was composed around the same time as the Indian <A HREF="../../hin/rama/index.htm">Ramayana</A>, 
      which it resembles thematically. The entire Homeric cycle, of which the 
      <A HREF="#homer">Iliad and Odyssey</A> are the only complete surviving works, 
      included dozens of books composed by Homer and others. Some fragments of 
      this cycle are included <A HREF="#homerica">below</A>. </P>
    <P> The Illiad is based on events which probably occurred around 1000 B.C.E. 
      The Mycenean Greeks of this era were contemporaries with a Bronze age city 
      in Asia Minor on the Aegean coast of what today is Turkey. Both these cultures 
      employed megalithic architecture. Heinrich Schliemann, a German archeologist 
      in the early 20th Century, excavated both Mycenae in the Peloponessus region 
      of Greece, and another site in western Turkey which he identified as the 
      actual city of Troy. 'Troy' was destroyed (sometimes by fire) and rebuilt--not 
      once, but multiple times--and resembles closely the description of Troy 
      in the Iliad. Whether the events in the Iliad are literally true in some 
      sense is still unknown. The Odyssey, on the other hand, is pure fiction, 
      and one must strain to correlate its plot with any actual geography or history; 
      it has been called the first science fiction novel.</P>
    <P> In any case, these stories remain the most ancient European literature 
      that we have intact; because of their lively pacing and vivid characters 
      they still have strong appeal for modern readers. </P>

    <P> The following are fragments written by other authors in antiquity on the 
      subject of the Homeric epic and Homer; some of these were spuriously attributed 
      to Homer. These are remnants of a huge epic cycle which encompassed the 
      whole mythological and legendary history of the Greeks, of which the battle 
      for Troy is the centerpiece. The cycle was never completely canonized, and 
      as late as classical Roman times <A HREF="../virgil/aen/index.htm">Virgils' 
      Aeneid</A> added yet another epic poem to the collection. It seems that 
      sequels and prequels were just as popular in Ancient Greece as in modern 
      Hollywood...</P>
    <P>These are from <CITE>Hesiod, the Homeric Hymns and Homerica</CITE> by Hugh 
      G. Evelyn-White, [1914] (Loeb Classics #57). The other portions of this 
      book are presented above on this page, and in the <A HREF="../hesiod/index.htm">Hesiod
