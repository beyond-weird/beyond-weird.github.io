<P>Two little girls had led me to their home, and as soon as the door was closed they touched the wick unto the fire and wished to dance for me.</P>
<P>Their unrouged cheeks were tan, just like their little bellies. They grasped each other by the arms and chattered joyously.</P>
<P>Seated upon a raised and padded trestle, Glottis sang in a sharp voice, and struck her noisy little hands together.</P>
<P>Kyse danced in quick staccato fashion, then stopping, winded with laughter, grasped her sister by her breasts, bit her shoulder and turned her roundabout much like a playful goat.</P>
