<P>I walked through the frost-encrusted wood; my hair blossomed with tiny icicles before my mouth and my sandals were heavy with soiled and caked-up snow.</P>
<P>He said to me: "What do you seek?"--"I follow the tracks of the satyr. His little cleft foot-prints alternate like holes in a snow-white robe." He said tome: "The satyrs are dead.</P>
<P>"The satyrs, and the nymphs also. For thirty years there has not been so terrible a winter. The tracks you see are those of a goat. But stay here, here is their tomb."</P>
<P>And with the iron of his hoe he broke the ice of the spring in which the na&iuml;ads were wont to laugh of yore. He took some of the great frozen chunks, and, raising them to the pale heavens, looked through them.</P>
