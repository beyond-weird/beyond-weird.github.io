<P>Upon the soft grass, in the night, young girls with violet hair have danced together, and one of each pair gave the lover's answer.</P>
<P>The virgins said: "We are not for you." And, as though they were ashamed, they shielded their virginity. An aegipan played a flute beneath the trees.</P>
<P>The others said: "But you will come to seek us." They fashioned their dresses after the manly garb, and languidly struggled and twined their dancing limbs.</P>
<P>Then, each declaring herself to be subdued, she took her comrade by the ears, cup-fashion, and, tilting her head, she drank a lengthy kiss.</P>
