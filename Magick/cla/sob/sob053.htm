<P>I do not know if I shall mate myself with Glottis or with Kyse. As they are not much alike, one cannot soothe me for the other's loss, and greatly fear to make an evil choice.</P>
<P>Each has one of my hands, and one of my breasts too. To which I wonder shall I give my mouth? to which my heart, and all one cannot share?</P>
<P>For it is shameful to stay this way, all three within one house. They talk of such things here in Mytilene. Yesterday before the temple of Ares a passing woman did not say "Good-day"</P>
<P>'Tis Glottis I prefer; but I cannot disown Kyse. What would become of her all by herself? Or shall I leave them together as I found them, and take another lover for myself?</P>
