<P>We slipped beneath the transparent coverlet of wool, she and I. Even our heads were hidden, and the lamp lit up the cloth above us.</P>
<P>And thus I saw her dear body in a mysterious glow. We were much closer to each other, freer, more naked and more intimate. "In the selfsame shift," she said to me.</P>
<P>We left our hair done up so that we'd be more bare, and in the close air of the bed two female odors rose, as from two natural censers.</P>
<P>Nothing in the world, not even the lamp, saw us that night. And which of us was loved and which the lover, she and I alone can ever tell. But the men shall never know a thing about it.</P>
