<P>The next day I went to visit her, and we blushed the moment that we saw each other. She had me come into her private room, that we might be alone.</P>
<P>I had many things to tell her; but when I saw her I forgot them all. I did not even dare to throw myself upon her neck, I looked at her high girdle.</P>
<P>I was astonished that her face remained the same, she still seemed to be my friend; and yet, since the night before, she had learned so many things that maddened me.</P>
<P>Suddenly I sat upon her knees, I took her in my arms and whispered wildly in her ear, most anxiously. She put her cheek to mine and told me all.</P>
