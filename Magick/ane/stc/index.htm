This is an etext of L.W. Kings' authoritative work on the
Enuma Elish, the Babylonian creation myth.
This etext includes the complete introduction, and the English text of
the Enuma Elish and other related texts, with selected footnotes.
The Enuma Elish is the earliest written creation myth, in which
the God Marduk battles the chaos Goddess Tiamat and her evil minions.
The name 'Enuma Elish' is derived from the first two words of
the myth, meaning 'When in the Height'.
Tiamat takes the form of a gigantic snake, and Marduk battles
and defeats her using an arsenal of super-weapons.
After his victory Marduk is made the leader of the Gods by acclamation.
Marduk divides Tiamat's corpse into two portions,
the upper half becoming the sky and the lower half, the earth.
Marduk then creates humanity from his blood and bone.

<P>
The Enuma Elish has long been considered by scholars to
be primary source material for the book of Genesis.
It has also been hypothesized that this is a legend about
the overthrow of the matriarchy or records of some cosmic catastrophe.
