<P><A NAME="fn_175"></A><A HREF="stc12.htm#fr_175">123:1</A> For the text, see <I>Cuneiform Texts</I>, part xiii, pl. 34, D.T. 41; for a previous publication, cf. Delitzsch, <I>Assyrische Lesest&uuml;cke</I>, 3rd ed., p. 34 f.; and for previous translations, see George Smith, <I>The Chaldean Account of Genesis</I>, p. 76f., Zimmern in Gunkel's <I>Sch&ouml;pfung und Chaos</I>, and Jensen in Schrader's <I>Keilins. Bibl.</I>, vi, p. 42 f. This fragment, which George Smith suggested might be part of the Seventh Tablet of the Creation Series, does not belong to that series; it contains the introduction or opening lines of a text, and describes the creation of two small creatures by Nin-igi-azag, "The lord of clear vision." The reference to the creation of cattle and beasts of the field is merely incidental; it occurs in the long opening sentence and indicates the period at which the two small creatures were made; see further the Introduction.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_176"></A><A HREF="stc12.htm#fr_176">123:2</A> It is probable, that the second section of the text also dealt with the two small creatures whose creation is described in the first paragraph.</P>
