<P>1. When in the height heaven was not named,</P>
<P>2. And the earth beneath did not yet bear a name,</P>
<P>3. And the primeval Aps&ucirc;, who begat them,</P>
<P>4. And chaos, Tiamat, the mother of them both,--</P>
<P>5. Their waters were mingled together,</P>
<P>6. And no field was formed, no marsh was to be seen;</P>
<P>7. When of the gods none had been called into being,</P>
<P>8. And none bore a name, and no destinies [were ordained];</P>
<P>9. Then were created the gods in the midst of [heaven],</P>
<P><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></P>
<P>10. La<U>h</U>mu and La<U>h</U>amu were called into being [...].</P>
<P>11. Ages increased, [...],</P>
<P>12. Then An<U>sh</U>ar and Ki<U>sh</U>ar were created, and over them [...].</P>
<P>13. Long were the days, then there came forth [...]</P>
<P>14. Anu, their son, [...]</P>
<P>15. An<U>sh</U>ar and Anu [...]</P>
<P>16. And the god Anu [...]</P>
<P>17. Nudimmud, whom his fathers [his] begetters [...]</P>
<P>18. Abounding in all wisdom, [...]</P>
<P>19. He was exceeding strong [...]</P>
<P>20. He had no rival [...]</P>
<P>21. (Thus) were established and [were ... the great gods (?)].</P>
<P><A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A></P>
<P>22 . But T[iamat and &Acirc;ps&ucirc;] were (still) in confusion [...],</P>
<P>23. They were troubled and [...]</P>
<P>24. In disorder(?) ... [...]</P>
<P>26. And Tiamat roared [...]</P>
<P>25. Aps&ucirc; was not diminished in might [...]</P>
<P>27. She smote, and their deeds [...]</P>
<P>28. Their way was evil ... [...] ...</P>
<P>29. Then Aps&ucirc;, the begetter of the great gods,</P>
<P>30. Cried unto Mummu, his minister, and said unto him:</P>
<P>31. "O Mummu, thou minister that rejoicest my spirit,</P>
<P>32. "Come, unto Tiamat let us [go]!"</P>
<P>33. So they went and before Tiamat they lay down,</P>
<P>34. They consulted on a plan with regard to the gods [their sons].</P>
<P>35. Aps&ucirc; opened his mouth [and spake],</P>
<P><A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A></P>
<P>36. And unto Tiamat, the glistening one, he addressed [the word]:</P>
<P>37. "[...] their way [...],</P>
<P>38. "By day I cannot rest, by night [I cannot lie down (in peace)].</P>
<P>39. "But I will destroy their way, I will [...],</P>
<P>40. "Let there be lamentation, and let us lie down (again in peace)."</P>
<P>41. When Tiamat [heard] these words,</P>
<P>42. She raged and cried aloud [...].</P>
<P>43. [She ...] grievously [...],</P>
<P>44. She uttered a curse, and unto [Aps&ucirc; she spake]:</P>
<P>45. "What then shall we [do]?</P>
<P>46. "Let their way be made difficult, and let us [lie down (again) in peace]."</P>
<P>47. Mummu answered, and gave counsel unto Aps&ucirc;,</P>
<P>48. [...] and hostile (to the gods) was the counsel Mu[mmu gave]:</P>
<P><A NAME="page_11"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 11</FONT></A></P>
<P>49. "Come, their way is strong, but thou shalt destroy [it];</P>
<P>50. "Then by day shalt thou have rest, by night shalt thou lie down (in peace)."</P>
<P>51. Aps&ucirc; [hearkened unto] him and his countenance grew bright,</P>
<P>52. [Since] he (i.e. Mummu) planned evil against the gods his sons.</P>
<P>53. [...] he was afraid [...],</P>
<P>54. His knees [became weak(?)], they gave way beneath him,</P>
<P>55. [Because of the evil] which their first-born had planned.</P>
<P>56. [...] their [...] they altered(?).</P>
<P>58. Lamentation [...] they sat in [sorrow] '</P>
<P>57. [...] they [...],</P>
<P>59. [...]</P>
<P><A NAME="page_13"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 13</FONT></A></P>
<P>60. Then Ea, who knoweth all that [is], went up and he beheld their muttering.</P>
<P>61. [...]</P>
<P>62. [...] ... his pure incantation</P>
<P>63. [...] ... [...]</P>
<P>64. [...]</P>
<P>65. [...] misery</P>
<P>66. [...]</P>
<P>67. [...]</P>
<P>[Lines 68-82 are wanting.]</P>
<P>83. [...]</P>
<P>84 [...] ...</P>
<P>85. [...] the god Anu,</P>
<P>86. [... an aven]ger.</P>
<P>87. [...]</P>
<P>88. [...] and he shall confound Tiamat.</P>
<P>89. [...] he ...</P>
<P>90. [...] for ever.</P>
<P>91. [...] the evil,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_15"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 15</FONT></A></P>
<P>92. [...] ... he spake:</P>
<P>93. "[...] thy [...] he hath conquered and</P>
<P>94. " [...] he [weepeth] and sitteth in tribulation(?).</P>
<P>95. "[...] of fear,</P>
<P>96. "[...] we shall not lie down (in peace).</P>
<P>97. "[...] Aps&ucirc; is laid waste(?),</P>
<P>98. "[...] and Mummu, who were taken captive, in [...]</P>
<P>99. "[...] thou didst, ...</P>
<P>100. "[...] let us lie down (in peace).</P>
<P>101. "[...] ... they will smite (?) [...].</P>
<P>102. " [...] let us lie down (in peace).</P>
<P>103. "[...] thou shalt take vengeance for them,</P>
<P>104. "[...]unto the tempest shalt thou [...]!"</P>
<P>105. [And Tiamat hearkened unto] the word of the bright god, (and said):</P>
<P><A NAME="page_17"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 17</FONT></A></P>
<P>106. "[...] shalt thou entrust! let us wage [war]!"</P>
<P>107. [...] the gods in the midst of [...]</P>
<P>108. [...] for the gods did she create.'</P>
<P>109. [They banded themselves together and] at the side of Tiamat [they] advanced;</P>
<P>110. [They were furious, they devised mischief without resting] night and [day].</P>
<P>111. [They prepared for battle], fuming and raging;</P>
<P>112. [They joined their forces] and made war.</P>
<P>113. [Ummu-<U>H</U>ubu]r, who formed all things,</P>
<P>114. [Made in addition] weapons invincible, she spawned monster-serpents,</P>
<P>115. [Sharp of] tooth, and merciless of fang;</P>
<P>116. [With poison instead of] blood she filled [their] bodies.</P>
<P>117. Fierce [monster-vipers] she clothed with terror,</P>
<P>118. [With splendour] she decked them, [she made them] of lofty stature.</P>
<P>119. [Whoever beheld] them, terror overcame him,</P>
<P>120. Their bodies reared up and none could withstand [their attack].</P>
<P><A NAME="page_19"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 19</FONT></A></P>
<P>121. [She set] up vipers, and dragons, and the (monster) [La<U>h</U>amu],</P>
<P>122. [And hurricanes], and raging hounds, and scorpion-men,</P>
<P>123. And mighty [tempests], and fish-men, and[rams];</P>
<P>124. [They bore] cruel weapons, without fear of [the fight].</P>
<P>125. Her commands [were mighty], [none] could resist them;</P>
<P>126. After this fashion, huge of stature, [she made] eleven (monsters).</P>
<P>127. Among the gods who were her sons, inasmuch as he had given [her support],</P>
<P>128. She exalted Kingu; in their midst [she raised] him [to power].</P>
<P>129. To march before the forces, to lead [the host],</P>
<P>130. To give the battle-signal, to advance to the attack,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_21"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 21</FONT></A></P>
<P>131. To direct the battle, to control the fight,</P>
<P>132. Unto him she entrusted; in [costly raiment] she made him sit, (saying):</P>
<P>133. "I have uttered thy spell, in the assembly of the gods I have raised thee to power.</P>
<P>134. "The dominion over all the gods [have I entrusted unto him].</P>
<P>135. "Be thou exalted, thou my chosen spouse,</P>
<P>136. "May they magnify thy name over all [of them ... the Anunnaki]."</P>
<P>137. She gave him the Tablets of Destiny, on [his] breast she laid them, (saying):</P>
<P>138. "Thy command shall not be without avail, and[the word of thy mouth shall be established]."</P>
<P>139. Now Kingu, (thus) exalted, having received [the power of Anu],</P>
<P>140. [Decreed] the fate among the gods his sons, (saying):</P>
<P>141. "Let the opening of your mouth [quench] the Fire-god;</P>
<P>142. "Whoso is exalted in the battle, let him [display (his) might]!"</P>
