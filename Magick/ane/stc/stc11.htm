<P><A NAME="fn_167"></A><A HREF="stc11.htm#fr_167">117:1</A> For the text, see <I>Cuneiform Texts</I>, part xiii, pl. 33 f., Rm. 282; for a previous publication, cf. Delitzsch, <I>Assyrisches W&ouml;rterbuch</I>, p. 390 f.; translations have been given by Zimmern in Gunkel's <I>Sch&ouml;pfung und Chaos</I>, pp. 417 ff., and by Jensen in Schrader's <I>Keilins. Bibl.</I>, vi, pp. 44 ff. Strictly speaking, the text is not a creation legend, though it gives a variant form of the principal incident in the history of creation according to the version <I>Enuma eli<U>sh</I></U>. In the tablet Rm. 282 the fight with the dragon did not precede the creation of the world, but took place after men had been created and cities had been built; see further the Introduction.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_168"></A><A HREF="stc11.htm#fr_168">117:2</A> The form of the name here used is <I>T&acirc;mtu</I>, i.e., the Sea."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_169"></A><A HREF="stc11.htm#fr_169">117:3</A> The kaspu is the space that can be covered in two hours travelling, i.e., about six or seven miles. These general dimensions of the size of the dragon are in accordance with the statement made in l. 8f. of the reverse to the effect that after the dragon had been slain his blood flowed for more than three years. The. second measurement in the line is taken by Zimmern to refer to the dragon's breadth, but, as Jensen points out, this is not consistent with the measurement of the mouth given in the following line. Even Zimmern's readings of 60 <FONT SIZE=2>GAR</FONT> in l. 10 and 65 <FONT SIZE=2>GAR</FONT> in l. 11 do not explain, but render still more anomalous, the &#189; <FONT SIZE=2>GAR</FONT> in l. 9. Without going into the question of the probable length of the Babylonian cubit, it is obvious that the dragon's breadth can hardly have been given as so many miles, if its mouth only measures so many feet. This difficulty can be got over by restoring <I><U>s</U>&icirc;r&ucirc;ti<U>sh</U>u</I> in place of the suggested <I>rupussu</I> at the end of l. 8. We then have a consistent picture of the dragon as a long thin snake, rearing his head on high; his coils might well have been believed to extend for three hundred or three hundred and fifty miles, and the raising of his head in the air to a height of six or seven miles would not be inconsistent with the measurement of his mouth as six cubits, i.e., some ten feet or more across.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_170"></A><A HREF="stc11.htm#fr_170">119:1</A> Lines 17-19 are the appeal of the gods to the Moon-god; ll. 20-22 contain the address of the Moon-god to Ti<U>shh</U>u; and ll. 23 ff. give Ti<U>shh</U>u's answer to the Moon-god.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_171"></A><A HREF="stc11.htm#fr_171">119:2</A> Jensen, <I>ri-<U>h</U>u-ut</I>, which he renders as "moisture." The plural, <I>dal<U>h</U>&ucirc;ti</I>, may perhaps be explained by supposing that, according to this version also, the dragon had other creatures to help her in the fight.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_172"></A><A HREF="stc11.htm#fr_172">121:1</A> Jensen suggests the restoration <I><SUP>ilu</SUP> B</I>[<I>&ecirc;l</I>], which he deduces from the traces upon the tablet as published by Delitzsch; for, as he states, the only other restoration possible would be <I><SUP>ilu</SUP> I</I>[<I><U>sh</U>taar</I>], and this is rendered unlikely by the masculine form of the imperatives in ll. 2 and 4. This would prove that the slayer of the dragon was B&ecirc;l, or Marduk, in both the versions of the story. As a matter of fact, the traces are incorrectly given by Delitzsch; they represent the sign AN and not the conflate sign <FONT SIZE=2>AN</FONT> +<FONT SIZE=2>EN</FONT> (cf. <I>Cun. Txts</I>., pt. xiii, pl. 34), and it is not possible to conclude from the text who is the hero of this version.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_173"></A><A HREF="stc11.htm#fr_173">121:2</A> Jensen suggests the restoration <I>u</I> [ . <FONT SIZE=2>KAS-PU</FONT>], i.e., "for three years, three months, a day and [ . hours]." The trace of the next character after u is the single diagonal wedge (cf. Cun. Txts., pt. xiii, pl. 34); according to Jensen's restoration this sign can only be the number "10," i.e. X <FONT SIZE=2>KAS-PU</FONT>, "twenty hours," a not very probable reading. The diagonal wedge is more probably the beginning of the sign <FONT SIZE=2>MI</FONT>, i.e. <I>m&ucirc;<U>sh</U>u</I>, and the end of the line may be restored as <I>umu I<SUP>KAN</SUP> u</I> [<I>m&ucirc;<U>sh</U>u</I> <I>I<SUP>KAN</I></SUP>]; this may be rendered "one day and one night," or possibly, as Zimmern in his translation suggests, "day and night."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_174"></A><A HREF="stc11.htm#fr_174">121:3</A> The lower part of the tablet is taken up with the common colophon found upon tablets from A<U>sh</U>ur-bani-pal's palace.</P>
