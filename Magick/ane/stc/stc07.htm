<P>1. They prepared for him a lordly chamber,</P>
<P>2 . Before his fathers as prince he took his place.</P>
<P>3. "Thou art chiefest among the great gods,</P>
<P>4. "Thy fate is unequalled, thy word is Anu!</P>
<P>5. "O Marduk, thou art chiefest among the great gods,</P>
<P>6. "Thy fate is unequalled, thy word is Anu!</P>
<P>7. "Henceforth not without avail shall be thy command,</P>
<P>8. "In thy power shall it be to exalt and to abase.</P>
<P>9. "Established shall be the word of thy mouth, irresistible shall be thy command;</P>
<P>10. "None among the gods shall transgress thy boundary.</P>
<P>11. "Abundance, the desire of the shrines of the gods,</P>
<P>12. "Shall be established in thy sanctuary, even though they lack (offerings).</P>
<P>13. "O Marduk, thou art our avenger!</P>
<P>14. "We give thee sovereignty over the whole world.</P>
<P>15. "Sit thou down in night, be exalted in thy command.</P>
<P>16. "Thy weapon shall never lose its power, it shall crush thy foe.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A></P>
<P>17. "O lord, spare the life of him that putteth his trust in thee,</P>
<P>18. "But as for the god who began the rebellion, pour out his life."</P>
<P>19. Then set they in their midst a garment,</P>
<P>20. And unto Marduk their first-born they spake:</P>
<P>21. "May thy fate, O lord, be supreme among the gods,</P>
<P>22. "To destroy and to create; speak thou the word, and (thy command) shall be fulfilled.</P>
<P>23. "Command now and let the garment vanish;</P>
<P>24. "And speak the word again and let the garment reappear!"</P>
<P>25. Then he spake with his mouth, and the garment vanished;</P>
<P>26. Again he commanded it, and the garment reappeared.</P>
<P>27. When the gods, his fathers, beheld (the fulfilment of) his word,</P>
<P>28. They rejoiced, and they did homage (unto him, saying), " Marduk is king! "</P>
<P>29. They bestowed upon him the sceptre, and the throne, and the ring,</P>
<P>30. They give him an invincible weapon, which overwhelmeth the foe.</P>
<P>31. "Go, and cut off the life of Tiamat,</P>
<P>32. "And let the wind carry her blood into secret places."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></P>
<P>33. After the gods his fathers had decreed for the lord his fate,</P>
<P>34. They caused him to set out on a path of prosperity and success.</P>
<P>35 . He made ready the bow, he chose his weapon,</P>
<P>36. He slung a spear upon him and fastened it . . .</P>
<P>37. He raised the club, in his right hand he grasped (it),</P>
<P>38. The bow and the quiver he hung at his side.</P>
<P>39. He set the lightning in front of him,</P>
<P>40. With burning flame he filled his body.</P>
<P>41. He made a net to enclose the inward parts of Tiamat,</P>
<P>42. The four winds he stationed so that nothing of her might escape;</P>
<P>43. The South wind and the North wind and the East wind and the West wind</P>
<P>44. He brought near to the net, the gift of his father Anu.</P>
<P>45. He created the evil wind, and the tempest, and the hurricane,</P>
<P>46. And the fourfold wind, and the sevenfold wind, and the whirlwind, and the wind which had no equal;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A></P>
<P>47. He sent forth the winds which he had created, the seven of them;</P>
<P>48. T o disturb the inward parts of Tiamat, they followed after him.</P>
<P>49. Then the lord raised the thunderbolt, his mighty weapon,</P>
<P>50. He mounted the chariot, the storm unequalled for terror,</P>
<P>51. He harnessed and yoked unto it four horses,</P>
<P>52. Destructive, ferocious, overwhelming, and swift of pace;</P>
<P>53. [...] were their teeth, they were flecked with foam;</P>
<P>54. They were skilled in [...], they had been trained to trample underfoot.</P>
<P>55. [...], mighty in battle, </P>
<P>56. Left and [right ...</P>
<P>57. His garment was [...], he was clothed with terror,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A></P>
<P>58. With overpowering brightness his head was crowned.</P>
<P>59. Then he set out, he took his way,</P>
<P>60. And towards the [rag]ing Tiamat he set his face.</P>
<P>61. On his lips he held [...],</P>
<P>62. ... [...] he grasped in his hand.</P>
<P>63. Then they beheld him, the gods beheld him,</P>
<P>64. The gods his fathers beheld him, the gods beheld him.</P>
<P>65. And the lord drew nigh, he gazed upon the inward parts of Tiamat,</P>
<P>66. He perceived the muttering of Kingu, her spouse.</P>
<P>67. As (Marduk) gazed, (Kingu) was troubled in his gait,</P>
<P>68. His will was destroyed and his motions ceased.</P>
<P>69. And the gods, his helpers, who marched by his side,</P>
<P>70. Beheld their leader's [...], and their sight was troubled.</P>
<P>71. But Tiamat [...], she turned not her neck,</P>
<P>72. With lips that failed not she uttered rebellious words:</P>
<P><A NAME="page_69"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 69</FONT></A></P>
<P>73. "[...] thy coming as lord of the gods,</P>
<P>74. "From their places have they gathered, in thy place are they!"</P>
<P>75. Then the lord [raised] the thunderbolt, his mighty weapon,</P>
<P>76. [And against] Tiamat, who was raging, thus he sent (the word):</P>
<P>77. "[Thou] art become great, thou hast exalted thyself on high,</P>
<P>78. "And thy [heart hath prompted] thee to call to battle.</P>
<P>79. "[...] their fathers [...],</P>
<P>80. "[...] their [...] thou hatest [...].</P>
<P>81. "[Thou hast exalted King]u to be [thy] spouse,</P>
<P>82. "[Thou hast . . . ] him, that, even as Anu, he should issue decrees.</P>
<P>83. "[...] thou hast followed after evil,</P>
<P>84. "And [against] the .gods my fathers thou hast contrived thy wicked plan.</P>
<P>85. "Let then thy host be equipped, let thy weapons be girded on!</P>
<P>86. "Stand! I and thou, let us join battle!"</P>
<P><A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A></P>
<P>87. When Tiamat heard these words,</P>
<P>88. She was like one possessed, she lost her reason.</P>
<P>89. Tiamat uttered wild, piercing cries,</P>
<P>90. She trembled and shook to her very foundations.</P>
<P>91. She recited an incantation, she pronounced her spell,</P>
<P>92. And the gods of the battle cried out for their weapons.</P>
<P>93. Then advanced Tiamat and Marduk, the counsellor of the gods;</P>
<P>94. To the fight they came on, to the battle they drew nigh.</P>
<P>95. The lord spread out his net and caught her,</P>
<P>96. And the evil wind that was behind (him) he let loose in her face.</P>
<P>97. As Tiamat opened her mouth to its full extent,</P>
<P>98. He drove in the evil wind, while as yet she had not shut her lips.</P>
<P>99. The terrible winds filled her belly,</P>
<P>100. And her courage was taken from her, and her mouth she opened wide.</P>
<P>101. He seized the spear and burst her belly,</P>
<P>102. He severed her inward parts, he pierced (her) heart.</P>
<P>103. He overcame her and cut off her life;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></P>
<P>104. He cast down her body and stood upon it.</P>
<P>105. When he had slain Tiamat, the leader,</P>
<P>106. Her might was broken, her host was scattered.</P>
<P>107. And the gods her helpers, who marched by her side,</P>
<P>108. Trembled, and were afraid, and turned back.</P>
<P>109. They took to flight to save their lives;</P>
<P>110. But they were surrounded, so that they could not escape.</P>
<P>111. He took them captive, he broke their weapons;</P>
<P>112. In the net they were caught and in the snare they sat down.</P>
<P>113. The [...] ... of the world they filled with cries of grief.</P>
<P>114. They received punishment from him, they were held in bondage.</P>
<P>115. And on the eleven creatures which she had filled with the power of striking terror,</P>
<P>116. Upon the troop of devils, who marched at her [...],</P>
<P>117. He brought affliction, their strength [he ...];</P>
<P>118. Them and their opposition he trampled under his feet.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A></P>
<P>119. Moreover, Kingu, who had been exalted over them,</P>
<P>120. He conquered, and with the god Dug-ga he counted him.</P>
<P>121. He took from him the Tablets of Destiny that were not rightly his,</P>
<P>122. He sealed them with a seal and in his own breast he laid them.</P>
<P>123. Now after the hero Marduk had conquered and cast down his enemies,</P>
<P>124. And had made the arrogant foe even like ...,</P>
<P>125. And had fully established An<U>sh</U>ar's triumph over the enemy,</P>
<P>126. And had attained the purpose of Nudimmud,</P>
<P>127. Over the captive gods he strengthened his durance,</P>
<P>128. And unto Tiamat, whom he had conquered, he returned.</P>
<P>129. And the lord stood upon Tiamat's hinder parts,</P>
<P>130. And with his merciless club he smashed her skull.</P>
<P>131. He cut through the channels of her blood,</P>
<P>132. And he made the North wind bear it away into secret places.</P>
<P>133. His fathers beheld, and they rejoiced and were glad;</P>
<P><A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></P>
<P>134. Presents and gifts they brought unto him.</P>
<P>135. Then the lord rested, gazing upon her dead body,</P>
<P>136. While he divided the flesh of the ..., and devised a cunning plan.</P>
<P>137. He split her up like a flat fish into two halves;</P>
<P>138. One half of her he stablished as a covering for heaven.</P>
<P>139. He fixed a bolt, he stationed a watchman,</P>
<P>140. And bade them not to let her waters come forth.</P>
<P>141. He passed through the heavens, he surveyed the regions (thereof),</P>
<P>142. And over against the Deep he set the dwelling of Nudimmud.</P>
<P>143. And the lord measured the structure of the Deep,</P>
<P>144. And he founded E-<U>sh</U>ara, a mansion like unto it.</P>
<P>145. The mansion E-<U>sh</U>ara which he created as heaven,</P>
<P>146. He caused Anu, B&ecirc;l, and Ea in their districts to inhabit.</P>
