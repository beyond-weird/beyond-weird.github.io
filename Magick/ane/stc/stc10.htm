<P><A NAME="fn_157"></A><A HREF="stc10.htm#fr_157">93:1</A> The title Tutu is there explained as <I>ba-a-nu</I>, " creator," while its two component parts (<FONT SIZE=2>TU</FONT> + <FONT SIZE=2>TU</FONT>) occur in the Sumerian version of the line as the equivalents of <I>la-nu-u</I> and <I>e-di-<U>sh</U>u</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_158"></A><A HREF="stc10.htm#fr_158">97:1</A> The text of the commentary read <I>mu-kin</I>, i.e. "the Founder of Purification"; for other variant readings in the line, see Appendix I.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_159"></A><A HREF="stc10.htm#fr_159">99:1</A> Literally, "the black-headed ones."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_160"></A><A HREF="stc10.htm#fr_160">103:1</A> In the margin of the fragment K. 13,761 every tenth line is indicated by the figure "10."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_161"></A><A HREF="stc10.htm#fr_161">105:1</A> The word <I>durma<U>h</U>u</I> was employed as a Babylonian priestly title. It may here be rendered by some such general phrase as "ruler," unless it is to be taken as a proper name.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_162"></A><A HREF="stc10.htm#fr_162">107:1</A> ... The expression <I>r&ecirc;<U>sh</U>u-ark&acirc;t</I>, literally "the beginning--the future," may be taken as implying Marduk's complete control over the world, both at its creation and during its subsequent existence. It is possible that <I>s'u-nu</I> is the pronominal suffix and should be attached to the preceding word, i.e. r&ecirc;<U>sh</U>-ark&acirc;tu-<U>sh</U>u-nu, "their beginning and future," that is, "the beginning and future of mankind."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_163"></A><A HREF="stc10.htm#fr_163">107:2</A> I.e., mankind.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_164"></A><A HREF="stc10.htm#fr_164">111:1</A> From the commentary R. 366, etc., and the explanatory text S. 747, it may be concluded that the Seventh Tablet, in its original form, ended at 1. 124. It is probable that ll. 125-142 were added as an epilogue at the time when the composition was incorporated in the Creation Series (see Appendix I).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_165"></A><A HREF="stc10.htm#fr_165">111:2</A> I.e., the names of Marduk.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_166"></A><A HREF="stc10.htm#fr_166">115:1</A> This is probably the last line of the tablet. It may here be noted that, for the text of the Seventh Tablet given in the preceding pages, only those fragments have been used which are proved by the commentaries to contain missing portions of the text. Several other fragments, which from their contents and style of writing may possibly belong to copies of the text, have not been. included. The text of one such fragment (S. 2,013) is of peculiar interest and is given in Appendix II; in l. 10 f. it refers to <I>Ti-amat e-li-ti</I> and <I>Ti-amat <U>sh</U>ap-li-ti</I>, "The Ocean (Tiamat) which is above" and "The Ocean (Tiamat) which is beneath," a close parallel to "the waters which were above the firmament" and "the waters which were under the firmament" of Gen. i, 7; see the Introduction.</P>
