<P>2. The stars, their images, as the stars of the Zodiac, he fixed.</P>
<P>3. He ordained the year and into sections he divided it;</P>
<P>4. For the twelve months he fixed three stars.</P>
<P>5. After he had [...] the days of the year [...] images,</P>
<P>6. He founded the station of Nibir&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>to determine their bounds;</P>

<P>10. He made strong the bolt on the left and on the right.</P>

<P>13. He appointed him, a being of the night, to determine the days;</P>
