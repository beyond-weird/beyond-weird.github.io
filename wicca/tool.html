CONSECRATION OF CHALICE, ATHAME OR OTHER TOOL:

Before these assembled spirits I bring (name type of tool) to be dedicated to
the service of the Lady and Lord.

(Pass tool three times through smoke of the incense.)

By the power of air, be thou purified.  Be thou dedicated to purity of thought
and to harmlessness that all intentions for which thou art used may harm none
and be for the good of all.

(Pass tool three times through or over the flame of the fire candle.)

By the power of fire, be thou purified.  Be thou dedicated to purity of
desire, and to harmlessness that all goals which thou art doest help achieve
may harm none and be for the good of all.

(Take a few drops of water and sprinkle or dab on instrument.)

By the power of water, be thou purified.  Be thou dedicated to purity of
emotion, and to harmlessness that all that thou shalt be used in a spirit of
harmony, harming none and for the good of all.

(Touch instrument to the stone or salt in north quarter)

By the power of earth, be thou purified.  Be thou dedicated to steadfastness
and purity of purpose, that my will be achieved without wavering, with harm to
none and for the good of all.

(If this is a chalice, present it first to the Lady, then to the Lord, if
athame, reverse order.  All other instruments use personal preference, but it
is courtesy to present them to Her first.)

PRESENTATION FOR CHALICE:

Lady Freya, Keeper of Femininity, bless this chalice.  Let it be as Thy
cauldron, a vessel of productivity that it may be worThy to dispense Thy
bounty.  Let it be used in Thy service and in the service of humanity.  Let it
be so bound that no harm may come of it to any being, but let it rather be an
instrument of good-will and understanding; of loving harmony.  To Thy sacred
self I dedicate this vessel, (name of vessel), that it and I may long be of
service to Thee.

Lord Thor, companion to the Lady, champion of the Gods, bless this chalice and
keep watch over it.  Guard the works which come forth from it, that they ever
be in the service of Thee and Thy Lady, that they be of service to humankind,
and that they abide by the laws of harmony.  To Thee I vow I shall use it for
Her sacred purposes, and for no other.

So mote it be.

PRESENTATION FOR ATHAME:

Lord Thor, thunderer & hammer wielder, bless this athame.  Let it be as the
spring rains which fall upon the earth to cause Her to bring forth Her bounty.
Let it quicken my hopes and dreams, yet keep them from causing harm.  Let it
guide them in the harmony of the seasons, bringing forth only good for all.
Lord Thor, bless this athame, (name of athame), that it be used ever in the
worship and honor of the Gods.

Lady Freya, companion to the Thunderer, lover of the Gods, bless this athame
that it shall bring forth joy, and shall cause no pain nor disharmony to any.
I dedicate this athame (name athame), symbol of the Defender and Rain Maker,
to Thy service.  May it ever bring Thee joy and pride.

So mote it be.

(This ritual, with suitable changes, may be used to dedicate other tools as
well as these.)
