    Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand 

    once I talked to a great Grey Man 

    spun three times and said with a sigh 

    "Hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!" 

 

 Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day 

        hi diddle i diddle i diddle ay 

        hi di diddle i diddle i day 

        fol the dink a dum diddle do di day 

 

    Hi said the Lady, dressed in green 

    prettiest thing I've ever seen 

    she went down underneath the hill 

    and came back out of her own free will 

 

    Brian Boru, on Irish ground 

    walked three times the Island round 

    Norsemen came lookin for a fight 

    just another Irish Saturday night! 

 

    Hi said Lugh on the banquest night 

    a poet and a player and a good wheelwright 

    a harper and a warrior and none the least: 

    a Druid and he got in to the Feast! 

 

    Harold Haardrada's face was red! 

    Came to Britain and he wound up dead 

    Stamford Bridge is where he's found 

    got six feet of English ground 

 

    the Legion with it's Eagles bright 

    marched into the Pictish night 

    met them there upon the sand 

    gave em up to the Wicker Man! 

 

    eight-legged steed and hound of Hel 

    the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well 

    fire burn and fire spark 

    are you then feared of the dark? 

 

    The Circle forms, the Circle flows 

    the Circle goes where no man knows 

    Hail to the Lady, one in three: 

    Present is Past and Past is Me! 

 

    Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight 

    all thru the Day all thru the Night 

    Hail to the Lady, one in Three 

    Present is Past and Past is Thee! 

 

    Hi said the Lady dressed in white 

    sang the Day and sang the Night 

    sang the Land and sang the Sea 

    sang the Song, and then sang Me!    (extra verses:) 

 

    Salt and oil and mirror bright 

    fire and fleet and candlelight 

    by fin and feather, leaf and tree, 

    fill the cup and blessed be! 

 

    From the misty crystal sea 

    came the Lady to the lea 

    Sword and Roses in Her Hand 

    spread their seeds thruout the Land 

 

    Came the Stag from oaken wood 

    saw the Lady where she stood 

    by the fire burning bright 

    came to know his heart's delight!    (end of extra verses) 

 

    By Sword and Harp, and Irish Hound 

    Blessed Be: the Day I've found 

    Hail to the Lady, one in Three 

    Present is Past and Past is WE 

 

    By Oak and Ash and Holy Thorn 

    blessed be the Day you're born! 

    Fire burn and fire bright 

    walk in safety thru the night 

 

                             * end *
