                        YOU
                          -the Whyte Bard

  You are a Child of the Goddess, a daughter or a son of the God,
  and you are here in joy. Live your life to its fullest, taking
  the good with the bad and learning from each.

  Enjoy love, giving yourself to your lover as you will, but not
  so much that you lose your Self, and take that which is given by
  your lover, but not so much as to empty them of Selfhood. You
  are both individuals who are walking together, side by side, in
  equal partnership, and if your paths should separate, then so
  be it. Separate in joy, not hate.

  Love. Love life, love your fellow humans, and love our Brothers
  and Sisters in fur, feather and scale. Love your Mother Earth.
  We are caretakers of the planet; this is our Home.

  Work. Do not live from the bounty of others, but live of your
  own, as an independent member of the whole. If you must take
  charity, take it in good grace, and return what you have been
  loaned therefrom when you can, be it in kind, or by whatever
  means you have.

  Give. Give to those in need, and to those that hunger or thirst.
  Give not to inflate yourself, and to show others your magniminity,
  but give from a love for your fellow humans. Give of your substance,
  but more importantly, give a helping hand, that the person helped
  may support themselves, free from obligation.

  Teach. Teach your children and teach others, not by words, for
  words can twist and lie, but by your own example. Teach Kindness,
  and Understanding, and Joy, but most of all, teach Love. If you
  must discipline your children, discipline in love, not anger.

  Think. Think before you speak. Think before you act. Consider your
  words and actions, and the effect they will have on others.

  Learn. Learn from all, for even a fool may speak wisdom unknowingly.
  Most of all, learn thru the wide eyes of a Child, seeing for the
  first time.

  Ask. If you do not know, ask. If you are unsure, ask. If you are
  sure...ask again.

  Speak the Truth. Live the Truth. Love the Truth. Seek after the
  Truth.

  Harm none. Love all. For it is written, and it is undoubtedly so,
  that what you have done to the least and smallest, you have done
  to the Deity.
