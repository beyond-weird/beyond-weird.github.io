The athame is used in Magick, as I use it, to represent the element of fire 
and the direction  of the south.  In the circle the athame is used to cast the 
circle and to charge the contents of the chalice in the central rite of all 
Wicca, the SYMBOLIC joining of the Lord and the Lady in LOVE.  It is also used 
to banish any imbalanced, excess positive or negative energies that are 
harmful to us - in whatever form these may take.  IT IS NOT USED FOR MUNDANE 
TASKS such as inscribing candles or slicing the "cake" for cakes and wine.  A 
simple, white-handled knife is kept for that usage.

The athame is usually replaced, as soon as possible, by a sword for coven 
work.  This sword should be worked on by the group in the same way that the 
athame is by the individual, as it is a channel of the group's energy.  The 
sword should, therefore, be taken special care of.  Swords are expensive and 
someone NOT connected with Wicca might be tempted to purloin it and try to 
resell it.   If the coven has a sword, it is put in the care of the High 
Priestess and High Priest and they would be wise to keep it in a locked 
closet, if at all possible.  It symbolizes the energies of the group psyche 
that has been formed or is being formed, as well as the group's magickal 
power.

If the Coven should seperate, it has been traditionally left to the Highest 
ranking individual in the Coven, which should be the High Priest and/or High 
Priestess.  Even though the coven has paid for it and worked on it, the High 
Priesthood retains it as a symbol of the circle's GRATITUDE for the teaching 
they have recieved from them.  It can be cleansed by the Leaders and used in 
further covens they may sponsor in their travels - and often each new group 
chooses some symbol or something they can add to it.
