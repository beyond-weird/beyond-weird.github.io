Everyone, if you could bear with me a bit...
I found this poem (I'm not saying where) and I would like your  opinion of
it. I am not sure if I am posting in the right place but
I am sure I will find out (grin)

Again the burning came,
She felt the heat, the searing pain
a cry lanced through her heart
   "Why, My Lady, Why"

She lay quietly, remembering
lost within the labrynth of the past
and the future
she did not feel the bite of the cruel blade.

Bleeding, moaning, she saw the man
his face, and heart masked with black
she knew his choices and his pain
Oh, to cause pain, to accept his own
if only she could Touch him, Heal him.

"I love you" she whispered
dark eyes calm, yet full of pain
"Don't " cried the man "I want to see you die"
"I love you and forgive you" she said
tears rolled freely down her cheeks

Again, and again the searing pain
As the man applied the red hot blade
"Do you still love me, and forgive me" he screamed?

Despite the pain she answered strongly
"I do", She smiled
"Blessed be" she whispered.

A wave of pain sent her among the stars.
"My Lady" she cried "I'm frightened"
Strong arms held her close
"You have done well my child, rest now"

The man watched as the blade grew cold
As the young body before him cooled
tears streamed down his face
and he whispered
    "Forgive me"
