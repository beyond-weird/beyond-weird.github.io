                       A Pledge to Pagan Spirituality



     I am  a Pagan and I dedicate Myself to channeling the Spiritual Energy
     of my Inner Self to help and to heal myself and others.


  *  I know  that I  am a  part of  the Whole  of Nature.   May I  grow  in
     understanding of  the Unity  of all  Nature.  May  I  always  walk  in
     Balance.

  *  May I  always be  mindful of  the diversity  of  Nature as well as its
     Unity and  may I  always be  tolerant of those whose race, appearance,
     sex, sexual preference, culture, and other ways differ from my own.

  *  May I  use the  Force (psychic  power) wisely  and  never  use it  for
     aggression nor  for malevolent  purposes. May  I never  direct  it  to
     curtail the free will of another.

  *  May I  always be mindful that I create my own reality and that I have
     the power within me to create positivity in my life.

  *  May I  always act  in  honorable  ways: being  honest with  myself and
     others, keeping  my word  whenever I  have given  it,  fulfilling  all
     responsibilities and  commitments I  have taken  on to  the best of my
     ability.

  *  May I  always  remember  that whatever  is  sent  out  always  returns
     magnified to  the sender.  May the  Forces of  Karma move  swiftly  to
     remind me  of these  spiritual commitments when I have begin to falter
     from them,  and may I use this Karmic feedback to help myself grow and
     be more attuned to my Inner Pagan Spirit.

  *  May I always remain strong and committed to my Spiritual ideals in the
     face of  adversity and  negativity. May  the Force  of my Inner Spirit
     ground out  all malevolence  directed my  way and  transform  it  into
     positivity. May  my Inner  Light shine  so  strongly  that  malevolent
     forces can not even approach my sphere of existence.

  *  May I  always grow  in Inner  Wisdom & Understanding.  May I see every
     problem that  I face  as an opportunity  to develop myself spiritually
     in solving it.

  *  May I always act out of Love to all other beings on this  Planet -- to
     other humans,  to plants,  to animals,  to minerals, to elementals, to
     spirits, and to other entities.

  *  May I  always be  mindful that the  Goddess and God in all their forms
     dwell within  me and  that this  divinity is  reflected through my own
     Inner Self, my Pagan Spirit.

  *  May I  always channel  Love and  Light from  my  being.  May my  Inner
     Spirit, rather  than my ego self, guide all my thoughts, feelings, and
     actions.

                      SO MOTE IT BE
