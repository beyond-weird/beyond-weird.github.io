<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> From 1947 until 17 December 1969, the United States 
  Air Force actively investigated reports and sightings of unidentified flying 
  objects - UFOs, under a program called Project Blue Book. The project which 
  was headquartered at Wright-Patterson AFB, was terminated in December of 1969 
  after 22 years. US Air Force Secretary Robert C. Seamans, Jr., terminated the 
  project because the US Air Force could no longer justify the project for national 
  security reasons or scientific study. After closing Project Blue Book the US 
  Air Force has not publicly acknowledged any further interest in UFO sightings.

  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF"> No UFO reported, investigated and evaluated by the 
    Air Force was ever an indication of threat to our national security. </font> 
    <P> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF"> There was no evidence submitted to or discovered 
    by the Air Force that sightings categorized as "unidentified" represented 
    technological developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific 
    knowledge. </font> 
    <P> 
  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF"> There was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized 
    as "unidentified" were extra-terrestrial vehicles. </font>

  were the result of:</B> </font>

  <LI><font color="#FFFFFF"> A mild form of mass hysteria. </font> 
    <P>

    a hoax or seek publicity. </font> 
    <P>

</UL>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Project Blue Book investigated 12,618 UFO sightings 
  and 701 of those sightings remained unidentified. Many UFO researchers feel 
  that the investigations of the UFO sightings were unprofessional and unscientific. 
  The program used poor research methods and researchers were too eager to label 
  a mysterious sighting as "identified" phenomena. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Individual researchers and UFO organisations believe 
  that members of Project Blue Book were pressured to "identify" UFO sightings 
  to calm the public hysteria about UFOs. This theory has been supported by the 
  recent release of CIA documents pertaining to UFOs. They also suggest that any 
  report that was initially perceived as unexplainable or would cause public concern 
  was never included in Project Blue Book. They allege that these reports were 
  passed on to a higher authority that never reported the results to the public.

<P><font color="#000000" face="VERDANA,ARIAL" size="2"> <font color="#FFFFFF">Project 
  Blue Book, it seems, was just a low level collection and disinformation program 
  created under Project Sign (of December 1947) which evolved into Project Grudge 
  (of December 1948) to cover up the true investigation into the alien presence 
  on Earth</font></font>
