<p align="center"><b>FOREWORD</b></p>

<p>The Purpose of this little volume is three-fold. (1) To give
those who are interested in the art of Crystal-Gazing a clear and
concise method of procedure, not alone in the practice of the
work, but also in the preparation of the crystal itself, so that
it becomes a true material basis or link with other planes. (2)
To show that the Ancient Methods of Working -- if properly
understood -- are more scientific than modern ones, since they
were designed to insure a definite type of vision and to put the
Seer in touch with definite Intelligences of a Higher Order. (3)
To point out that there are other Crystalline Spheres besides the
crystal ball at first used to contact them; and that eventually
the practice may lead to very high results, if the necessary
steps are taken to insure success.</p>

<p>With these objects in mind, the Author has done all in his
power to make this book of real value to all who may obtain it.</p>

<p>In the hands of the beginner it may lead to a wider conception
of the Nature and Powers of his, or her, own being. Those who
have already traveled some distance along the Occult Path may
still find help through the study of the more advanced, if less
understood, methods of the Ancient Seers. Those who are seeking
to make their own Vision more Perfect, so that the Light of Truth
may focus itself within them, will also find hints as to the
means of accomplishing their True Purpose.</p>

<p>Thus, it is hoped, all will be satisfied; and should their
satisfaction be equal to that of the Author at this opportunity
to herald the Light -- however faintly -- of the Ultimate
Crystalline Sphere, Whose nature is Light Itself, he will be more
than repaid for his efforts.</p>
