<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Consecration of Chalice, Athame or Other Tool</H1>

<P>Before these assembled spirits I bring (name type of tool) to be dedicated to the service of 
the Lady and Lord.</P>

<P>(<I>Pass tool three times through smoke of the incense.</I>)</P>

<P>By the power of air, be thou purified. Be thou dedicated to purity of thought and to 
harmlessness that all intentions for which thou art used may harm none and be for the good of 
all.</P>

<P>(<I>Pass tool three times through or over the flame of the fire candle.</I>)</P>

<P>By the power of fire, be thou purified. Be thou dedicated to purity of desire and to 
harmlessness that all goals which thou doest help achieve may harm none and be for the good of 
all.</P>

<P>(<I>Take a few drops of water and sprinkle or dab on instrument.</I>)</P>

<P>By the power of water, be thou purified. Be thou dedicated to purity of emotion and to 
harmlessness that all that thou shalt be used in a spirit of harmony, harming none and for the 
good of all.</P>

<P>(<I>Touch instrument to the stone or salt in north quarter</I>)</P>

<P>By the power of earth, be thou purified. Be thou dedicated to steadfastness and purity of 
purpose, that my will be achieved without wavering, with harm to none and for the good of all.</P>

<P>(<I>If this is a chalice, present it first to the Lady, then to the Lord, if athame, reverse 
order. All other instruments use personal preference, but it is courtesy to present them to Her 
first.</I>)</P>

<H3>PRESENTATION FOR CHALICE:</H3>

<P>Lady Freya, Keeper of Femininity, bless this chalice. Let it be as Thy cauldron, a vessel of 
productivity that it may be worthy to dispense Thy bounty. Let it be used in Thy service and in 
the service of humanity. Let it be so bound that no harm may come of it to any being, but let it 
rather be an instrument of goodwill and understanding; of loving harmony. To Thy sacred self I 
dedicate this vessel, (name of vessel), that it and I may long be of service to Thee.</P>

<P>Lord Thor, companion to the Lady, champion of the Gods, bless this chalice and keep watch 
over it. Guard the works which come forth from it, that they ever be in the service of Thee and 
Thy Lady, that they be of service to humankind, and that they abide by the laws of harmony. To 
Thee I vow I shall use it for Her sacred purposes, and for no other.<BR>
<CENTER>So mote it be.</CENTER></P>

<H3>PRESENTATION FOR ATHAME:</H3>

<P>Lord Thor, thunderer &amp; hammer wielder, bless this athame. Let it be as the spring rains 
which fall upon the Earth to cause Her to bring forth Her bounty.</P>

<P>Let it quicken my hopes and dreams, yet keep them from causing harm. Let it guide them in the 
harmony of the seasons, bringing forth only good for all. Lord Thor, bless this athame, (name of 
athame), that it be used ever in the worship and honor of the Gods.</P>

<P>Lady Freya, companion to the Thunderer, lover of the Gods, bless this athame that it shall 
bring forth joy, and shall cause no pain nor disharmony to any. I dedicate this athame (name 
athame), symbol of the Defender and Rain Maker, to Thy service. May it ever bring Thee joy and 
pride.<BR>
<CENTER>So mote it be.</CENTER></P>

<P>(<I>This ritual, with suitable changes, may be used to dedicate other tools as well as these.</I>)</P>
