     The  following is the comparison listing of Christianity and Wicca that
     I mentioned in a previous  message. It was prepared by  Kerr Cuchulain,
     who is  the Canadian  Chapter Head  for the  Witches League for  Public
     Awareness,  in  response to  a request  from  a Christian  minister who
     contacted the League.

     10 Commandments                       Wiccan Rede Harm none 
     Psychic phenomena generally           Psychic abilities encouraged 
     discouraged except for                (magick) 
     &quot;miracles&quot; 
     * Names vary from tradition to tradition. lDifferent aspects of the 
     Goddess/God have different names creating the impression that Wicca may
     be pantheistic. 
     ** Wiccans  use a book called the &quot;Book of  Shadows&quot;. This is a working
     notebook rather than a scriptural text.
