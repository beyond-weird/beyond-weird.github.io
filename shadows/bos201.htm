                                    MAY DAY CHANT  ONE 
           
               Here we come apiping, 
               In Springtime and in May; 
               Green fruit aripening, 
               And Winter fled away. 
               The Queen she sits upon the strand, 
               Fair as lily, white as wand; 
               Seven billows on the sea, 
               Horses riding fast and free, 
               And bells beyond the sand. 
           
          Valiente, Doreen; &quot;Witchcraft for Tomorrow&quot;; Phoenix Publishing 1985 
           
           
                                    MAY DAY CHANT  Two 
           
          The  High  Priestess and  High Priest  lead  a ring  dance  around the
          bonfire. Start out with &quot;A Tree Song&quot; from Rudyard Kipling's &quot;Weland's
          Sword&quot; story in &quot;Puck of Pook's Hill&quot;.   
           
               &quot;Oh, do not tell the Priest of our Art, 
               Or he would call it sin; 
               But we shall be out in the woods all night, 
               A conjuring summer in! 
               And we bring you news by word of mouth 
               For women, cattle and corn 
               Now is the dun come up from the South 
               With Oak, and Ash and Thorn!&quot; 
           
           
          Farrar, Janet and Stewart; &quot;Eight Sabbats For Witches&quot;; Robert   Hale
          1983 
           
           
                              STAG CALL also MAYCHANT THREE 
           
          The  men gather around the fire, next  to their partners, and they say
          in unison: 
           
               &quot;I am the stag of seven tines; 
               I am a wide flood on the plain; 
               I am a wind on the deep waters; 
               I am a shining tear of the sun; 
               I am a hawk on a cliff; 
               I am fair among flowers; 
               I am a god who sets the head afire with smoke.&quot; 
           
          Graves, Robert; &quot;The White Goddess&quot;; Farrar 1970
