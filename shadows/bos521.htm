                  SHE MOVED THRU THE FAIRE
                              -Padraic Colum
                  recorded by Theodore Bikel
                                        
   My young love said to me: My mother won't mind
   And my father won't slight you for your lack of kind
   She put her arms 'round me; these words she did say:
   It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day!
                                        
   Then she stepped away from me, and she moved thru the Faire
   And so fondly I watched her move here and move there
   At last she turned homeward, with one star awake
   As the Swan in the evening moves over the lake.
                                        
   Last night she came to me, my dead love came in
   And so soft did she move that her feet made no din
   She put her arms 'round me; these words she did say:
   It will not be long, love, 'til our wedding day!
                                        
                          *             
                                                                            2312
