                              Balance of the God and Goddess 
                                         Adrienne

          I  see the God  as That is  Created and Destroyed; the  Goddess is the
          Creator and the Destroyer.   His knowledge is experiential and he sees
          the cycle  of rebirth from  the unique  perspective of the  being that
          experiences  it. He  understands, more  so than  the Goddess,  how the
          cycle shapes the world of the living.  His life cycle of birth to full
          power  to age  to death  to rebirth  parallels our  own lives  on this
          earth.    The Goddess  loves Her  children,  the God  understands His.
          Through the  love they bear  for each  other, they share  in both  the
          knowledge  of  the  mystery of  rebirth  and  in  the  power, but  the
          knowledge remains His province and the power rests in Her.
