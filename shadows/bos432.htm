                                The Charge of The God
                                (c) 1986, Kyri Comyn

               &quot;I am the strength of the rock at thy back, the roots of the
          tree that anchor the Earth and deepest of tides in the black
          depths of the ocean.  I am the Hunter and the Sacred Prey, the
          warmth of the sun in the swelling grapes and the call of the road
          that leads over the hill.

               I give you, my creatures, the fire of love, the power of the
          wind on your face, shelter from the darkest storm.  You are dear
          to me, and I instill in you my power...the power of peace hard
          earned, the power of vision and magical sight, and the spark of
          elemental fire, which is the primal light in the darkness.

               By the powers of running stag and glorious sun, I charge
          thee;  by the darkest depth of night and the lingering tendrils
          of dreams, I charge thee; and by the beauty of your own creation,
          I charge thee;

               Follow your heart and your instinct, wherever they lead
               you.  The wealth of the heart will guide you where the
               cold edge of logic cannot take you.

               Take joy in the powers of your bodies.  The form your
               body takes is unique in the universe and is chief among
               your tools.

               Lastly, always remember the path you have left behind
               you.  Learn to take your power from the foolish things
               you have wrought as well as the good you have done for
               others and for your world.  You can never usurp
               another's power, and yours is the well upon which you
               must rely.

               I am with you always, just over your shoulder, running with
          you through the tall grasses and forests that surround you.  I
          possess you and I am your Sacred Prey.  I am the Lord of Death,
          and when you have come to the end of your life on this world, I
          will be there; to take you between the worlds, to offer you peace
          and rest.  Look upon my face; know me.  I am the spirit of the
          wild things, but you too, are wild in your souls and we are
          forever intertwined.&quot;


















                                           1926
