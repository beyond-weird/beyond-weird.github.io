                          Prayers to Brighid 
These are some prayers to Brighid that I adapted from prayers to the
Irish Saint Brigid.  Comments are welcome.

&quot;KINDLING THE FIRE&quot;

This morning, as I kindle the flame upon my hearth, I pray that the
flame of Brighid may burn in my soul, and the souls of all I meet today.

I pray that no envy and malice, no hatred or fear, may smother the
flame.

I pray that indifference and apathy, comtempt and pride, may not pour
like cold water on the flame.

Instead, may the spark of Brighid light the love in my soul, that it may
burn brightly through the day.

And may I warm those that are lonely, whose hearts are cold and
lifeless, so that all may know the comfort of Brighid's love.


&quot;COVERING THE FIRE&quot;

Brighid, preserve the fire, as You preserve us all.

Brighid, may its warmth remain in our midst, as You are always among us.

Brighid, may it rise to life in the morning, as You raise us to life.
