                                     Rebirth 
        &quot;It is time for you to go now.&quot;
        The Lady spoke to him in a sweet voice.
        &quot;So soon?&quot; he answered, &quot;It seems as if I just arrived.&quot;
        &quot;It always does,&quot; she smiled, &quot;But it's time to move on to another
life and another body. You'll like this one.&quot;
        &quot;I hope so. Buchenwald was not pleasant....&quot;
        &quot;No, it isn't. But, like you folks say, 'that's Life!'&quot;
        He laughed, and stood up on the so-green grass.
        &quot;Yeah, I guess it is. See you in a while, folks.&quot;
        The Circle of friends waved at him, wishing him luck and good
fortune, and he and the Lady moved off into a misty area.
        &quot;Pretty foggy here,&quot; he remarked.
        &quot;It will clear up soon,&quot; she said, and she took his hand.
        They walked for a long time, until he saw they were on a quiet
street in a small town. It looked like a nice place. Around the corner was a
park, and in it, two people, a man and a woman, were sitting on a bench,
holding hands. They were deeply in love, and that love shone around them to
those with eyes to see.
        &quot;These are your parents. They're nobody special, but they're nice
people and you'll like them,&quot; She said.
        &quot;They look like nice folks,&quot; he replied. &quot;Anything I need to know
before I do this?&quot;
        &quot;I'm afraid I can't tell you. Life is one of those things that you
just have to experience on your own.&quot;
        &quot;OK,&quot; he said, &quot;I guess You're right, all things considered.&quot;
        The Lady laughed, and touched him on the forehead.
        &quot;Now forget, for a time, until you return to Me.&quot;
        And he did.
