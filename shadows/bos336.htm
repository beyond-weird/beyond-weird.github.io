                Theforegoing was delivered on July 20, 1989, through the trance-
          mediumship  of  Carla Neff  Gordan by  the  Spirit Guide  &quot;Mary.&quot; Mary
          stated that these ideas will also be released through other mediums in
          six different areas of  the world. In preface to  these &quot;Commandments&quot;
          Mary said the following:

                &quot;Youare a loving,connected community oflike-minded souls assist-
          ing  through our inner connection. You are becoming a profound  source
          of awakening for  your world. These rules are to  open your hearts, to
          teach  you self-love,  to calm  your emotion  to help  you to  live in
          reality that you have wished. To grow, first you must  become a source
          of  service. There  must  be a  difference in  earth because  you have
          walked  here. Now is  the time of  shifting your energy  into a higher
          place through  unconditional love. A part  of your purpose  is to heal
          the earth  through holy, or  wholeness, relationships. You  will begin
          now.&quot;

            


                                                                            1723
