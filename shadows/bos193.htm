                                     destroy the False Ones who
                                     had exalted themselves and
                                     deceived some Mayas to
                                     worship them; and defeated
                                     the Lords of Death.

                               who are the Rain Gods.  They

                         the essence of Strenght (warrior-type
                         strenght).  He is considered a Great
                         Breast.  All His Priests and Priestesses
                         are His harlots.

      22  -  Itzam Na  -  as Great God who oversees Justice
                          between the Gods and the Mayan who
                          worships the Gods.
      


      23  -  Ku Kulcan  -  The Aztecs called Him &quot;Quetzalcoatl&quot;. 
                          He is the God of Self-sacrifice which
                          was done so the Maya could survive
                          and gain acknowledgement of Itzam Na.
                          Some myths place Him as the Judge of
                          the dead (but I would take this with
                          a gain of salt).

                     she was able to bear children of the Sun
                     God. Note the sole of deer's foot looks like
                     a Vagina).  Zip would deceive hunters to
                     believe he was shooting a deer when in fact
                     it was a iguana (a sacred animal of Itzam
                     Na; to kill one incites the Death penalty).
                     To those who gained Zip's Favor meant a
                     successful hunt.

      26  -  Ah Ahaah Cab  -  &quot;Awakener&quot;  He is associated with

                             almond eye) at the place of His
                             Ajna Chakra.

      31  -  Hun Kak  -  &quot;Unique Fire&quot;  The Divine Fire that
                         consumes all what ever remains is
                         prepared for Divinity.

      32  -  Ben Ich  -  &quot;He of the Starry Sky&quot;


                                                                             838
