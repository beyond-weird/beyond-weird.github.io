                                   The Rede of the Wicca 
                      (Being known as the Counsel of the Wise Ones:)

          Bide the Wiccan laws ye must
          in Perfect Love and Perfect Trust

          Live and let live
          Freely take and freely give

          Cast the circle thrice about
          To keep all evil spirits out

          To bind the spell every time
          Let the spell be spake in rhyme

          Soft of eye and light of touch
          Speak little, listen much

          Deosil go by the waxing moon
          Sing and dance the Wiccan rune

          Widdershins go when the moon doth wane
          And the werewolf howls by the dread wolfsbane

          When the Lady's moon is new
          Kiss thy hand to her times two

          When the moon rides at her peak
          Then your heart's desire seek

          Heed the northwind's mighty gale
          Lock the door and drop the sail

          When the wind comes from the south
          Love will kiss thee on the mouth

          When the wind blows from the east
          Expect the new and set the feast

          When the west wind blows o'er thee
          Departed spirits restless be

          Nine woods in the cauldron go
          Burn them fast and burn them slow

          Elder be ye Lady's tree
          Burn it not or cursed ye'll be

          When the wheel begins to turn
          Let the Beltain fires burn

          When the wheel has turned to Yule
          Light the log and let Pan rule

          Heed ye flower, bush and tree
          By the Lady, Blessed be

          Where the rippling waters go
          Cast a stone and truth ye'll know


                                           1511
          

                                   The Rede of the Wicca 
                      (Being known as the Counsel of the Wise Ones:)
                              (continued from previous page)

          When ye have a need
          Hearken not to others' greed

          With the fool no season spend
          Nor be counted as his friend

          Merry meet and merry part
          Bright the cheeks and warm the heart

          Mind the Threefold Law ye should
          Three times bad and three times good

          When misfortune is enow
          Wear the blue star on thy brow

          True in love ever be
          Unless thy lover's false to thee

          Eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill
          An' it harm none, do what ye will


                                           1512
