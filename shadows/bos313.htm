                                   The Wiccan Rede (WCC) 


          Bide ye Wiccan laws ye must, 
          in perfect love and perfect trust
               Live ye must and let to live, 
               fairly take and fairly give
          Form the circle thrice about, 
          to keep unwelcome spirits out
               To bind the spell well every time, 
               let the spell be spake in rhyme
          Soft of eye and light of touch, 
          speak ye little, listen much
               Deosil go by the waxing moon, 
               sing and dance the Wiccan rune
          Widdershins go by the waning moon, 
          chanting out the baleful tune
               When the Lady's moon is new, 
               kiss the hand to her times two
          When the moon rides at Her peak, 
          then the heart's desire seek
               Heed the north wind's mighty gale, 
               lock the door and trim the sail
          When the wind comes from the south, 
          love will kiss kiss thee on the mouth
               When the wind blows from the west, 
               departed souls will have no rest
          When the wind blows from the east, 
          expect the new and set the feast
               Nine woods in the cauldron go, 
               burn them quick and burn them slow
          Elder be the Lady's tree, 
          burn it not or cursed you'll be
               When the wheel begins to turn, 
               soon the Beltain fires will burn
          When the wheel has turned to Yule, 
          light the log the Horned One rules
               Heed ye flower, bush and tree, 
               by the Lady blessed be
          Where the rippling waters flow, 
          cast a stone and the truth you'll know
               When you have and hold a need, 
               hearken not to others' greed
          With a fool no season spend, 
          nor be counted as his friend
               Merry meet and merry part, 
               bright the cheeks and warm the heart
          Mind the threefold law ye should, 
          three times bad and three times good
               When misfortune is anow, 
               wear the star upon thy brow
          True in love you must ever be, 
          lest thy love be false to thee
               These eight words the Wiccan Rede fulfill, 
               An Ye Harm None, Do What Ye   Will


                                                                            1541
