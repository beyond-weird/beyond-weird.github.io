<center><h1>Satanism vs. Wicca</h1><h4>by Diane Vera</h4></center>

<p>Since your main worry seems to be public relations, here's how I would make the distinction
between Wicca and Satanism, in a way that is fair to both sides and does not throw Satanists to
the dogs:</p>

<ul>Wicca and Satanism are quite distinct. Wiccans worship pre-Christian deities (or a modern-day
composite of pre-Christian deities) and do not worship the Christian anti-God. Some Satanists
also worship a pre-Christian deity, but regard the Christian anti-God as a manifestation of their
deity, which Wiccans do not. Wicca and Satanism are very different in their aims and tone. Wicca
emphasizes harmony and balance, whereas Satanism emphasizes spiritual self-liberation via
iconoclasm and catharsis.</ul>

<p>I should mention, though, there's one possible problem with that last sentence. Some feminist
Wiccans might take offense at it, since it implies the more radical forms of feminist Wicca are
really more like Satanism than like Wicca. Which in my opinion they are. If you've read some of
Mary Daly's books, you'll know what I mean.</p>

<p>I myself identify as a feminist Goddess-oriented neo-Pagan, as well as a Satanist. Indeed,
feminist Goddess religion is still my <i>primary</i> religious identification. (Satanism is how I
relate to &quot;male&quot; energy.) I don't and never did call myself a feminist
&quot;Wiccan&quot;.</p>

<p>By the way, while I accept today's use of the word Wicca (with a capital W) to refer to a
specific European-based religion with a very specific worldview, I do <i>not</i> accept the
attempt by Wiccans to copyright the words &quot;witch&quot; and &quot;witchcraft&quot;. These
words are generic terms, not the property of any one religion. They refer to occult practices
found in many religions around the world. A Satanist has as much right to the word
&quot;witch&quot; as anyone else. (It so happens that <i>I</i> don't call myself a
&quot;witch&quot;, but for a different reason: I think many &quot;witches&quot; are making
exaggerated claims to occult power, and I don't want to give the appearance of making such an
exaggerated claim.)</p>
