                                                 Inquisition 
            Again the burning came,
            She felt the heat, the searing pain
            a cry lanced through her heart
               &quot;Why, My Lady, Why&quot;

            She lay quietly, remembering
            lost within the labrynth of the past
            and the future
            she did not feel the bite of the cruel blade.




          Bleeding, moaning, she saw the man
            his face, and heart masked with black
            she knew his choices and his pain
            Oh, to cause pain, to accept his own
            if only she could Touch him, Heal him.

            &quot;I love you&quot; she whispered
            dark eyes calm, yet full of pain
            &quot;Don't &quot; cried the man &quot;I want to see you die&quot;
            &quot;I love you and forgive you&quot; she said
            tears rolled freely down her cheeks

            Again, and again the searing pain
            As the man applied the red hot blade
            &quot;Do you still love me, and forgive me&quot; he screamed?

            Despite the pain she answered strongly
            &quot;I do&quot;, She smiled
            &quot;Blessed be&quot; she whispered.

            A wave of pain sent her among the stars.
            &quot;My Lady&quot; she cried &quot;I'm frightened&quot;
            Strong arms held her close
            &quot;You have done well my child, rest now&quot;

            The man watched as the blade grew cold
            As the young body before him cooled
            tears streamed down his face
            and he whispered
                &quot;Forgive me&quot;

                                                                                           1907
