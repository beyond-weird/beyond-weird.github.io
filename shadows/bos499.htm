                          THE WICCAN REDE
                                  -Anonymous
         (Tune: &quot;Leatherwing Bat&quot; aka &quot;Celtic Circle Dance&quot;)

                                                                                
 Bide the wiccan laws you must,         When ye have and hold a need,         
 In perfect love and perfect trust:     Harken not to others greed            
 Live you must and let to live,         With a fool no season spend,          
 Fairly take and fairly give            Or be counted as his friend           
                                       
 Form the circle thrice about           When misfortune is enow,              
 To keep unwelcome spirits out          Wear the star upon thy brow           
 To bind your spell will every time,    True in love you ever be,             
 Let the spell be spake in rhyme        Lest thy love be false to thee        
                                                                              
 Soft of eye and light of touch,        Merry meet and merry part,            
 Speak you little, listen much          Bright the cheeks and warm the heart. 
 Deosil go by the waxing moon,          Mind the threefold law you should     
 Chanting out the baleful tune          Three times bad and three times good  
                                        
 When the Lady's moon is new,           Nine woods in the cauldron go,          
 Kiss your hand to her times two        Burn them fast and burn them slow       
 When the moon rides at her peak,       Elder be the Lady's tree,               
 Then your heart's desire seek          Burn it not or cursed you'll be         
                                                                                
 Heed the north winds mighty gale,      When the wheel begins to turn,          
 Lock the door and trim the sail        Soon the Beltane fires will burn        
 When the wind comes from the south,    When the wheel hath turned a Yule       
 Love will kiss thee on the mouth       Light the log the Horned One rules      
                                                                                
 When the wind blows from the east,     Heed you flower, bush and tree,         
 Expect the new and set the feast.      By the Lady blessed be                  
 When the wind blows from the west      Where the rippling waters go,           
 Bardic words be at their best!         Cast a stone, the truth you'll know     
                                       
                   Bide the wiccan laws you must,        
                   In perfect love and perfect trust:    
                   These words the wiccan rede fulfill;    
                   &quot;An harm you none, do what you will.&quot;   
                                        
                                     *               
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        


                                                                            2283
