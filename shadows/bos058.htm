<h1 align=center>The Charge of the Goddess</h1>

<p>Whenever ye have need of any thing, once in the month, and 
better it be when the moon is full, then shall ye assemble in 
some secret place and adore the spirit of She, who is Queen of 
all witches. There shall ye assemble, ye who are fain to learn 
all sorcery, yet have not won its deepest secrets; to these will 
She teach things that are yet unknown. And ye shall be free from 
slavery; and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall be naked 
in your rites; and ye shall dance, sing, feast, make music and 
love, all in Her praise. For Hers is the ecstasy of the spirit, 
and Hers also is joy on earth; for Her law is love unto all 
beings. Keep pure your highest ideal; strive ever towards it; let 
naught stop you or turn you aside. For Hers is the secret door 
which opens upon the land of youth and Hers is the cup of wine of 
life, and the cauldron of Cerridwen, which is the Holy Grail of 
immortality. She is the gracious goddess, who gives the gift of 
joy unto the heart of man. Upon earth, She gave the knowledge of 
the spirit eternal; and beyond death, She gives peace and 
freedom, and reunion with those who have gone before. Nor does 
She demand sacrifice, for behold, She is the mother of all 
living, and Her love is poured out upon the earth.</p>

<p>She who is the beauty of the green earth, and the white moon 
among the stars, and the mystery of the waters, and the desire of 
the heart of man, calls unto thy soul. Arise, and come unto Her. 
For She is the soul of nature, who gives life to the universe. 
from Her all things proceed, and unto Her all things must return; 
and before Her face, beloved of gods and men, let thine innermost 
divine self be enfolded in the rapture of the infinite. Let Her 
worship be within the heart that rejoiceth; for behold, all acts 
of love and pleasure are Her rituals. And therefore let there be 
beauty and strength, power and compassion, honor and humility, 
mirth and reverence within you. And thou who thinkest to seek 
Her, know thy seeking and yearning shall avail thee not unless 
thou knowest the mystery; that if that which thou seekest thou 
findest not within thee, then thou wilt never find it without 
thee. For behold, She has been with thee from the beginning; and 
She is that which is attained at the end of desire.</p>
