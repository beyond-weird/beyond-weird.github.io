<center><h1>Technology and The Craft</h1>
<h2>Removing the Barriers to Spaceflight</h2></center>

<p>Before the ritual begins, distribute paper and have an airplane-folding session.</p>

<h2>Techno-lesson #1: Making Fire</h2>

<p>He tries to light the fire with firesticks; She then enters, lights the 
charcoal with the sacred Bic, and hands it to He, who lights the quarter 
candles with it and hands it back to She, who lights the altar candles.</p>

<h3 align=center>Bless the Elements (She)</h3>

<ul>
<p>By the oceans that fed our grandparents<br>
And the oceans that will house our grandchildren<br>
I bless and purify this being of water.<br>
<br>
By the Earth from which our grandparents rose<br>
And the Earth which our grandchildren will watch rise<br>
I bless and purify this being of earth.<br>
<br>
By the wood fires of our grandparents<br>
And the fusion fires of our grandchildren<br>
I bless and purify this being of fire.<br>
<br>
By the airy realms our grandparents studied<br>
And the airy realms our grandchildren will walk<br>
I bless and purify this being of air.</p>
</ul>

<h3 align=center>Cast the Circle (He)</h3>

<ul>
<p>As the Moon cuts a Circle round the Earth<br>
As the Earth cuts a Circle round the Sun<br>
So I cut this Circle round us.<br>
<br>
As the rains wash the mountains<br>
As the oceans wash the beaches<br>
So I cleanse this Circle and we within it with Water and Salt.<br>
<br>
As the Moon charges the restless waters<br>
As the Sun charges all that is green and growing<br>
So I charge this Circle and we within it with Air and Fire.</p>
</ul>

<h3 align=center>Invoke Quarters (She)</h3>

<ul>
<p>I invoke thee, Mighty Ones of the East; bring us Your gifts of 
wisdom; watch over us in this Circle. Come to us in the name of 
Athena WiseWeaver! Hail and Welcome!</p>

<p>I invoke thee, Mighty Ones of theSouth; bring us Your gifts of will;
watch over us in this Circle. Come to us in the name of Brigid 
SmithMistress! Hail and Welcome!</p>

<p>I invoke thee, Mighty Ones of the West; bring us Your gifts of 
understanding; watch over us in this Circle. Come to us in the name
of Poseidon ShipMaster! Hail and Welcome!</p>

<p>I invoke thee, Mighty Ones of the North; bring us Your gifts of 
dedication; watch over us in this Circle. Come to us in the name of 
Ptah CraftsMaster! Hail and Welcome!</p>

<p>We are now between the worlds.</p>
</ul>

<P><b>All breathe, ground and center</b></p>

<h2>Techno-lesson #2: Overcoming Physical Shortcomings</h2>

<p>Chant: She Changes Everything She Touches</p>

<p>He &amp; She begin the chant, She drumming. Her shoulder starts acting up; He
gets out the Casio (tempo -2, any 4/4 rhythm). For the chant, mix verses
as is pleasing.</p>

<ul>
<p>She changes everything She touches and<br>
Everything She touches, changes.<br>
She changes everything She touches and<br>
Everything She touches, changes.<br>
<br>
We are the changers<br>
Everything we touch can change.<br>
Change us, touch us;<br>
Touch us, change us.<br>
<br>
Everything that dies is born again<br>
In a new place, on a new day.<br>
Everything that's lost is found again<br>
On a new day, in a new way.<br>
<br>
Io, Kore!<br>
Io, Kore!<br>
Io, Persephone!</p>
</ul>

<h2>Techno-lesson #3: Supplementing Abilities</h3>

<p>First, He &amp; She 'argue' about who's going to lead it, jokingly asking if 
anyone in Circle wants to do background music; then He gets pathworking
with music on audio tape. When pathworking is done, folks should still be
in light trance; the next thing is to concretize the working by
distributing pens so that people can put whatever they symbols they think
are appropriate on their airplanes.</p>

<p><b>Power chant:</b> A rising OM; which at peak leads into Countdown. At
&quot;Liftoff&quot;, throw the planes upwards (when done, planes can either be kept
or HP/S should offer to see that they get burned.</p>

<P><b>(* Note *) (* Note *) Don't forget to Ground (* Note *) (* Note *)</b></p>

<p><b>Grounding chant:</b></p>
<P>Earth below us<br>Drifting, falling<br>Floating weightless<br>Coming home.</p>
