<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Samhain ritual for a small Circle</H1>
<P>[<I>older woman to older man</I>]:<BR>One-eye, Wanderer, God of wisdom,<BR>Hunt-lord, hail, who leads the hosting!<BR>Nine nights hanging, knowledge gaining,<BR>Cloaked at crossroads, council hidden.<BR>Now the night, your time, is near us --<BR>Right roads send us on, Rune-winner.</P>
<P>[<I>older man to older woman</I>]:<BR>Every age your eye has witnessed;<BR>Cauldron-Keeper, hail wise Crone!<BR>Rede in riddles is your ration --<BR>Wyrd-weaving at the World-tree's root.<BR>Eldest ancient, all-knowing one,<BR>Speak secrets to us, send us vision.</P>
<P>[<I>younger woman to younger man</I>]:<BR>Lord of Life, hail Land-Master!<BR>God of grain that grows and dies<BR>And rises reborn, full of richness;<BR>Fallow fields shall yet be fertile --<BR>Spring sap runs as stirs your phallus<BR>Bless barren earth, let it bear again!</P>
<P>[<I>younger man to younger woman</I>]:<BR>Snow-shoes striding, hail swift Huntress!<BR>Wild one, free and willful Goddess<BR>Bow and blade you bear beside you,<BR>Finding food to fend off hunger --<BR>Winter will not leave us wanting;<BR>Give good hunting, grant us skill.</P>
<H3>USHERING IN THE NEW YEAR:</H3>
<P>Welcome winter, waning season,<BR>Now with night the new year comes;<BR>Hail the horse's head with blessings --<BR>Blessings be on those who bide here<BR>And indeed on all the world!</P>
<H3>SCRYING:</H3>
<P>Wide are the worldgates,<BR>Sights to be sent us;<BR>Ready for rede-gifts,<BR>We wait for your wisdom.</P>
<H3>OFFERINGS/THANKSGIVING:</H3>
<P>Grateful, we give now, gifts of our own<BR>Heart-work and hand-work the hearth shall grace;<BR>Happiness, harmony, health in the new year,<BR>Send to the world and we in it, we wish you.</P>
<H3>DISMISSAL/OPENING:</H3>
<P>To watching winds we wish fair travelling;<BR>To sleepless dead sweet rest we send;<BR>Gods and Goddesses, go with praises --<BR>See: the circle is severed thus. [<I>cut with sword at east</I>]</P>
<P>I wrote that ritual for David, myself and two friends who are older than we. It was the first ritual that I wrote not based on NROOGD material in any way, but on entirely original structure and material. The horse's skull is a primitive form of the Mari Lwyd (Grey Mare/Mary), a Welsh folk traditional hobby horse that goes from house to house at the calendar New Year, but she's such a bizarre and macabre beast that she was almost certainly a Samhain leftover. There's interesting material about her in Trefor Owen's &quot;Welsh Folk Customs&quot; (which is probably out of print, but I could provide photocopies for interested parties who provide copying costs...)</P>
<P>Happy Samhain!<BR>Leigh Ann<BR>ThelemaNet of Berkeley * (415)548-0163 (161/93)</P>
