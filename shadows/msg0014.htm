Here is a very effective personal cleansing spell that I would like to pass on to any who may have need of it.

Personal Cleansing
</P>
  
<P>
Choose candles according to your personal and daily  preferences, I have found that any will work.  Run a bath with as hot of water as you can stand.  If you prefer, this ritual can be done in the shower.  Use whatever bath oils work for you.  Visualize all the day's negative energies surrounding you as you get into the water.  Then, visualize all that negativity being removed from your Self by the water.  Focus on your candle flames, meditate on cleansing your Self.  When the water has cooled to the point of being uncomfortable, pull the stopper, and say these words: "Drain away these pains and troubles, As does this water pure and free.  Take with it all this day's distress.  As I will, so mote it be!"  Dry yourself off and rub your preferred cream onto your body to protect you from negativity over the night.  Prepare to sleep well!
</P>
   
<P>
This spell has worked wonders not only for me, but for other Wiccans that I have passed it to.  I would be honored if you would choose to place this simple spell into your online Book of Shadows.
