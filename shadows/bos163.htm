                                  Magick Vs. Prayer 
        One of the questions brought up on MagickNet was the difference between
     Magick and prayer, and how this ties into the scheme of things in general.
     Well, I feel that prayer and magick are only loosely connected.  In prayer,
     a person pleas with their deity for assistance.  Energy wise, the person
     praying is asking that something be changed, and believes that the request
     will result in a change.  
           In magick, we use ourinner energy, combined with earthly andelemental
     energy and Deity  energy, and send this forth do accomplish the goal of our
     spell.   I  think it's  like  &quot;breaking&quot;  in the  game  of pool.    We  are
     controlling stick  (our spell),  while we  gather the  energy  to push  the
     stick/spell.  Our  Cone Of Power is like the cue ball, and the racked balls
     are the target, which effects a change  (breaks, or the goal of our  spell)
     from the force of our energy.  There may be a point where prayer  becomes a
     type of magick  (or, a psychic event)  if the person knows  of the personal
     energies involved, and releases them with the prayer.
           I feel that aprayer works the opposite way. The prayer is arequest to
     effect a change in the  ambient energy and invoke God (using  the Christian
     form).   This change  in energy  is slower because  it is  &quot;diluted&quot; in the
     surrounding energy and depends solely on faith (&quot;I believe it  will happen,
     so it will&quot;). 
           Am I out  in left field or  just being redundant?   I forgive if  I'm
     &quot;running at the mouth&quot;.  Now I'll try and tie in Parapsychology.  Magic and
     psi are very  closely related  in that (aside  for leaving  out the 'k'  in
     magicK)  the  same form  of  energy  is used.    It's just  on  a different
     'frequency'.    When  I  do  an  object  reading  or  empathic  reading  on
     someone/thing,  I'm receiving  a type  of energy.   When I  send a  Cone of
     Power, I'm using the same type of energy, but on a (higher?) wavelength and
     with greater  force and higher  power.   Grounding negative feelings  is an
     example  of  converting one  form  to  the other.    Auric  healing is  the
     opposite.  So,  I feel the  energies are inter-changeable.       I ask,  as
     Elsbeth  has, &quot;What do you  think of THIS?&quot;  As  someone stated before, the
     definitions we are trying to define and  clarify are our own, much like our
     beliefs- our own.  We are trying to find, I believe,  common ground between
     the nuances of our definitions and beliefs.
