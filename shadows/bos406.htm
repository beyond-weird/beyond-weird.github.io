                                        INVOCATION OF THE HORNED GOD 

            By the flame that burneth bright,
            O Horned One!
            We call thy name into the night,
            O Ancient One!
            Thee we invoke, by moon-led sea,
            By the standing stone and the twisted tree.
            The we invoke, where gather thine own,
            By the nameless shrine forgotten and alone.
            Come where the round of the dance is trod,
            Horn and hoof of the goatfoot god!
            By moonlit meadow on dusky hill,
            When the haunted wood is hushed and still,
            Come to the charm of the chanted prayer,
            As the moon bewitches the midnight air.
            Evoke thy powers, that potent bide
            In shining stream and the secret tide,
            In fiery flame by starlight pale,
            In shadowy host that rides the gale,
            And by the fern-brakes fairy haunted
            Of forests wild and woods enchanted.
            Come! O come!
            To the heart-beat's drum!
            Come to us who gather below
            When the broad white moon is climbing slow
            Through the stars to the heaven;s height.
            We hear thy hoofs on the wind of night!
            As black tree-branches shake and sigh,
            By joy and terror we know thee nigh.
            We speak the spell thy power unlocks
            At solstice, Sabbat, and equinox,
            Word of virtue the veil to rend,
            From primal dawn to the wide world's end,
            Since time began--



          The blessing of Pan!
            Blessed be all in hearth and hold,
            Blessed in all worth more than gold.
            Blessed be in strength and love,
            Blessed be wher'er we rove.
            Vision fade not from our eyes
            Of the pagan paradise
            Past the gates of death and birth,
            Our inheritance of the earth.
            From our soul the song of spring
            Fade not in our wandering.
            Our life with all life is one,
            By blackest night or noonday sun.
            Eldest of gods, on thee we call,
            Blessing be on thy creatures all.
                                               Doreen Valiente
