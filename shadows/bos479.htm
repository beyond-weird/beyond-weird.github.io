          GLENN INNES STANDING STONES: THE FIRST STANDING STONES OF MODERN TIMES

          Glenn Innes in northern NSW is home to many people descended from
          Scottish, Welsh, Cornish, Manx and Irish immigrants. The streets have
          Gaelic street signs, and in a marvellous initiative, the local Council
          have erected a stone circle &quot;similar to those erected by Celtic People
          throughout Europe centuries ago&quot;. Three stones - named Gaelic, Bry-
          thonic and Australis - are the focal point of the circle; on the op-
          posite side of the circle four stones form the Southern Cross, with a
          Celtic stone acting as a pointer. Outside of the circle, stones at
          each of the cardinal points form an Ionic Cross.

          There are a total of 38 stones, with 24 being in the circle. Each one
          stands approximately 12 feet above the ground, and weighs several ton.
          Parts of the array of stones are intended to act as a calender, whilst
          other parts have a religious significance. Calculations by the Royal
          Australian Hydrographic Office were used to determine the position of
          the Winter Solstice; the positions of the Summer Solstice sunrise and
          sunset were observed on December 22nd 1990.

          Also in NSW, another stone circle - with a difference! At Mt Annan
          Botanical Gardens, 15 basalt crystal columns have been erected in a
          circle to form a &quot;sundial of human involvement&quot;. This analemmatic
          sundial uses a movable marker to cast a shadow. And the moveable
          marker? A human, with arms raised above their head! The circle is so
          situated that it is possible to look out across the Blue Mountains, to
          the Sydney skyline in the distance.


                                                                            2238
