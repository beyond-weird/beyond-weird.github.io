<center><h1>Yule in Britain</h1><h4>Copyright &copy; 1987, Tana Culain</h4></center>

<p>Midwinter has long been a traditional time for celebration and 
merrymaking in Britain. All of the activities at midwinter were 
meant to ensure that the season would renew itself and the days 
would begin to grow longer again. Greenery was brought into 
decorate the house: evergreen to symbolize the promise of life to 
come even in the darkest winter; the mistletoe, believed to hold 
the life of the host tree even when the tree itself appeared to 
be dead in winter; and the holly and ivy, symbols of male and 
female, both of course necessary for new life. Carols, some of 
which survive to this day, such as the Gower Wassail, were sung. 
The earliest carols consisted of taking hands and singing while 
dancing in a ring or around a bush, May tree, or even an apple 
tree (as in the case of the Apple Tree Wassail, sung in hopes of 
a good crop of cider the following year).</p>
 
<p>The Wassail Carols in particular date back to the Viking 
invasions of England, about 700 A.D., when the greeting was &quot;Ves 
heill&quot;. By Anglo-Saxon times, the greeting had evolved into &quot;Waes 
thu hal&quot;, meaning &quot;be whole&quot; or &quot;good health&quot;. The response was 
&quot;drink  hail&quot;, meaning &quot;I drink and good luck be to you&quot;. People 
would travel from house to house in the village bringing good 
wishes and carrying an empty bowl. The master of the house being 
wassailed was expected to fill the bowl with a hot spicy ale and 
then it would be passed around to the carolers.</p>

<p>Midwinter was also a time for exchanging gifts and for feasting. 
Turkey only dates to the 1500's. Much more common were boar, 
geese, capons, swans, and pheasants. Minced pies were originally 
made with meat, and with the coming of spices to England during 
the Crusades, plum pudding became quite the traditional dish. 
Plum pudding makes a great dish for cakes and wine in the Yule 
circle, especially if you pour warmed brandy over it and set it 
afire before the blessing.</p>

<p>While I am writing about midwinter customs in Britain because our 
heritage in .K.A.M. is largely Celtic in origin, the Isles do not 
have a monopoly on Yule. The Romans celebrated Saturnalia for 
seven days around the Solstice, and it was a time to look ahead 
and rejoice in the longer days to come. Slaves and masters 
switched places at table, and presents were exchanged. The 
Persian Mithraists held December 25th as sacred to the birth of 
their Sun God, Mithras, and celebrated it as a victory of light 
over darkness. And in Sweden, December 13th was sacred to the 
Goddess Lucina, Shining One, and was a celebration of the return 
of the light. On Yule itself, around the 21st, bonfires were lit 
to honor Odin and Thor.</p>

<p>Midwinter has always been a Pagan holiday, so much so that during 
the 1600's the Christian Christmas was recognized as a 
celebration based on Pagan customs and was outlawed in England 
and many of the colonies in America.</p>

<pre>A Monthly Rune (Traditional) 

January   By this fire I warm my hands 
February  And with my spade I delve my lands 
March     Here I set my seeds to spring 
April     And here I hear the birds to sing 
May       I am as light as bird in the treetop 
June      And I take pains to weed my crop 
July      With my scythe my mead I mow 
August    And here I shear my corn full low 
September With my flail I earn my bread 
October   And here I sow my wheat so red (Winter wheat) 
November  At Martinmas I kill my swine * 
December  And at Yule I drink red wine 
</pre>
<p>* Martinmas, November 11, is a christianization of the Pagan 
Celtic Hallows when the herds were culled.</p>

<p>Recipe for Wassail for 8</p>

<p>3 red apples<br>
3 oz brown sugar<br>
2 pints brown ale, apple cider, or hard cider<br>
1/2 pint dry sherry or dry white wine<br>
1/4 tsp cinnamon<br>
1/4 teaspoon ginger<br>
strips of lemon peel</p>

<p>Core and heat apples with brown sugar and some of the ale or 
cider in an oven for 30 minutes.  Put in large pan and add rest 
of spices and lemon peel, simmer on stove top of 5 minutes. Add 
most of the alcohol at the last minute so it heats up but does 
not evaporate. Burgundy and brandy  can be substituted to the ale 
and sherry. White sugar and halved oranges may also be added to 
taste.<p>

<p>Plum Pudding</p>

<p>1/4 lb. flour<br>
1/4 lb. currants<br>
1 tsp. salt<br>
1/4 lb. sultanas (small raisins)<br>
1 tsp. allspice<br>
2 cooking apples, peeled, cored and chopped<br>
1 tsp. ginger<br>
1 ounce cut mixed (citrus) peel<br>
1 tsp. cinnamon<br>
2 oz. shredded almonds<br>
pinch fresh grated nutmeg<br>
Juice and grated rind of 1 orange and 1 lemon<br>
1/4 lb. fresh breadcrumbs<br>
1/4 lb. molasses (treacle)<br>
1/2 lb. shredded suet<br>
4 large eggs<br>
1/4 lb. brown sugar<br>
2 tbsp. brandy<br>
1/4 lb. dried chopped apricots<br>
1/4 lb. prunes<br>
1/4 lb dates</p>


<p>Sift flour, salt and spices into a large bowl. Stir in 
breadcrumbs, suet and sugar. Add fruits, peel and rind. Beat 
lemon and orange juice, molasses and eggs together and add to 
other ingredients.  Steam for 6 hours -- a coffee tin filled with 
the mixture and placed in a steamer in a covered pan does well.  
A little vinegar and lemon juice in the water will prevent the 
pan from discoloration.  After steaming cover in a cool place and 
let age as long as possible -- usually about 5 weeks.  To serve, 
re-steam for another 3 hours.  Remove from tin, douse with warm 
brandy and set it ablaze!</p>

<p>If you haven't got six weeks before Yule to prepare a proper 
pudding (I never do) a tinned one from Crosse &amp; Blackwell will do 
fine. Just be sure to always heat the pudding first, no matter 
who made it, or all the warmed brandy in the world won't help. 
And don't forget the hard sauce!</p>
