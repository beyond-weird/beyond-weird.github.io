                                    SPIRITUALITY

                 &quot;What is `spirituality'? Does it matter much today?
          And what is something `sacred'? Is it black and white...or grey?&quot;
            These were the queries of a youngster, and gave me pause for
                                      thought;
           And as I rummaged through my mind, I found the words I sought.
            &quot;Spirituality is a relationship 'twixt the Universe and you,
              And how you behave will manifest, no matter what you do!

            It's a friendship with creation - with stones and plants and
                                       trees,
             With birds and deer and butterflies...and even bumblebees;
           It's knowing that the life you have, is found in them, as well;
                It's awareness that creation is found in every realm,
                And that all of it is sacred and all of it's divine!
              That means it's very special - and will be for all time!

          The answers to your questions are both black and white, and grey,
             As spirituality and sacredness depends on you...each day!&quot;
               I pondered well his queries as he slipped out the door,
           And wondered if I'd answered well - or if I should say more...
                 But looking out the window, I saw him smile at me,
            And knew that I'd said plenty, as he reached out and hugged a
                                        tree!
