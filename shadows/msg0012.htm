<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">AURAS</H1>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">by Jonathan Milne</H1>
<P>An aura is the energy field around all each matter that takes space (excluding air itself), whether that is a person, plant, animal, or an object. Each colour represents a different aspect of that matter. Reading auras can be useful in determining whether you should confront a person at a certain time; what you can do to improve your present condition; tune you in to illnesses and conditions around you, and many other benefits. Every time you come into contact with someone, your aura reacts to his or hers. If your aura's frequency is close to theirs, you will feel close to them quickly and drawn to them. If not, you may feel an instant dislike towards them. </P>
<P>Everything has an aura. We have been "trained" not to see them, but with a little practice many people can successfully see and read them. Below I've listed what the different colours of auras mean, but first you should learn how to read them. When you begin, you may have a hard time seeing the colours. A lot of times, beginners will see pale colours such as white, yellow, and light blue. As time passes, and with practice, you will see that the colours seem to become brighter to you and easier to read. A little bit of patience can go a long way. </P>
<H3>ASTRAL AURA</H3>
<P>The astral aura extends about eight to twelve inches from the physical body and appears as brightly coloured rainbow clouds. The astral aura is the bridge between the physical world and the spiritual world. </P>
<H3>ETHERIC TEMPLATE AURA</H3>
<P>The etheric template aura extends about twelve to twenty-four inches from the physical body and appears as a blue print form. There is an empty groove in the etheric aura into which the etheric aura fits. The etheric template aura holds the etheric aura in place. It is the template for the etheric dimension. </P>
<H3>THE CELESTIAL AURA</H3>
<P>The celestial aura extends about twenty-four inches from the physical body and appears as a bright shimmering light of pastel colours. This is the level of feelings within the world of our spirit. Here we communicate with all the beings of the spiritual world. </P>
<H3>KETHERIC TEMPLATE AURA</H3>
<P>The ketheric template aura extends about thirty six to forty eight inches from the physical body and appears as an extremely bright golden light that is rapidly pulsating. This aura takes on the form of a golden egg that surrounds and protects everything within it. </P>
<H3>HOW TO SEE THE AURA</H3>
<P>Everybody has the ability to see the aura. For beginners a low light is the best way to start. </P>
<P>Turn out the lights and lay on the bed. Leave the window curtains open and let the natural light flow in. As you are lying on the bed hold your hands out at full distance in front of you. Don't stare hard but rather just gaze at your hands. Moving your hands slowly, bring your fingertips together until they are almost touching. You will notice a cloudy blue haze appear around your finger. This is the etheric aura. </P>
<H3>FEELING THE AURA</H3>
<P>Draw a circle on your left hand using your right fingertip. Don't let your finger touch your hand; keep it at a distance of about a half inch. Move slowly. You will feel the power of your aura. </P>
<H3>How to Read the Aura</H3>
<P>First of all, find a place where you won't be around any harsh light; soft light is best to read auras. You will also need a piece of white paper large enough to place your whole hand on. </P>
<P>Place your hand on the cardboard and relax your eyes. Don't stare at your hand; rather look at the areas around the fingertips and fingers. </P>
<P>After a while, if you are relaxed enough, you will begin to see a soft haze around your hand. If you look at it long enough, you will start to see colours. Beginners can usually make out only one colour, but as you get better you will be able to see more at one time. </P>
<P>Don't be discouraged if you don't see anything the first few times. It takes practice to become good at reading auras, and after a while you will realize that it's not really as hard as you might have first thought. </P>
<P>You may also wish to take nonliving objects, like rocks and such, and try to see their auras as well. This can be very good practice for you. </P>
<H3>Colours of Auras</H3>
<P>The following are the more common colours: </P>
<P>Red--The colour of strength, strong passion, and will. Dark red may symbolize one who has a quick temper and is nervous or impulsive. All red relates to nervous tendencies. </P>
<P>Orange--Colour of warmth, thoughtfulness, and creativity. The muddier shades may represent pride or vanity, while golden orange denotes self-control. A person with orange in their aura may suffer from kidney ailments. </P>
<P>Yellow--Mental activity, optimism. It can mean new learning opportunities and wisdom. A golden yellow means that the person takes care of him or herself. Ruddy yellow may mean that its owner is shy. </P>
<P>Green--Green is the colour of sympathy and calm. A person who has green in his or her aura may be very good at the healing arts and is very reliable. Dark shades of green can indicate one who is jealous or uncertain. </P>
<P>Blue--The colour of quiet and calm. Any blue in the aura is good to have, but deep blue is the best. One with deep blue in his or her aura shows a person who has found his or her work in life. Many are spiritual minded as well. Blue may sometimes represent a tendency to be moody and depressed. </P>
<P>Indigo and Violet--The colours of one who is seeking something in life. They represent an ability to handle affairs with worldliness and practicality. Dark shades may show that the person has obstacles to overcome and is feeling misunderstood. </P>
<P>Black--The colour of protection. May reflect a person who is hiding something. It may possibly indicate imbalances as well. </P>
<P>Here are some other colours that may be seen within the aura: </P>
<P>Pink--This is the colour of love. It represents compassion, and possibly a love of art and beauty. Darker or muddier shades of pink may point to an individual who is immature. </P>
<P>White--Many times this is one of the first colours you will see in an aura. However, when it is a true and strong colour of the aura, it reflects purity and truth. </P>
<P>Brown--This could reflect a person who is very "earthy" and that a person is establishing new roots. However, if it is seen in the chakras, it may mean that a person's energy is in some way being blocked. </P>
<P>Silver Lights or Twinkles--Seeing these in a person's aura may mean that they are pregnant, or have been or may soon be. However, this is not always so. Seeing this may indicate a person who is allowing great creativity in their life. </P>
<P>Black Spots--The presence of black spots in the aura may indicate that it is imbalanced in some areas. This may mean that the person has some negative habits that he or she should work on. </P>
