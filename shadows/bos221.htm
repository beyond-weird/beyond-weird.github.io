                            CHECKLIST FOR A WELL-WORKING GROUP 

          1.  We are clear about our goals and how  we  intend  to  achieve
          them.

          2.  We  know  and  respect  each  other  well enough to feel very
          comfortable and attuned working together.

          3.   Our  magickal  is  ethical,  designed  for  our  growth  and
          fulfillment  and  the  benefit of those who request help,  and it
          never used to harm others.

          4.  We share the responsibilities of making the group work; every
          individual's contribution is important.

          5.  We see each other socially outside  the  group,  and  support
          each other through difficulties.

          6.  We enjoy. there is fun and laughter at our meetings.


          7.  We  work at learning magick.  We dig deep,  compare different
          sources, try new techniques,  ask pointed questions,  do it until
          we get it right.

          8.  We  keep  ourselves  healthy and fit in order to more readily
          channel power and receive insight.

          9.  We keep our ritual area and tools orderly and clean.

          10.  We constantly seek knowledge from many  sources  --  people,
          books, workshops, other paths...

          11. We do not make a virtue of authority and obedience, but treat
          each   other  as  respected  equals  (regardless  of  the  formal
          structure of the coven).

          12.  We raise genuine power and channel it;  our rituals are  not
          tame readings or rote gestures, but filled with energy, vitality,
          will and purpose.
