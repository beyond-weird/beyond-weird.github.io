                                                 AMPHITRITE 
              
             The Lady went out sailing, 
             She spoke to all She saw, 
             And all who heard took ship with Her 
             And signed the sailors' law. 
             She sailed across the foamy waves, 
             Her trident in Her hand, 
             Her throwing-net beside Her, 
             And little thought of land. 
                  The Lady went out sailing. 
              
             Her vessel had a heart of oak, 
             And hearts of oak her crew, 
             Her rig was square, five-masted, 
             Her compass always true. 
             The mermaids swam before her, 
             The whales swam in her wake, 
             The dolphins on her bow-wave, 
             On any course she'd take. 
                  The Lady went out sailing. 
              
             The young and brash Earth-Shaker 
             Espied the Lady's ship 
             And vowed he'd have both Lady 
             And boat beneath his whip. 
             He hungered to be Sea-Lord; 
             He took his winged horse 
             And busked them both for battle, 
             And dogged the Lady's course. 
                  The Lady went out sailing. 



                                     AMPHITRITE  (cont.)  
             At length, he overtook them, 
             And lighted on the stern. 
             He drew his sword for boarding; 
             He felt his passion burn. 
             The oaken-hearted crewmaids 
             Dodged as he swung apace 
             They made a path before him 
             To give their Captain space. 
                  The Lady went out sailing. 
              
             The Lady stood before him; 
             He raised his sword to slice. 
             She stood firm; with Her trident 
             She smote the deck thrice. 
             A wrenching seized his belly; 
             He rushed to the lee side 
             To puke his guts while laughter 
             Assailed his godly pride. 
                  The Lady went out sailing. 
              

             &quot;And what would you, bold pirate?&quot; 
             The Lady asked with force. 
             &quot;I just want off this vessel!&quot; 
             They led him to his horse. 
             He mounted to take leave of those 
             Who at young gods would scoff. 
             But he'd barely room for landing-- 
             And none for taking off! 
                  The Lady went out sailing. 
              
             &quot;You've lost!&quot; cried Amphitrite 
             Her net stopped his career 
             &quot;Now--tell me what you came for 
             You half-baked buccaneer.&quot; 
             &quot;I came to take your crewmaids 
             And vessel for my fee, 
             But most of all your maidenhead 
             And Lordship of the Sea. 
                  The Lady went out sailing. 
              
             &quot;I think you're cute&quot;, the Lady said 
             &quot;Too cute to feed to fishes, 
             &quot;And so that Zeus might call you strong 
             &quot;I'll grant most of your wishes. 
             &quot;You may have My net and fork; 
             &quot;I've better stored below, 
             &quot;And you may have My oaken car 
             &quot;To sail where winds might blow.&quot; 
                  The Lady went out sailing. 



            
           &quot;My crewmaids are not Mine to give, 
             &quot;But you may call Me wife. 
             &quot;Our wedding night, Poseidon dear, 
             &quot;Must last you all your life, 
             &quot;For you shall rule the Middle Sea 
             &quot;And none shall take your place, 
             &quot;But I shall rule the Ocean 
             &quot;And the boundless deeps of Space.&quot; 
                  The Lady went out sailing.
