                    TWO MAGICIANS       
                     (Child #44)        
       recorded by Steeleye Span &quot;Below the Salt&quot;
                                        
  She looked out of the window, as white as any milk
  He looked in at the window, as black as any silk
                                        
  (Chorus): Hello, hello, hello, hello you coal black smith
            You have done me no harm!   
            You never shall have my maidenhead
            That I have kept so long!   
            I'd rather die a maid, aye, and then she said,
            And be buried all in my grave,
            Than to have such a nasty,  
            husky, dusky, fusty, musty coal black smith!
            A maiden I will die!        
                                        
  She became a duck, a duck all in the stream
  And he became a waterdog, and fetched her back again
                                        
  She became a star, a star all in the night
  And he became a thundercloud and muffled her out of sight
                                        
  She became a rose, a rose all in the wood
  And he became a bumblebee and kissed her where she stood
                                        
  She became a nun, a nun all dressed in white
  And he became a chantry priest to pray for her by night
                                        
  She became a trout, a trout all in the brook
  And he became a feathered fly, and catched her with his hook
                                        
  She became a quilt, a quilt all on her bed
  And he became a coverlet, and gained her maidenhead!
