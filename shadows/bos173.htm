               FIVE FOLD KISS FEMALE

          The High Priest kneels before the High Priestess and gives her the
     Five Fold Kiss; that is, he kisses her on both feet, both knees, womb, both
     breasts, and the lips, starting with the right of each pair. He says, as he
     does this:


               &quot;Blessed be thy feet, that have brought thee in these ways.

               Blessed be thy knees, that shall kneel at the sacred altar.

               Blessed be thy womb, without which we would not be.

               Blessed be thy breasts, formed in beauty.

               Blessed be thy lips, that shall utter the Sacred Names.&quot;



     For the kiss on the lips, they embrace, length-to-length, with their feet 
     touching each others. When he reaches  the womb, she spreads her arms wide,
     and
     the same after the kiss on the lips.
