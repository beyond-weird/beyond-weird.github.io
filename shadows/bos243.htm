     ASCII MUSICAL NOTATION
     developed by Leigh Ann Hussey
     with help from Shadowthought and Josh Gordon

     Each  line  of  the  music  consists  of  4  lines  of  music.    The  time
     signature(s),
     the lines  between bars, and each  note take up one  column, with modifiers
     such
     as sharps, flats, and dots extending a note up to three columns.  The time
     signature is written  at the beginning in the obvious  way.  Three vertical
     bars
     (lines 2 to 4) mark the divisions between measures.  Lines 1 to 3 indicate
     note durations, as follows:

          1/16   1/8   1/4   1/2   dotted-1/2   1/8    1/4
          note   note  note  note     note      rest   rest
           =      _
           |      |     |     |        |         '      %
           |      |     |     o        o.

     Line 4 indicates the pitch.  The numbers 1 to 8 mark the octave including
     middle C (A through F);   1' to 8', one octave  above middle C;  1&quot; to  8&quot;,
     two
     octaves above  middle C;  '1 to  '8, the  octave below  middle C. A  number
     followed
     by a  #  is a  sharp;  a number  followed  by a  lower-case  b is  a  flat.
     Underscores
     connecting a note to the next note indicate a slur.  Consider the following
     examples:

                                      HOOF AND HORN

     From Crowley: &quot;Note  that 'shi' means rest, the absolute  or male aspect of
     the
     Deity; 'va' is energy, the manifested or female side of Deity. This mantra
     represents the whole course of  the Universe, from Zero through  the finite
     back
     to Zero.&quot;
