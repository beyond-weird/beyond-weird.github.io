<center><h1>Smudging: How to do it -- how <u>not</u> to do it</h1> 
<h4>Michelle Chihacou White Puma Klein-Hass</h4></center>
                                           
     <p>I came across a very interesting article from &quot;Shaman's Drum&quot; which 
     was reprinted for Vision Quest Bookstore.  I will attempt to convey 
     the gist of it, along with my views, as a student of the Ways of the 
     Teneh, about it. Smudging is a way of using the smoke from burning 
     herbs as a way to cleanse the body, an object, or a given area of 
     negative influences.  I myself use smudging to &quot;cleanse&quot; crystals 
     before using them in jewelry projects I may do, and for protecting my 
     home from some recent &quot;bad vibe&quot;-producing events. (landlord 
     troubles!)  I imagine that the skillful use of the proper herbs could 
     help in warding and banishing ceremonies as well, if used properly and 
     with reverence. The three most used plant material for smudging are 
     sage of all types, cedar and sweetgrass.</p>

<dl>      
<dt><u>Sage</u></dt>

<dd><p>     There are two major genii and several varieties of each genus of Sage 
     that are used for smudging.  <i>Salvia</i>, or the herb sage used for cooking, 
     comes in two major varieties: <i>S. officinalis</i>, commonly known as Garden 
     Sage, and <i>S. apiana</i>, commonly known as White Sage.  <i>Salvia</i> varieties 
     have long been acknowledged as healing herbs, reflected in the fact 
     that its genus name comes from the Latin root word <i>salvare</i>, which is 
     the verb &quot;to heal&quot; or &quot;to save.&quot; <i>Artemisia</i> is the genus commonly 
     considered &quot;Sagebrush&quot;, and is more common in the wilds out here in 
     California. There are two major varieties to the <i>Artemisia</i> genus: 
     <i>A. californica</i> or Common Sagebrush, and <i>A. vulgaris</i> or Mugwort. 
     There are many other varieties of both <i>Salvia</i> and <i>Artemisia</i>, and all are 
     effective in smudging.  Sage is burned in smudging ceremonies to drive 
     out evil spirits, negative thoughts and feelings, and to keep Gan'n 
     (negative entities) away from areas where ceremonials take place.  In 
     the Plains Sweatlodge, the floor of the structure is strewn with sage 
     leaves for the participants to  rub on their bodies during the sweat. 
     Sage is also used in keeping sacred objects like pipes or Peyote wands 
     safe from negative influence.  In the Sioux nation, the Sacred Pipe is 
     kept in a bundle with sage boughs.  I would think special crystals could 
     be so protected this way as well.</p></dd>
      
<dt><u>Cedar</u></dt>

<dd><p>     True cedar is of the <i>Thuja</i> and <i>Libocedrus</i> genii.  Some Junipers 
     (<i>Juniperus genus</i>) are also called &quot;cedar&quot;, thus complicating things some. 
     Some Juniper varieties <i>are</i> cleansing herbs, especially <i>J. monosperma</i>, or 
     Desert White Cedar.  But for smudging, the best is Western Red Cedar 
     (<i>Thuja occidentalis</i>) and California Incense Cedar (<i>Libocedrus descurrens</i>). 
     Cedar is burnt while praying to the Great Spirit (Usen', the Source -- also 
     known to Plains nations as Wakan Tanka) in meditation, and also to bless a 
     house before moving in as is the tradition in the Northwest and 
     Western Canada.  It works both as a purifier and as a way to attract 
     <i>good</i> energy in your direction.  It is usually available in herb stores 
     in chipped form, which must be sprinkled over a charcoal in a brazier. 
     I like a piece of charcoaled mesquite for this purpose, rather than 
     the commercial charcoal cake.</p></dd>

<dt><u>Sweetgrass</u></dt>

<dd><p>     Very important to the Sioux and Cherokee nations, its botanical name is 
     <i>Hierochlo&euml; odorata</i>.  In these tribes, the sweetgrass is braided like hair 
     braids. It could be burnt by lighting the end of it, or (more economically)
     by shaving little bits of it onto charcoal in a brazier.  Again, use 
     charcoaled Mesquite (I believe it comes packaged for barbecue use 
     under the brand name &quot;Red Arrow&quot;) to burn it, not pressed charcoal 
     tablets.  Sweetgrass is burnt after smudging with sage, to welcome in 
     good influences after the bad had been driven out. Sweetgrass is very 
     rare today, and traditional Plains people have been attempting to 
     protect the last of it.  Myself, I believe that Cedar, which is not 
     endangered, can safely be used this way.  Also Pi&ntilde;on pine needles 
     (used more frequently by the Southwest Teneh, like the Navajo and 
     Apache as well as the Pueblo people and the Zuni) and Copal (used by 
     the Yaqui and in ancient times by the Azteca and the Maya) have 
     similar effect.  The three mentioned here are readily available either 
     through gathering yourself or, in the case of copal resin, from any 
     good herb shop.</p></dd>
      
<dt><u>Using Smudging</u></dt>

<dd><p>     Burn clippings of the herb in a brazier... not a shell as some &quot;new age&quot; 
     shamanic circles do... it is an insult to White Painted Woman (The  Goddess)
     to do this, especially with the abalone shell which is especially sacred 
     to Her. If the herb is bundled in a &quot;wand&quot;, you can also  light the end 
     of the wand that isn't woody and use  that.  I like the latter way.  Direct
     the smoke with your hands or with a Peyote (feather) wand over the 
     person or thing you wish to smudge.  If you can see auras, look for 
     discolored places in the aura and direct the healing smoke towards 
     those places on the patient's body.  For cleansing a house, first 
     offer cedar smoke to the four directions outside the house.  Then, 
     take a sage bough and go throughout the inside of the house, making 
     sure the smoke penetrates every nook and cranny of the house.  It 
     might help also, if you have a power animal, to visualize your animal 
     doing these things, to also dance your animal, and if you have a power 
     song, to sing that too.  Then finally, run through the house with a 
     white candle that is well protected, to &quot;light up&quot; the house.  Careful 
     not to burn it down when you do it!!!</p></dd>
      
<dt>     <u>Final Thoughts</u></dt>

<dd><p>     Smudging should be done with care, with reverence, and in an attitude 
     of LOVE.  Show your respect and honor to the plants that Usen' has 
     given us for our healing, and they will return the favor by keeping us 
     well and free from disease and negative energy. Aloe Vera plants, 
     though not to be burnt, are good for the cleansing angle as well.  Keep 
     one or more potted Aloe Veras in the house (modern varieties are too 
     tender to plant in anything but full shade outside) in organic (wood 
     or ceramic, never plastic or metal) pots.  To honor the plant when you 
     transplant it, sprinkle the roots with corn meal and smudge it with 
     cedar once it is transplanted.  The spirit of Aloe Vera is a good 
     protective spirit, and if you burn yourself, can also be used to heal 
     your skin.  <i>Be sure to ask the plant's permission</i> before cutting part 
     of the leaf off for the healing juice.  If you don't, the protective 
     power of the plant will cease, and you will be left with but an inert 
     houseplant... and perhaps some bad karma to boot.</p></dd>
