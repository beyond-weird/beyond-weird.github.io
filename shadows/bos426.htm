                                 BATTLE HYMN OF THE ERISTOCRACY 
                                          (Tune: Battle Hymn of the Republic)
             
            1.  Mine brain has meditated on the spinning of The Chao;
                It is hovering o'er the table where the Chiefs of Staff are now
                Gathered in discussion of the dropping of The Bomb;
                Her Apple Corps is strong!
             
            Chorus:
                 Grand (and gory) Old Discordia!
                Grand (and gory) Old Discordia!
                Grand (and gory) Old Discordia!
                Her Apple Corps is strong!
             
            2.  She was not invited to the party held on Olympic;
                So she threw a Golden Apple, 'stead of turned the other cheek!
                Oh, it cracked the Holy Punchbowl and it made the nectar leak;
                Her Apple Corps is strong!
             
            3.  For the Apple Hera offered Paris all the wealth she could;
                Athena promised that his enemies bodies would be strewed;
                But Aphrodite offered Helen - and EVERYONE got screwed!
                Her Apple Corps is strong!
                                                                                           1911
