<center><h1>Tool Blessing Ritual</h1>
<h3>A purification of objects for ritual use and their transformation into magical items.</h3>
</center>

<p>(<i>The area is prepared by placing a quantity of each element in the proper
quarter, as well as preparing the altar in the usual way. If available, a
cauldron (empty) is placed in the center of the circle.  Candles are placed
at each  of the four  corners and  lit, progressing deosil  from the  east.
Salt and  water are blessed, and  the celebrants are purified  with them. A
magic circle is cast, and watchtowers summoned.  The god is then drawn down
as follows:<br>
The priest stands before the alter in the Osiris position, arms crossed
across chest and feet together.   The Priestess kneels before him with face
and arms upraised.</i>)</p>
