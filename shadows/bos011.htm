<H3>Preliminaries</H3>
<H4>WATER:</H4>
<P>Blessings upon thee, O creature of water, I cast out from thee all impurities and uncleanness of the spirits of phantasm, confusion or any other influence not for the free will of all.</P>
<H4>SALT:</H4>
<P>Blessings be upon this creature of salt; let all malignity and hindrance be cast forth thencefrom, and let all good enter therein. Wherefore I bless thee and invoke thee, that thou mayest aid me.</P>

<P>Wherefore do I bless thee and consecrate thee, in the names of Cernunnos and Aradia.</P>
