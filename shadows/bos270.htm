                              SPELL TO EASE A BROKEN HEART*                     

                                       John Shaman 
            You will need the following ingredients (be sure to charge them all
          before you begin):                                                    
           
          strawberry tea (one bag)     Small wand or stick from a willow tree
          sea salt                     2 pink candles
          a mirror                     one pink drawstring bag
          one quartz crystal           a copper penny
          a bowl made of china or crystal that is special to you
          1 teaspoon dried jasmine     1 teaspoon orris-root powder
          1 tsp. strawberry leaves     1 teaspoon yarrow
          10 plus drops apple-blossom oil or peach oil
          10 plus drops strawberry oil                                          
           
            On a Friday morning or evening (the day sacred to Venus) take a bath
          in sea salt in the light of a pink candle. As you dry off and dress,
          sip the strawberry tea. Use a dab of strawberry oil as perfume or
          cologne. Apply makeup or groom yourself to look your best. Cast a
          circle with the willow wand around a table the the other ingredients.
          Light the second pink candle. Mix all oils and herbs in the bowl.
          While you stir look at yourself in the mirror and say aloud: &quot;Oh,
          Great Mother Goddess, enclose me in your loving arms and nurture and
          bring forth the Goddess within me.&quot; Gaze deeply into the mirror after
          you have finished mixing the ingredients and say aloud, &quot;I represent
          the Great Goddess, Mother of all things. I shine in the light of the
          Golden Wings of Isis. All that is great and loving only belongs to
          me.&quot; Then put half the mixture in the pink bag and add the penny and
          crystal. Carry it with you always [or until you find another love].
          Leave the other half of the potion in the bowl, out in a room where
          you will smell the fragrance. Repeat this ritual every Friday if
          necessary.                                                            
           
          *From Laurie Cabot's &quot;Power of the Witch&quot;
           Brackets mine.
           
          Needless to say, you should replace the goddess name with one that you
          attune
          to.
