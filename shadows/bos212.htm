                                     Magick Christians 
                                    By: Alfgar Maharg 

              Greetings   from   BaphoNet.   Apparently,   I   fall   into   the
          &quot;Non-Traditional  Christian&quot;  box.  I  shall now  proceed  to  confuse
          everybody by refusing to fit into any pigeonhole. 

            I have been for some ten years a member of the New Church 
          (&quot;Swedenborgian&quot;).  

          The 18th  century  revelations found  in  the voluminous  writings  of
          Emmanuel  Swedenborg, renowned  scientist, theologiand  and visionary,
          overwhelmed by MAKING SENSE.  However, we have yet a  considerable way
          to go in conveying the news to the public at large. On announcing that
          one is a  Swedenborgian, approximately 62%  of the population  respond
          with &quot;What church is that?&quot; 29% ask  &quot;Is that the Swedish Church?&quot; The
          rest simply stand there with mouths open. 

                When asked what he was teaching, Swedenborg replied &quot;Two things:
          that God is one, and that faith is inseparable from charity.&quot; 

                Point 1 means that the Lord Jesus Christis the SAME God who made
          Heaven and Earth and no nonsense about it. Worship is always addressed
          to Christ, not to any &quot;trinity&quot;. 

                Point 2 represents arepudiation of salvation &quot;by faithalone&quot;. We
          hold most emphatically  the truth  of James: &quot;Faith  without works  is
          dead&quot;. 

             Naturally, things could not be left so simple. I look forward to 
          discussing the immoderately abstruse issues involved. 

                Just in case you are not confused enough already, I found myself
          drawn  into the  pursuit  of the  so-called  &quot;high&quot; occult.  This  led
          directly to  the formation of  the Third Order  of St.  Michael, which
          coalesced  from  the  set  of  esoteric  Christians  collected  around
          Katheriine Kurtz,  and who  found the  &quot;Deryni Christian&quot;  archetype a
          valid spiritual  expression.  The principal  result  so far  has  been
          liturgical expression pursued wherever enough of us can be found. 

                  Locally I amaffiliated with atemple of the SangrealSodality, a
          non-sectarian, decentralized, and frighteningly  eclectic organization
          following the  broad tradition of  the Golden Dawnand  its successors,
          and  drawing inspiration  and initation  from the  work of  William G.
          Gray. 


                                                                             945
