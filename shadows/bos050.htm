<center><h1>Lammas: The First Harvest</h1><h4>by Mike Nichols</h4></center>


<ul>Once upon a Lammas Night
<ul>When corn rigs are bonny,<br>
Beneath the Moon's unclouded light,<br>
I held awhile to Annie...</ul></ul>


<p>Although in the heat of a Mid-western summer it might be difficult to discern, the festival
of Lammas (Aug 1st) marks the end of summer and the beginning of fall. The days now grow visibly
shorter and by the time we've reached autumn's end (Oct 31st), we will have run the gamut of
temperature from the heat of August to the cold and (sometimes) snow of November. And in the
midst of it, a perfect Mid-western autumn.</p>

<p>The history of Lammas is as convoluted as all the rest of the old folk holidays. It is of
course a cross-quarter day, one of the four High Holidays or Greater Sabbats of Witchcraft,
occurring 1/4 of a year after Beltane. It's true astrological point is 15 degrees Leo, which
occurs at 1:18 am CDT, Aug 6th this year (1988), but tradition has set August 1st as the day
Lammas is typically celebrated. The celebration proper would begin on sundown of the previous
evening, our July 31st, since the Celts reckon their days from sundown to sundown.</p>

<p>However, British Witches often refer to the astrological date of Aug 6th as Old Lammas, and
folklorists call it Lammas O.S. ('Old Style'). This date has long been considered a 'power point'
of the Zodiac, and is symbolized by the Lion, one of the 'tetramorph' figures found on the Tarot
cards, the World and the Wheel of Fortune (the other three figures being the Bull, the Eagle, and
the Spirit). Astrologers know these four figures as the symbols of the four 'fixed' signs of the
Zodiac, and these naturally align with the four Great Sabbats of Witchcraft. Christians have
adopted the same iconography to represent the four gospel-writers.</p>

<p>'Lammas' was the medieval Christian name for the holiday and it means 'loaf-mass', for this
was the day on which loaves of bread were baked from the first grain harvest and laid on the
church altars as offerings. It was a day representative of 'first fruits' and early harvest.</p>

<p>In Irish Gaelic, the feast was referred to as 'Lugnasadh', a feast to commemorate the funeral
games of the Irish sun-god Lugh. However, there is some confusion on this point. Although at
first glance, it may seem that we are celebrating the death of the Lugh, the god of light does
not really die (mythically) until the autumnal equinox. And indeed, if we read the Irish myths
closer, we discover that it is not Lugh's death that is being celebrated, but the funeral games
which Lugh hosted to commemorate the death of his foster-mother, Taillte. That is why the
Lugnasadh celebrations in Ireland are often called the 'Tailltean Games'.</p>


<ul>The time went by with careless heed
<ul>Between the late and early,<br>
With small persuasion she agreed<br>
To see me through the barley...</ul></ul>


<p>One common feature of the Games were the 'Tailltean marriages, a rather informal marriage that
lasted for only 'a year and a day' or until next Lammas. At that time, the couple could decide to
continue the arrangement if it pleased them, or to stand back to back and walk away from one
another, thus bringing the Tailltean marriage to a formal close. Such trial marriages (obviously
related to the Wiccan 'Handfasting') were quite common even into the 1500's, although it was
something one 'didn't bother the parish priest about'. Indeed, such ceremonies were usually
solemnized by a poet, bard or shanachie (or, it may be guessed, by a priest or priestess of the
Old Religion).</p>

<p>Lammastide was also the traditional time of year for craft festivals. The medieval guilds
would create elaborate displays of their wares, decorating their shops and themselves in bright
colors and ribbons, marching in parades, and performing strange, ceremonial plays and dances
for the entranced onlookers. The atmosphere must have been quite similar to our modern-day
Renaissance Festivals, such as the one celebrated in near-by Bonner Springs, Kansas, each fall.</p>

<p>A ceremonial highlight of such festivals was the 'Catherine wheel'. Although the Roman Church
moved St. Catherine's feast day all around the calender with bewildering frequency, it's most
popular date was Lammas. (They also kept trying to expel this much-loved saint from the ranks of
the blessed because she was mythical rather than historical, and because her worship gave rise to
the heretical sect known as the Cathari.) At any rate, a large wagon wheel was taken to the top 
of a near-by hill, covered with tar, set aflame, and ceremoniously rolled down the hill. Some
mythologists see in this ritual the remnants of a Pagan rite symbolizing the end of summer, the
flaming disk representing the sun-god in his decline. And just as the sun king has now reached
the autumn of his years, his rival or dark self has just reached puberty.</p>

<p>Many commentators have bewailed the fact that traditional Gardnerian and Alexandrian Books of
Shadows say very little about the holiday of Lammas, stating only that poles should be ridden and
a circle dance performed. This seems strange, for Lammas is a holiday of rich mythic and
cultural associations, providing endless resources for liturgical celebration.</p>


<ul>Corn rigs and barley rigs,
<ul>Corn rigs are bonny!<br>
I'll not forget that happy night<br>
Among the rigs with Annie!</ul></ul>
