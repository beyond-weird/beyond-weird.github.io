                   WORLD HEALING MEDITATION  By John Randolph Price
     In the beginning
     In the beginning God
     In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
     And God said Let there be light; and there was light.
     Now is the time of the new beginning.
     I am a co-creator with God, and it is a new Heaven that comes.
     as the God Will of God is expressed on Earth through me.
     It the Kingdom of Light, Love, Peace, and Understanding.
     And I am doing my part to reveal its Reality.
     I begin with me.
     I am a living Soul and the Spirit of God dwells in me, as me.
     I and the Father are one, and all that the Father has is mine.
     In Truth, I am the Christ in God.
     What is true of me is true of everyone, for God is all and all is God.
     I see only the Spirit of God in every Soul.
     And to every man woman and child on Earth I say:
     I love you, for you are me. You are my Holy Self!
     I now open my heart.
     and let the pure essence of Unconditional Love pour out.
     I see it as a Golden Light radiating from the center of my being.
     and I feel its Divine Vibration in and through me, above and below me.
     I am one with the Light.
     I am filled with the Light.
     I am illumined by the Light.
     I am the Light of the world.
     With purpose of mind, I sends forth the Light.
     I let the radiance go before me to join the other Lights.
     I know this is happening all over the world at this moment.
     I see the merging Lights.
     There is now one Light. We are the Light of the world.
     The one Light of Love, Peace, and Understanding is moving.
     It flows across the face of the Earth,
     touching and illuminating every soul in the shadow of the illusion.
     And where there was darkness, there is now the Light of Reality.
     And the Radiance grows, permeating, saturating every form of life.
     There is only the vibration of one Perfect Life now.
     All the kingdoms of the Earth respond, and the Planet is alive with
      Light and Love.
     There is total Oneness, and in this Oneness we speak the Word.
     Let the sense of separation be dissolved.
     Let mankind be returned to Godkind.
     Let peace come forth in every mind.
     Let Love flow forth from every heart.
     Let forgiveness reign in every soul.
     Let understanding be the common bond.
     And now from the Light of the world.
     the One Presence and Power of the Universe responds.
     The Activity of God is healing and harmonizing Planet Earth.
     Omnipotence is made manifest.
     I am seeing the salvation of the planet before my very eyes.
     as all false beliefs and error patterns are dissolved.
     The sense of separation is no more; the healing has taken place,
     and the world is restored to sanity.
     This is the beginning of Peace on Earth and Good Will toward all,
     as Love flows forth from every heart, forgiveness reigns in every soul,
     and all hearts and minds are one in perfect understanding.
     It is done. And it is so.

                                                                             662
