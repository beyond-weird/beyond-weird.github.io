                                                   MAY EVE 

            Walpurgis Night, the time is right,
            The ancient powers awake.
            So dance and sing, around the ring,
            And Beltane magic make.

            Walpurgis Night, Walpurgis Night,
            Upon the eve of May,
            We'll merry meet, and summer greet,
            For ever and a day.

            New life we see, in flower and tree,
            And summer comes again.
            Be free and fair, like earth and air,
            The sunshine and the rain.

            Walpurgis Night, Walpurgis Night,
            Upon the eve of May,
            We'll merry meet, and summer greet,
            For ever and a day.



          As magic fire be our desire
            To tread the pagan way,
            And our true will find and fulfil,
            As dawns a brighter day.

            Walpurgis Night, Walpurgis Night,
            Upon the eve of May,
            We'll merry meet, and summer greet,
            For ever and a day.

            The pagan powers this night be ours,
            Let all the world be free,
            And sorrows cast into the past,
            And future blessed be!

            Walpurgis Night, Walpurgis Night,
            Upon the eve of May,
            We'll merry meet, and summer greet,
            For ever and a day.
