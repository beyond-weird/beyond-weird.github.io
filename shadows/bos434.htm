                                 Charge of The Horned God 
                                          V. West

          Hark unto me: for I am  He who has existed throughout all time.  I was
          there from the beginning; it was my potency that charged the fertility
          of the Great Mother and created life from her empty womb.

                          Myself itis inthewinds thatsweep theworlds;myself itis
          in  the flames that give warmth  and light to all beings.  I am he who
          provides: the Green Man of field and forest fruitfulness; the  lust of
          the bull  that engenders life upon  the cow; the strength  of the boar
          that engenders life upon the sacred sow of Ceriddwen; the speed of the
          stag running free in the  forest that no hunter can bring down save he
          who speaks the  sacred words to  call unto the  spirit of the  fleeing
          stag.

                          I am Lord of theDance; he who swirls throughthe starry
          universe  with the world at his heels.  I am he who dances on mountain
          and plain and hearth, and he who captures all things in his dance.

                          AndI amalso KernnuntheDark Hunter;he withvisage asdark
          as void and armour bright with flame. My name is Lord  of the Hunt; my
          prey those souls who needs must die and descend into the dark, chthon-
          ic depths of my bowel. For I bring life but death also; I am he at the
          gateway of the worlds, and to me shalt thou  come in the end, thou who
          art my child and my prey.
          .
                                          (written November 1989)
