     The Henge of Keltria--a Neo-pagan Druidic organization

     What is The Henge of Keltria?

     The Henge of Keltria is a positive path Druidic tradition
     dedicated to protecting the Earth, honoring our ancestors,
     revering the spirits of nature and worshipping the Keltic
     Deities.  Our focus is on spiritual development achieved through
     the study and practice of the Druidic Arts and Keltic Magick.
     Through training, networking, resources, ritual and
     communications we strive to provide a religious and spiritual
     framework through which each individual can reach his of her own
     full potential.

     What does the Henge offer?

     Currently the Henge of Keltria Publishes &quot;Keltria: A Journal of
     Druidism and Keltic Magick&quot; on a quarterly basis, and an
     introductory 31 page booklet &quot;The Henge: An Introduction to
     Keltrian Druidism.&quot;  Classes in neo-pagan Druidism are offered
     in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area on an ongoing basis.
     Campouts and workshops are held on an irregular basis in
     Northwestern Wisconsin.  Future plans include a book of ritual,
     bardic songbook, correspondence courses, theological journal and
     membership directory.
