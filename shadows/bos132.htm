     .     This following is  an excerpt from &quot;Psi  Notes&quot;, prepared by  William
     Braud, Ph.D., of the Mind Science Foundation in San Antonio, Texas.

     Question:   What percentage of a person's dreams are precognitive (foretell
     the future) and how  can we recognize the difference between a precognitive
     dream and an ordinary dream?

     Answer:    A large  proportion  of  precognitive  experiences occur  during
     dreams.   One survey indicates that  as many as 65  percent of precognitive
     experiences  occurred  during sleep.    Precognitive  dreams also  seem  to
     provide  more complete and more accurate information than do waking psychic
     experiences.

     .   There's no way to know with certainty what percentage of our dreams are
     precognitive.  The content of the majority of our dreams is probably quite
     mundane, involving replays of experiences of the day, perhaps some wish
     fulfillment, and maybe  even &quot;random&quot; content.  But now  and then, dreamers
     do have accurate glimpses of the future as they sleep.

     .    The only way to know  with certainty which dreams are precognitive and
     which are not is to keep a dream diary of all dreams and check to see which
     come true  and which  don't.   Some persons are  able to  associate certain
     feelings of confidence  in connection with psychic  dreams - but these  are
     very subtle  feelings which are difficult  to put into words  and which may
     differ from person to person.

     .    Let me describe  a program of  research in which  we are more  certain
     about what's going on.  This research program was initiated by a New York
     psychiatrist, Dr. Montague Ullman, as  a result of his observation that  he
     and  his  patients  were  sharing  telepathic  dreams  in  the  context  of
     psychotherapy.   A dream laboratory was set up at Maimonides Medical Center
     in  Brooklyn.   Ullman,  along with  his  associates Stanley  Krippner  and
     Charles  Honorton, designed experiments in which persons spent the night in
     the dream lab.   They  were monitored electro-physiologically  in order  to
     detect physiological  indications of dreaming -  these indications include:
     an activated EEG, rapid  eye movements, and  reduced muscle tension.   When
     these  indications of dreaming occurred, the sleeper was awakened and asked
     to describe his  dream.   These descriptions were  tape-recorded and  later
     transcribed.  The  next day, a target experience was  randomly selected and
     the  subject then went  through some waking  sensory experience.   What was
     discovered  was that  the sleeper was  able to  have accurate  dreams about
     events of which no one was as yet aware at the time of the dream, but which
     were randomly selected the next day.


                                                                             577
