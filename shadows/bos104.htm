                         CANDLE MAGIC

          1    One of the simplest of magical arts which comes under 
          the heading of natural magic is candle burning.  It is simple 
          because it employs little ritual and few ceremonial 
          artifacts.  The theatrical props of candle magic can be 
          purchased at any department store and its rituals can be 
          practiced in any sitting room or bedroom.

          2    Most of us have performed our first act of candle magic 
          by the time we are two years old.  Blowing out the tiny 
          candles on our first birthday cake and making a wish is pure 
          magic.  This childhood custom is based on the three magical 
          principals of concentration, will power and visualization.  
          In simple terms, the child who wants his wish to come true 
          has to concentrate (blow out the candles), visualize the end 
          result (make a wish) and hope that it will come true( will 
          power).

          3    The size and shape of the candles you use is 
          unimportant, although highly decorative, extra large, or 
          unusually shaped candles will not be suitable as these may 
          create distractions when the magician wants to concentrate on 
          the important work in hand.  Most magicians prefer to use 
          candles of standard or uniform size if possible.  Those which 
          are sold in different colors for domestic use are ideal.

          4    The candles you use for any type of magical use should 
          be virgin, that is unused.  Under no circumstances use a 
          candle which has already adorned a dinner table or been used 
          as a bedroom candle or night-light.  There is a very good 
          occult reason for not using anything but virgin materials in 
          magic.  Vibrations picked up by secondhand materials or 
          equipment may disturb your workings and negate their 
          effectiveness.

          5    Some magicians who are artistically inclined prefer to
          make their own candles for ritual and magical use.  This is a 
          very practical exercise because not only does it impregnate 
          the candle with your own personal vibrations, but the mere 
          act of making your own candle is magically potent.  
          Specialist shops sell candle wax and molds together with 
          wicks, perfumes, and other equipment.

          6    The hot wax is heated until liquid and then poured into 
          the mould through which a suitably sized wick has already 
          been threaded.  The wax is then left to cool and once is this 
          has occurred the mould is removed , leaving a perfectly formed 
          candle.  Special oil-soluble dyes and perfumes can be added 
          to the wax before the cooling process is complete to provide 
          suitable colors and scents for a particular magical ritual.  
          Craft shops which sell candlemaking supplies can also provide 
          do-it-yourself books explaining the technicalities of the art 
          to the beginner.

                                                                             417

          7    Once you have purchased or made your ritual candle it 
          has to be oiled or 'dressed' before burning.  The purpose of 
          dressing the candle is to establish a psychic link between it 
          and the magician through a primal sensory experience.  By 
          physically touching the candle during the dressing 
          procedure, you are charging it with our own personal 
          vibrations and also concentrating the desire of your magical 
          act into the wax.  The candle is becoming an extension of the 
          magician's mental power and life energy.

          8    When you dress a candle for magical use, imagine that
          it is a psychic magnet with a North and a South pole.  Rub 
          the oil into the candle beginning at the top or North end and 
          work downwards to the half-way point.  Always brush in the 
          same direction downwards.  This process is then repeated by 
          beginning at the bottom or south end and working up to the 
          middle.

          9    The best type of oils to use for dressing candles are 
          natural ones which can be obtained quite easily.  Some occult 
          suppliers will provide candle magic oils with exotic names.  
          If the magician does not want to use these, he can select 
          suitable oils or perfumes from his own sources.  The oils 
          soluble perfumes sold by craft shops for inclusion in candles 
          can be recommended.

          10   the candles you use can be colored in accordance with 
          the following magical uses:

                   white- spirituality and peace.
                   red- health,energy,strength,courage, sexual potency.
                   pink- love affection and romance.
                   yellow- intellectualism, imagination, memory and 
                           creativity
                   green- fertility, abundance, good luck and harmony
                   blue-inspiration, occult wisdom, protection and 
                         devotion
                   purple Material wealth, higher psychic ability, 
                          spiritual power and idealism
                   silver- clairvoyance, inspiration, astral energy and 
                          intuition
                   orange- ambition. career matters and the law.

          11   If you wanted to use candle magic for healing, you would 
          select a red candle to burn.  To pass an exam, burn a yellow 
          candle, to gain esoteric knowledge burn a blue candle or for 
          material gain, burn a purple one.  It is obvious these
          colors relate to the signs of the zodiac and the planetary 
          forces.

          12   The simples form of candle magic is to write doesn't the 
          objective of your ritual on a virgin piece of paper.  You 
          can use color paper which matches the candle.  Write your 
          petition on the paper using a magical alphabet, such as 
          theban, enochian, malachain,etc.  As you write down what you 
          want to accomplish through candle magic-- a new job, healing 
          for a friend, a change of residence, a new love affair, 
          etc.-- visualize your dream coming true.  Visualize the 
          circumstances under which you might be offered a new job, 
          imagine your employer telling you that your salary has been 
          increased or conjure up a vision of your perfect love 
          partner.

          13   When you have completed writing down your petitio, 
          carefully fold up the paper in a deliberately slow fashion.  
          Place the end of the folded paper in the candle flame and set 
          light to it.  As you do this concentrate once more on what 
          you want from life.

          14   When you have completed your ritual, allow the candle to 
          have completely burned away.  You do not need to stay with 
          the candle after the ritual, but make sure that is safe 
          and that red-hot wax will not cause damage or fire.  Never 
          re-use a candle which has been lit in any magical ritual.  IT 
          should only be used in that ritual and then allowed to burn 
          away or be disposed of afterwards.

          15   If you are conducting a magical ritual which involves 
          two people (e.g. an absent healing for a person some distance 
          away) then the  second person can be symbolically 
          represented during the ritual by another candle.  /all you 
          need to do is find out the subject's birth date and burn the 
          appropriate candle for that zodiacal sign.  These are as 
          follows-
                   ARIES                 red
                   TAURUS                green
                   GEMINI                yellow
                   CANCER                silver
                   LEO                   orange
                   VIRGO                 yellow
                   LIBRA                 pink
                   SCORPIO               red
                   SAGITARIUS            purple
                   CAPRICORN             black
                   AQUARIUS              all colors
                   PISCES                mauve
