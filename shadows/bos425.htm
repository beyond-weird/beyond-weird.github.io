                                                  ELEMENTS 

            Fire on Fire
            Light and Power, 
            Warmth and Energy
            They did generate.

            Earth joined them then
            To Life She gave Birth
            And solid Foundations built.

            Along came Water
            Some Channels to carve
            Through which all Energies flow.

            Around them All
            The Air did blow
            Winds of Thought and Deed
            intertwined.

            Power raised, Power spread
            Thus It Was
            So Mote It Be.       .....Alernon
