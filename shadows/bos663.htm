                          Charge of the God 1 
                             By: Siobhan 
                          Tue 12 Jul 94 10:33

Here's something I picked up recently. The writer felt that there should
be a Charge of the God to go with The Charge of the Goddess.
                *****
     Listen the the words of the Great Father, who of old was called
Osiris, Adonis, Zeus, Thor, Pan, Cernunnos, Herne, Lugh and by may other
names:
    &quot;My Law is Harmony with all things.  Mine is the secret that opens
the gates of life and mine is the dish of salt of the earth that is the
body of Cernunnos that is the eternal circle of rebirth.  I give the
knowledge of life everlasting, and beyond death I give the promise of
regeneration and renewal.  I am the sacrifice, the father of all things,
and my protection blankets the earth.&quot;
     Hear the words of the dancing God, the music of whose laughter
stirs the winds, whose voice calls the seasons:
    &quot;I who am the Lord of the Hunt and the Power of the Light, sun among
the clouds and the secret of the flame, I call upon your bodies to arise
and come unto me.  For I am the flesh of the earth and all it's beings.
Thru me all things must die and with me are reborn.  Let my worship be
in the body that sings, for behold all acts of willing sacrifice are my
rituals.  Let there be desire and fear, anger and weakness, joy and
peace, awe and longing within you.  For these too are part of the
mysteries found within yourself, within me, all beginnings have endings,
and all endings have beginnings.&quot;
So Mote It BE!

                          Charge of the God 2 
                             By: Siobhan 
                          Tue 12 Jul 94 10:33

This is the second Charge of the God I have.
                ****

THE CHARGE OF THE GOD

Listen to the words of the God, who is the son, brother, lover, and
consort of the Lady:

I am the fleet deer in the forest, I am the beach which receives the
waves, I am the sun which warms the earth. I am the Lord of the
Spiral Dance of Life, Death and Rebirth, the gentle reaper, the
Winter stag and the Spring fawn. All things are of me, for I am of
the Goddess, opposite, yet not opposing. I bring birth forth from the
womb that is a tomb, for I am the seed which fertilizes. I am
abundant Life, for I am the grain that grows and I am death, the
harvest in the Fall. And I am rebirth after darkness, for I am the
seed that springs forth anew.

I am fertility, the spreader of Life, and I am the Lord of Death,
which adds value to life.

I am the Guardian of the gate between Life and Death. I am King of
the Underworld, where no living being may venture, but I am also
the King of Rebirth, turning the tomb into a womb.

3314

I bring love and strength, peace and passion, hope and joy, for I am
the gentle lover in the night.

All that I am comes from the Great Mother, the Divine Star
Goddess, who is Mother of us all.

                **********

Feel free to use this one as is, or to adapt it in whatever way feels
right to you.

Blessed Be!
