                     Spell for contacting a friend 
                            Rowan Moonstone 
This spell should be used to cause someone with whom you have lost
contact to contact you.  It is not manipulation so much as an astral
call for contact when you have no other way to reach them that you know
of.

You will need:

White candle annointed w/ sandalwood oil
Sandalwood incense
photo of the person
small glass of water.
salt

Light the white candle and the incense.  Place the picture of the person
on your altar.  Put 2 heaping tablespoons of salt in the palm of your
right hand.  Let a small amount of salt trickle into the glass while
making the sign of the equal armed cross of the elements.  Make this
cross 3 times.  Say &quot; Call me&quot; three times as yo do this.  Then set the
glass on the altar and say &quot;Get in touch with me, please.&quot;  They
should contact you by the time the water has evaporated from the glass.
