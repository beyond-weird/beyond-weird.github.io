                            House Cleansing 
                            By: David Piper

************************************************************************
              _Banishing And Sealing Ritual For The Home_

To be performed during at the New Moon, but may be performed at any time
in need.

You will need a new white Candle (any size with holder), small bowls for
Water and Salt, and a large bowl of water as well, and the censer and an
appropriate incense.  (Choose one that brings to your mind qualities you
wish to have in your home.)


Banishing Ritual:

Meditate for a few moments on the task ahead; then make a brief
invocation to the Goddess and the God, asking for Their Aid and Power in
the Work you will do.

Light the white candle in its holder, and charcoal in the censer (or an
incense stick may be used instead).

Consecrate Water and Salt in the usual way.

Consecrate the water in the bowl in the same manner, but do not add
Salt; place this bowl in the center of the room.

Take the consecrated Water, elevate it to North, and say,

        &quot;In the name of (Goddess) and (God)
         I banish with Water and Earth.&quot;

Sprinkle the Water lightly widdershins around the perimeter of the room.

Bless the incense, then elevate the censer (or incense stick) to North,
and say,

        &quot;In the name of (Goddess) and (God)
         I banish with Fire and Air.&quot;

Cense the perimeter of the room widdershins.

Take the Candle and cast a Banishing Earth Pentagram at North.  (Draw
the Pentagram with the censer or incense stick, starting from the bottom
left point up to the top point, and so forth.)  As you cast the
Pentagram say,

        &quot;With this Sign I banish ye, foul shades of the (Quarter)!
         Let this home be freed of your baneful influences!&quot;

Then go widdershins around the perimeter of the room, casting a
Banishing Pentagram at each Quarter beginning at the West and ending
back at North, repeating the above at each Quarter.  (Do not repeat it
again at North.)

Now turn and face the center of the room, where the bowl of water sits.

With your hands, draw any negative energy or vibrations remaining, and
cast them into the water in the bowl by flicking or snapping your
fingers at it.  Repeat this action until you are satisfied the room is
cleansed.  Do not touch the water in the bowl, as it is being filled
with the negative forces you are eliminating.

Move the consecrated Water, the Salt, the Incense, the Candle, and
the bowl of water (being careful not to spill it) into each room in
your home and repeat this ritual.

After banishing every room in the home (including bathroom, closets,
pantry, etc.) you have finished.  Empty the large bowl of water into
running water (a sink or toilet will do).  Wash the bowl thoroughly
with cold water, scrubbing with some of the consecrated Salt.


Sealing Ritual:

Take all the Elemental substances used in the Banishing Ritual (Salt,
consecrated Water, wax drippings from the Candle, and ashes from the
Incense) and mix them into a paste.

Using your forefinger, use the mixture to draw an Invoking Fire
Pentagram at each opening leading outside the home (the doors and the
windows - and even the water pipes, if you should feel the need) while
concentrating on the Intention of protecting your home from outside
influences.  (Draw the Pentagram from the top point to the bottom right,
and so forth.  Form the Star so that it is point up, or point out, as
appropriate.)  You may make two Stars at each opening if you wish - one
on the sill or threshold, and the other on the door or window itself.

Remember that Intent is the key to success in this, as in all magickal
operations; going through the motions without Will brings no results.
