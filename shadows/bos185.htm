     A Circle Purification that doesn't use Incense: 
     for asthmatics, those with allergies, and those with other pulmonary 
     disorders 
     by Matrika, co-sysop of 
     PAN- the Psychic Awareness Network, 300/1200/2400 baud at 1-703-362-1139 
      
     This ritual was inspired when someone in our circle back in Central 
     Massachusetts started dating a young woman who was a great herbalist, 
     knowledgeable about crystal healing, a competent tarot-reader and a 
     beginning astrologer.  She had read &quot;Spiral Dance&quot; by Starhawk on the Craft
     of the Wise (Wicca) and wore a pentagram around her neck, but couldn't try 
     circle work because she was allergic to smoke and had a serious asthma 
     problem. 
      
     So, heres the rite.  You prepare your altar as usual, with the exception of
     the incense and incense burner.  5 non-electric pot-pouri burners filled 
     with water and an appropriately scented pot-pouri should be on or near the 
     altar with 5 candles.  Be sure that you use the correct type of candles for
     your pot-pouri burners, as other types can destroy the burners.  Put these 
     on the altar, which should be at the center of the circle and facing North 
     or East according to your custom.  If they do not fit without obstructing 
     the work, place them in a semi-circle at the foot of the altar.  Have 
     matches there to light the candles under them at the proper time. 
      
     The rite 
     (Leader 1 should be a male, if possible.  Leader 2 should be a female, if 
     possible.) 
      
     Leader 1 - blessing the water and herbal mixture in each pot-pouri burner 
     with the wand.  a long-stem rose with the thorns removed can be used for a 
     wand if you do not yet have one.  Of course, this must be replaced each 
     time you do a ritual - 
     &quot;By Fire and By Air 
     By Water and by Earth 
     by the Lady and the Lord 
     I conjure thee to purify our circle this night&quot; 
      
     all- &quot; So mote it be&quot; 
      
     He takes one of the burners and the matches to the North where he lights 
     it.  Leader 2 accompanies him with her wand, after he lights it she raises 
     her wand and says 
      
     Leader 2 - &quot;By fire and air 
     By water and by earth 
     Let us purify the 
     Northern Quarter of our circle&quot; 
      


                                                                             782

     There is a pause during which everyone visualizes (vividly imagining in 
     every detail from a relaxed, meditative state) an arc of rainbow light 
     forming that quarter of the circle then, when she lowers the wand, everyone
     responds. 
     all - &quot;So Mote It Be&quot; 
      
     Leader 1 returns to the central altar and gets the next  burner, placing it
     in the East and  lighting it.  Leader 2 continues in the same way as above.
     This procedure is then repeated in the South and then in the West.  Each 
     time the invocation is changed to reflect the direction they are in.   Each
     time the group visualizes the rainbow arc of light.  And after each 
     direction,  Leader 1 returns to the center to get the burner for the next 
     direction ready.  By constantly returning to the center each time, the 
     emphasis is placed there.  After the Western quarter is lit, Leader 1 
     places the final burner on the altar, between the candles, where the 
     incense burner would be if there was one and lights it.  Leader 2 stands 
     before the altar, raises her wand and says 
     Leader 2 - &quot;By Fire and by air 
     By water and by earth 
     Let us purify the sacred center of our circle 
     where Heaven and Earth Unite 
     and 
     Where the Lord and Lady are joined in love.&quot; 
      
     While her wand is raised, everyone visualizes the rainbow light from the 
     outer circles flooding in to the center and filling the circle with 
     harmonious vibrations and energies.  After a few moments, she lowers her 
     wand and everyone responds. 
     all- &quot;SO mote it be&quot; 
      
     The circle casting is continued as usual with the invocations of the 
     elements at the 4 corners, according to your tradition.  Then the actual 
     circle-casting is done as usual.  After this do whatever rite and/or magick
     you would usually do and close in the usual manner.  Be sure to snuff the 
     candles and not to blow them out.  Use a silver teaspoon to do this, if you
     don't have a snuffer.  This ceremony ONLY replaces the part of the rite 
     where you sprinkle with salt-water and then cense the circle to purify it 
     in PREPARATION for the actual circle casting.  It is NOT the full casting 
     of the circle.  (Some traditions purify with all 4 elements separately, 
     sprinkling salt on the floor for earth, water on the floor for itself, 
     censing the circle for air, and carrying a candle around for fire.   Either
     way this rite replaces the elemental purification, as the burners embody 
     all 4 elements - the water for itself, the candle for fire, the herbs for 
     earth, and the scent the steam gives off for air.) 
      
     OF course the pot-pouri burners used for this should only be used in your 
     psychic work and should have been consecrated or smudged (by someone who 
     can deal with the smoke) in preparation for this ritual. 
      


                                                                             783

     To prepare appropriate pot-pouri scents for the  purpose of your rites, use
     the directions for making the various home-made herbal incenses traditional
     in Witchcraft and in Magick; however,  don't grind them with a mortar and 
     pestle as you would in making incense.  If you do not know the  recipes for
     these, any of the Scott Cuningham books on making incenses would provide 
     them for you.  They are available from Llewelyn Publishing, box 64383 St. 
     Paul Minnesota. (They will send you a free catalogue on request) 
      
     Despite the initial cost involved in obtaining the 5 burners,  it is highly
     suggested you do it that way for two reasons&quot; 
     1.  In anything but a very small and enclosed space, you will not get 
     enough scent to represent the air element sufficiently for magickal and 
     ritual working. 
     and 
     2.  To represent all 4 elements in EACH of the quarters and in the center 
     of the circle is very important in establishing the traditional boundaries 
     between the worlds (the ordinary and non-ordinary or shamanic realities) 
     that is the purpose of casting the circle and creating sacred space. 
      
     ALSO IF YOU TRY TO CARRY A POT-POURI BURNER THAT IS LIT AND HOT ENOUGH TO 
     BE GIVING OFF THE SCENTED STEAM AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE CIRCLE, YOU 
     WILL CERTAINLY BURN YOUR FINGERS BADLY.  (It  is not appropriate to bring a
     pot holder into circle to carry it either! PLEASE!) 
      
     I hope this is helpful to those who have breathing problems and wish to 
     perform magick.
