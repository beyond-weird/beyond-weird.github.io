<H1>Circles, why use them?</H1>
<H4>Mel White</H4>
</CENTER>
<P>They say that the longest journey begins with a single step. So, too,
the exploration of Magickal studies begins with a single step. Though
the first step in a physical journey is often self-evident, the First
Step on a Magickal journey is often not quite so clear. While
formally organized groups often have a path of lessons to instruct
newcomers, the solitary or isolated student is often left standing in
perplexity on this broad plain of knowledge, wondering just where in
the heck to begin. And wondering, too, if it's &quot;okay&quot; to start just
anywhere.</P>

<P>While it's true that studies can begin in any direction that attracts
you, the necessary first step must be learning to make psychic
shields. There are &quot;Things of the Dark&quot; out there. There are any
number of explanations for what these things might be -- ghosts,
demons, or simply uncontrolled urges of the subconscious mind. In
truth, it doesn't matter what they are. What does matter is that their
effect is very real and unless they are put under your control, they
will drag you over the borders of sanity into psychosis. You are most
vulnerable to them while you're in an &quot;open&quot; trance or meditative
state. That's why the wise practitioner always begins by taking steps
to define exactly what will be permitted through the portals of their
&quot;psychic shields&quot; -- no matter how simple the ritual. And this, in 
a nutshell, is what &quot;protective magic&quot; is about.</P>

<P>There are a number of ways to do this. The most common is to begin by
drawing a circle (around a group or yourself) and invoking the one or
more protective powers. Generally, this is done by candlelight, in
front of an altar that holds certain magical objects. The circle may
be further &quot;secured&quot; and &quot;cleared&quot; by using salt, salt water, rum,
incense, or some other method. You may be wearing a special robe and
will have taken a bath (or performed a cleansing ritual) earlier. The
powers that protect you will be called on and <I>then</I> you will begin your
ritual.</P>

<P>Is it psychological? Absolutely! Is there a reason why protection
rituals always take this form? Positively! Let's take a step back
and see what you're actually doing and how the process works -- from a
psychological standpoint -- and how to use this knowledge to help you
refine your circles to enhance your rituals.</P>

<P>Psychologists and psychics alike view the mind's structure as a
three-part entity: The Ego (that which you think of as yourself), the
Superego (the &quot;higher self&quot;) and the Id (the child within). The Id
is, in a sense, a computer. Like most computers, it operates on the GIGO
(Garbage In, Garbage Out) principle. There's an old superstition: &quot;As
you name something, so will it become.&quot; Tell yourself that you're very
unlucky and your Id will obligingly give you bad days by enhancing any
negatives in your environment. Tell yourself that you are clumsy, and
your Id-computer will obligingly arrange for you to break a leg while
stepping off the sidewalk. The bad news is that the Id can't make a
judgement as to whether or not this is a good idea. It only knows
that it's received these &quot;instructions&quot; and must carry them out. The
good news is that you can actually program/reprogram this portion of
your mind.</P>

<P>You begin programming this Internal Servant of yours by first drawing
its attention to what you want done and then explaining what you need
done in a simple and clear manner. Repeating the instructions in a
chant help fix the goals for the Id -- rhymed chants seem to be easier
for it to process. Each time you perform the ritual and repeat the
chant, the programming is strengthened. Never mind that your ego and
superego understand that you're going to program the child-like Id.
It works just the same.</P>

<P>To direct the Id's attention to the process, you first have to impress
it. Using special tools and clothing alert it that something unusual
is going on and that it must pay attention. Acquiring hard-to-obtain
items, drawing symbols, performing a symbolic sacrifice (donating
money, say, to a good cause) are all ways of reinforcing the Id's
impression that this ceremony is very special and that the result will
be very powerful. Organized, meaningful symbols, speak to your
subconscious mind in ways it understands, reinforcing the goals you
have set.</P>

<P>Drawing the circle itself establishes boundaries within your
environment (&quot;The rest of the world can do what it likes Out There.
All within this circle is in <I>my</I> control!&quot;). Purifying the circle and
consecrating it (sprinkling water which has been blessed and salt
added) further enforce your territory, defining the borders where you
are &quot;safe&quot;. Nothing can enter this area except what you invite
inside. You further tighten these borders by calling on certain
Powers.</P>

<P>You can call on any powers you like. Some use traditional Christian
images. Others call up deities from the religion they are most
comfortable with. And many people use the thought/image of a beam of
light that represents either God/Goddess (whichever one they like) <I>or</I>
the power of light and life and goodness in the Universe.</P>

<P>The number of powers called as guardians varies. You may choose to
invoke one powerful being to protect your circle. Or you might call on
the Universal Being/Light <I>and</I> four guardians (one for each quarter of
the compass). A third approach is to use a guardian for the four
quarters of the compass and no higher being. There is no &quot;absolutely
correct&quot; system; the correct system is the one that </>you</I> are
comfortable with.</P>

<P>Take time to choose the guardians of your circle carefully. You
should select guardians (gods or animals or some form of life) which
have a deeper meaning to you and whose qualities are in harmony with
your goals. For the new student, it's best to have all your Powers and
Guardians from the same belief system/religion/mythic universe so that
the symbols will be consistent and not confuse the Id.</P>

<P>You <I>can</I> use people -- saints, movie actors, figures from favorite books
as guardians. Do, however, pick someone who's dead or non-existent.
The dead can't argue with your interpretation of them, whereas the
living may be highly offended to be approached as gods/guardians.</P>

<P>As your studies continue, you will find that your totems or guardians
change. This is to be expected; as you explore new realms in your
studies, you may find you need guardians who deal with very specific
areas to strengthen and guide you in these new fields.</P>

<P>But don't make the mistake of assuming that you'll become so powerful
that you will never need the protection of the psychic shielding
circle in some form. And don't assume that you will not need a circle
for &quot;positive&quot; magicks such as healing. Open is open -- and open is
vulnerable. And circles strengthen and protect you by defining what
psychological influences will be allowed to work with you.</P>
