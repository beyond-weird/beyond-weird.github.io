                       tune: Same Old Man/Leatherwing Bat 
             
                Hi said the Norn, sittin in the sand 
                once I talked to a great Grey Man 
                spun three times and said with a sigh 
                &quot;Hadn't been for the Runes had his other eye!&quot; 
             
             Chorus: hi diddle i diddle i day 
                    hi diddle i diddle i diddle ay 
                    hi di diddle i diddle i day 
                    fol the dink a dum diddle do di day 
             
                Hi said the Lady, dressed in green 
                prettiest thing I've ever seen 
                she went down underneath the hill 
                and came back out of her own free will 
             
                Brian Boru, on Irish ground 
                walked three times the Island round 
                Norsemen came lookin for a fight 
                just another Irish Saturday night! 
             
                Hi said Lugh on the banquest night 
                a poet and a player and a good wheelwright 
                a harper and a warrior and none the least: 
                a Druid and he got in to the Feast! 
             
                Harold Haardrada's face was red! 
                Came to Britain and he wound up dead 
                Stamford Bridge is where he's found 
                got six feet of English ground 
             
                The Legion with it's Eagles bright 
                marched into the Pictish night 
                met them there upon the sand 
                gave em up to the Wicker Man! 
             
                Eight-legged steed and hound of Hel 
                the one-eyed Man, he loves ya well 
                fire burn and fire spark 
                are you then feared of the dark? 
             
                The Circle forms, the Circle flows 
                the Circle goes where no man knows 
                Hail to the Lady, one in three: 
                Present is Past and Past is Me! 
             
                Rhiannon's Birds are still in flight 
                all thru the Day all thru the Night 
                Hail to the Lady, one in Three 
                Present is Past and Past is Thee! 
             

                                           1922
