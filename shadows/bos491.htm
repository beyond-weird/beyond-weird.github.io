                                           SONG
                                          by Vivienne West
                                          (after Taliessin)

                    I am the sunshine on the verdant greensward.
                      I am the Salmon that swims in the stream.
                      I am of coal buried deep in the mountain.
                       I am the Eagle that sees from the sky.
                      I am the myth in the mind of the mystic.
                      I am the Crow at the foot of the warrior.
                    I am the shield and the spear of the fighter.
                     I am the corn and the flower of the field.
                        I am the fire that blazes at Beltane.
                       I am the woman that rocketh the cradle.
                  I am the egg that will hatch in fresh well-water.
                        I am the Lizard that dances in ashes.
                   I am the woman whose breasts are the hillocks.
                     I am the old man whose gaze is of sunlight.
                      I was with Isis when bodies were broken.
                       I was with Arianrhod in her sky-castle.
                        I was the Mare when Epona did gallop.
                        Who but me is the wonder of rivulets?
                      Who but me is the strength of the storm?

                                                                            2254
