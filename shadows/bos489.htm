                  DISCOVERIES

                     by

             Katrina McNeal-Dezern
               August 15, 1993

          Walking down Life's road one day,
          I spied a path along the way,
          Small it was, and hard to see,
          But I just knew it was for me.

          I stepped on to that wondrous Way,
          What drew me there I cannot say,
          But there along that path I trod,
          Akin to the Goddess, akin to the God.

          Of course I did not know that then,
          I merely felt the power within;
          Sister to forests, plants, and trees,
          A part of Nature's Magesties!

          For many years I trod alone,
          Thinking all this was my own,
          For others did not seem to see,
          What was so obvious to me.

          Imagine, then my sheer surprise,
          When right before my very eyes,
          It was my fortune to discover,
          Another traveller, my own true lover!

          But still more wonders were in store,
          For on our path we found yet more,
          And now the way's no longer bare,
          We know that others travel there.

          Some to learn and some to teach,
          Some the heights of wisdom reach;
          Together we gather in trust and joy,
          All our resources to employ.

          To share the way we think and feel,
          To help each other grow and heal;
          How wondrous all this is to me,
          To have found a Spiritual Family!

                                                                            2252
