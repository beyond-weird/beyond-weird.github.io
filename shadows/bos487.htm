                                 Creation Mystery,Part II 
                                    By: The Whyte Bard

                  The Lord, and the Lady (and the Fool) were lonely. The All was
          not
          complete; there was none to keep them company, and laugh with them.
          There
          was none to know them, and none to be Their Children.
                  And the Lady said, &quot;Let us go forth and make Life upon the
          many
          worlds, that We may have Children, and a Family of Life within the
          MultiVerse. And let Us make them in Our image, and love and be loved
          in
          return.&quot;

                  And the Fool laughed, and asked, &quot;Shall it be so?&quot;
                  &quot;No,&quot; said the Sacred King.
                  And the Fool asked a second time, and said, &quot;Shall it be so?&quot;
                  &quot;Maybe,&quot; smiled the Youth.
                  And the Fool asked a third time, saying, &quot;Shall it be so?&quot;
                  &quot;Yes!&quot; said the Child.

                  And the Fool smiled, and said, &quot;If we do this thing, it shall
          be a
          wondrous thing indeed, for we shall make a Creature that shall have
          the Love
          of the Lady, and the Strength of the Lord, and a Curiousity to match
          Myself.
          It shall know Good and Evil, and Light and Darkness, and That which
          stands
          between them, and shall be very near and dear to us. It shall be ar-
          rogant,
          and willful, and cruel, but it shall also be kind, and gentle and
          loving. It
          shall be all things, and nothing at all.&quot;

                  And the Fool laughed, and asked, &quot;Shall it be so?&quot;
                  &quot;No,&quot; said Chaos.
                  And the Fool asked a second time, and said, &quot;Shall it be so?&quot;
                  &quot;Maybe,&quot; smiled Trickster.
                  And the Fool asked a third time, saying, &quot;Shall it be so?&quot;
                  &quot;Yes!&quot; said Prometheus.

                  The Fool took up the stuff of stars, that whispers thru the
          MultiVerse, and mixed it with the dry clay of earth, and mixed the
          substance
          thereby made with the waters of the sea, and the tears of the Maiden,
          and the
          birth-waters of the Mother, and the spittle of the Crone; wet it was
          with the
          blood of the Sacred King, and the sweat of the Youth, and the milk on
          the
          lips of the Child.

                  And the Fool laughed, and asked, &quot;Shall it be so?&quot;
                  &quot;No,&quot; said the Crone.
                  And the Fool asked a second time, and said, &quot;Shall it be so?&quot;
                  &quot;Maybe,&quot; smiled the Maiden.
                  And the Fool asked a third time, saying, &quot;Shall it be so?&quot;
                  &quot;Yes!&quot; said the Mother.


                  And the Fool smiled, and said, &quot;Then let it be so, for I have
          asked
          three times, and three times three, and thus it is and so it ever
          shall be!&quot;
                  The Holy Fool bent, and sank to His knees, and She took the
          wet clay,
          wet with the waters of the sea, and the tears of the Maiden, and the
          birth-
          waters of the Mother, and the spittle of the Crone; wet with the blood
          of the
          Sacred King, and the sweat of the Youth, and the milk on the lips of
          the
          Child.
                  And from that clay He made our Brothers and Sisters in Fur,
          Feather
          and Scale, and all the growing things.
                  And one thing made of that clay was taken up by the Fool, and
          placed
          aside.
                  And the Lady smiled upon Her Lord.
                  And the Fool turned, and It was Prometheus, and shaped the wet
          clay
          thing further.
                  Side by side, He made them, that none should stand above the
          other,
          but that all should walk as equals and partners, in joy and love.
                  And the Fool turned, and It was Trickster, who shaped us to be
          curious, and to doubt, and from our doubt and curiousity, to learn,
          and to
          laugh.
                  And the Fool turned, and She was Chaos, and placed a bit of
          Itself
          within us, that we may change and grow.
                  And the Lord smiled upon His Lady.
                  Man and Woman Prometheus made, and the making and the shaping
          was as
          years, and years upon years.
                  And the Fool began to dance.
                  And the Lady began to dance.
                  And the Lord began to dance.
                  They danced Life into the World, the Lady and the Lord, and
          the Fool.
          They danced the moon, and stars, and Sun, and all that there is, they
          danced
          into being.
                  And they danced Death into the World, for we must close the
          Circle of
          our Being, and go forth unto newness.
                  They danced Life and Death, and still They dance, a never-en-
          ding,
          ever-spinning Circle, endlessly spiraling upon itself, and uncoiling
          to start
          anew; hand in hand They dance, to a Music They have made, endlessly
          creating,
          and endlessly destroying.

                  Thus it was, and so it is, and evermore shall be so!
