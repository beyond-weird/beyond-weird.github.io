I am often asked how one becomes a witch.  Do you find someone who is a
witch
and they make you one?  Or are you a witch just by saying you are?  Can you
make yourself a witch?</P>
<P>

The process of becoming a witch doesn't happen overnight.  It is a life
change, a new path upon the journey of your life.  It takes consideration,
study and work.  If you have previously followed a mainstream religion, you
may have things that take time to let go, and new things that take time to
absorb. I have heard many people say it is often hard, coming from a life of

Christianity, to feel comfortable praying to the Goddess. All new things
take
time, but if you are serious upon this path, you will find your way.  The
Gods call their own home to them.</P>
<P>

No matter how you have came about finding the Old Religion, here you are.
 So
where do you go?  To the book store.  For a novice, books are like the air
you breathe.  You must have them, or access to them in some way.  If you
cannot afford, or do not feel safe having books on the Craft, the internet
is
the next best place.</P>
<P>

In both books and on the internet you will find a wealth of knowledge that
will help guide you upon your new path.  Of course, as with anything else,
there is good information and bad information.  Avoid any kind of book, or
internet site, that speaks of controlling another person in any way, harming

them, doing love spells on a specific person, or tells you to chant in
latin,
even though you have no idea what you are saying (yes, I have seen sites
like
that).  These books/sites will not fulfill your need for knowledge in the
Craft and will only serve to confuse you.</P>
<P>
Once you have read a variety of books and feel called to this path, the next

step is to find a teacher. If you have access to a teacher, in my opinion
this is the best course of action.  A teacher or a coven can often be found
if there is a new age book store in your community. Also, the Witches Voice
is a site that offers networking in every state.  It has grown extremely
large over the past few years and is a valuable resource in the Craft
community.  All of my coven members have found me on the Witches Voice.</P>
<P>
Having a mentor can offer so much to you when you are beginning.  There will

be things you come across that you have a hard time understanding and need
clarification.  If you have a teacher, they are just a phone call or email
away.  If you do not, you must try to decifer things on your own, and may
not
come to the correct end on them.  If you do not have a teacher, again, the
internet is the next best place to look. </P>
<P>

If you are only looking for a 'how to' on casting spells, then the Craft is
not for you.  Witchcraft is a serious spiritual path, in which magick is
performed, but is secondary to the religion itself.  I would suggest you
look
to ceremonial magick for that.</P>
<P>

A couple of things need to be said about beginning this path, in light of
recent attitudes about the Craft.  Here lately it seems that you have a
people who, after reading a few books, feel as if they can call themselves
 a
master of the Art.  They throw on a title like Lady/Lord, or HP/s, add some
black clothes, a pentacle the size of a hubcap, and they are ready to go.
This is not what the Craft is about.  If you have spent years following a
particular path, have worked hard for the spiritual lessons that have been
presented to you, and through this have attained the title and rank, then by

all means use it.  But think of how you would feel if, after all that, you
have a newbie with 6 months and 5 books unde their belt walking about
calling
themselves Lady Starry Ski or Lord Thunderbutt.  It is very offensive.  Just

like your parents told you when you were growing up (or maybe you still are)

'don't rush things, it will all come to you in the end, and be sweeter for
the waiting'.  This is true with the Craft.  Using titles, putting on airs,
and in general acting high and mighty are not going to make you any more
spiritual.  And that is what this path is about.  What it will do is
alienate
you from people whom you may actually want to meet and get to know!
</P>
<P>
All of this being said the way to become a witch is through study and
dedication.  Gather all of the information you can.  Find the best teacher
possible.  Read whatever you can get your hands on.  Go outside in nature
and
commune with the Goddess and God.  Listen to the trees and the wind and the
rush of the water, for this is the witch's world.
