                          &quot;Dryghten&quot; Blessing Prayer (Gardnerian) 
          By: David Piper

          The only published copy of  the Blessing Prayer that  I know of is  in
          the  book &quot;Witch  Blood!   The Diary  Of A  Witch High  Priestess!&quot; by
          Patricia Crowther in  chapter four (paperback  edition 1974, House  Of
          Collectibles, Inc.).

                  &quot;In the name of Dryghtyn, the Ancient Providence,
                   Who was from the beginning and is for eternity,
                   Male and Female, the Original Source of all things;
                   all-knowing, all-pervading, all-powerful;
                   changeless, eternal.

                  &quot;In the name of the Lady of the Moon,
                   and the Lord of Death and Resurrection.

                  &quot;In the name of the Mighty Ones of the Four Quarters,
                   the Kings of the Elements.

                  &quot;Blessed be this place, and this time,
                   and they who are now with us.&quot;

          Life, Light, Love!
          Blessed Be!

          DP&gt;          When you  examine the &quot;Blessing  Prayer&quot; of English  Trad
          Wicca however, the  Dryghtyn is  obviously more than  just a  unifying
          essence  since It  is  called: &quot;the  original  source of  all  things;
          all-knowing,  all-pervading, all-powerful;  changeless, eternal.&quot;   It
          describes the Ultimate, the Absolute, the Godhead of which the God and
          the Goddess are at one and the same time, both Its Polarities and also
          Its first Manifestations.

          Dryghtyn is also the name used for JHVH in some old English bibles.  I
          think that was where the term actually originated.  I think I saw a
          passing reference to it  in some boxed comparative translated  text in
          &quot;In Search of the Indo-Europeans.&quot;
