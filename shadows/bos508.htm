              BURNING TIMES/CHANT       
                          -Charles Murphy
                                        
 In the cool of the evening, they used to gather, 'neath stars in
      the meadow, circled near an old oak tree.
 At the times appointed by the seasons of the Earth, and the phases
      of the moon.                      
 In the center of them stood a woman, equal with the others, and
      respected for her worth.          
 One of the many we call the Witches, the teachers and the keepers
      of the wisdom of the Earth        
 The people grew through the knowledge she gave them, herbs to heal
      their bodies, spells to make their spirits whole.
 Hear them chanting healing incantations, calling forth the Wise
      Ones, celebrating in dance and song
                                        
 Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna

 Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna
                                        
 There were those who came to power through domination, and they
      bonded in the worship of a dead man on a cross.
 They sought control of the common people by demanding allegiance
      to the church of Rome.            
 And the Pope declared the Inquisition, it was a war against the
      women whose power they feared.    
 In this Holocaust against the nature peoples, a million European
      women died.                       
                                        
 And the tales are told of those who, by the hundreds, holding
      together, chose their deaths in the sea.
 Chanting the praises of the Mother Goddess, a refusal of betrayal,
      women were dying to be free.      
                                        
 Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna

 Now the Earth is a witch, and the men still burn her! Stripping
      her down with mining and the poisons of their wars.
 While to us the Earth is a healer, a teacher, a mother.
 She's the weaver of the web of life that keeps us all alive.
                                        
 She gives us the vision to see through the chaos.
 She gives us the courage, it is our will to survive!
                                        
 Isis, Astarte, Diana, Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna....(repeat ad lib)
                                        
                        *               
                                        
                                        
                                        


                                                                            2293
