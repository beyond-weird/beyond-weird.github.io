                NOTTAMUN TOWN           
                     -Traditional       
                                        
    In Nottamun Town, in Nottamun Town  
    Not a soul would look up not a soul would look down
    Not a soul would look up, not a soul would look down
    To show me the way to fair Nottamun Town
                                        
    I bought me a horse t'was called a grey mare
    Grey mane and grey tail and green stripe on her back
    Grey mane and grey tail and green stripe on her back
    Weren't a hair upon her that was not coal black
                                        
    She stood so still threw me to the dirt
    She tore at my hide, she bruised my shirt
    From saddle to stirrup I mounted again
    and on my ten toes I rode over the plain
                                        
    When I got there no one did I see   
    they all stood around me just looking at me
    i called for a cup to drive gladness away
    And stifle the dust for it rained the whole day
                                        
    And the King and the Queen and the company more
    Came a riding behind and a walking before
    Come a stark naked drummer beating a drum
    With his hands in his bosom came marching along
                                        
    Sat down on a hard hot cold frozen stone
    Ten thousand stood round me but I was alone
    Took my heart in my hand to keep myself warm
    Ten thousand was drowned that never was born
                                        
                         *              


                                                                            2310
