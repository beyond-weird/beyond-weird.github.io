        SPRING STRATHSPEY                                             
             -Gwydion PenDerwyn         
                copyright probably to Nemeton
                                        
 Myrddyn was playing his pipes in the wood,
 And it sounded so good to my feeling.  
 Hiree, hiroo stirred the dance in the blood,
 And my fresh maidenhood started reeling.
                                        
    Sweetly it drew me, the song that went through me,
    As if sure it knew me, a maiden-song, laughing long.
    I'm sure that I hear it, Oh, let me draw near it,
    I want to be merrily courted in spring.
                                        
 Round us the trees formed a wheel in my mind,
 As if all womankind were careering.    
 Softly he touched me, our hands intertwined,
 And we gently reclined in the clearing.
                                        
    Sweetly it drew me, the song that went through me,
    As if sure it knew me, a maiden-song, laughing long.
    I'm sure that I hear it, Oh, let me draw near it,
    I want to be merrily courted in spring.
                                        
 Dew-fall to star-fall he made love to me,
 In a manner so free and revealing.     
 Swift-footed, light-footed, goat-footed, he
 Played a sweet melody with such feeling.
                                        
    Sweetly it drew me, the song that went through me,
    As if sure it knew me, a maiden-song, laughing long.
    I'm sure that I hear it, Oh, let me draw near it,
    I want to be merrily courted in spring.
                                        
 Daylight and I wake to spring's sweet bouquet
 And a glorious day of beginning.       
 Myrddyn has gone on his magical way,   
 But the equinox day leaves me spinning.
                                        
    Sweetly it drew me, the song that went through me,
    As if sure it knew me, a maiden-song, laughing long.
    I'm sure that I hear it, Oh, let me draw near it,
    I want to be merrily courted in spring.
                                        
                *                       
                                        
                                        


                                                                            2291
