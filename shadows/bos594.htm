                              Yule Ritual 
YULE DIVINE PLAY - by Lady Allusha, Coven Tara, publiched in the
Georgian Newsletter, December 1983

Characters:  Narrator, Earth Goddess, Handmaidens, Sun God
Props:  Yule Fire

Narrator:  It has been a long cold winter.  Here, where the trees are
all barren and the snow covers the ground the nights are dark and long.

Earth Goddess enters, followed by her Handmaidens.  They all move slowly
around towards the birthing spot.

Narrator:  We see shadowy figures in the distance, moving slowly.  The
delicate footprints lead into the deepest realms of the forest.  It is
the Earth Goddess, pregnant with Life, followed by her Handmaidens.

Earth Goddess stops.  Handmaidens gather before her and kneel.  Earth
Goddess starts to make soft birthing sounds.

Narrator:  Listen!  The Earth Goddess is about to give birth.   In the
midst of deepest darkness, light shall be reborn.  Lend her your aid!

Handmaidens start swaying gently, joining in the birthing sounds. 
Narrator encourages all present to join in the birthing sounds.  The
sounds get louder and louder until ...

Narrator:  The Sun is Born!

Sun God jumps out from hiding into the center.  He appears small and
weak.

Earth Goddess:  Go, my faithful Handmaidens, and build up the Yule fire.

That the weak Sun God shall grow in warmth and strength by its flames.

She collapses with a sigh.  Handmaidens build up the fire.  The Sun God
slowly grows as the fire grows, until he stands tall with his arms
outstretched.  He says, &quot; I have returned&quot;  Then he dances a little jig.
