                     CAMBRIAN DREAM     
                          -Gwydion PenDerwyn
                          copyright probably to Nemeton
                                        
  In the mountains of Cambria, by Rhymney's bright stream
  I have oft slept in heather, and dreamed a bright Dream
  No mortal could wake me, nor see what I've seen
  No landscape could ever compare.      
                                        
  'Twas the Land of my Fathers, unfettered, and free
  Ere the time that the Saxon swept over the Sea
  When mistletoe grew 'neath the shining Oak Tree
  No landscape could ever compare!      
                                        
  (Chorus): Dreaming of Prydein, asleep on a hill
            When I awaken, will you be there still?
            Oh, Island of Poets, my dreams you can fill
            But never the long waking hours.
                                        
  Mighty Poets and Warriors traversed every road
  Leaving stories and legends wherever they strode
  Their pasts are recalled in the humblest abode
  In tales of the sunnier days.         
                                        
  (Chorus)                              
                                        
  Now my story is ended, my song is all gone
  I have slept thru the evening, and into the dawn
  Yet still, I remember your Face, Albion,
  And your older, and much wiser ways!  
                                        
  (Chorus)                              
                                        
                          *             


                                                                            2311
