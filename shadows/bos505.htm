                -Gwen Zak               
              (Tune: &quot;Windmills&quot;)       
                                        
                                        
 In days gone by, when the world was much younger
 Men wondered at spring, born of winter's gold knife
 Wondered at the games of the moon and the sunlight,
 They saw there the Lady and Lord of all life.
                                        
 CHORUS:  And around and around and around turns the good earth   
          All things must change as the seasons go by,            
          We are the children of the Lord and the Lady,          
          Whose mysteries we know but we'll never know why.       
                                        
 In all lands the people were tied with the good earth
 Plowing and sowing as the seasons declared
 Waiting to reap of the rich golden harvest
 Knowing Her laugh in the joys that they shared.
                                        
 Through Flanders and Wales and the green land of Ireland
 In Kingdoms of England and Scotland and Spain
 Circles grew up all along the wild coastline
 And worked for the land with the sun and the rain.
                                        
 Circles for healing and working the weather
 Circles for knowing the moon and the sun
 Circles for thanking the Lord and the Lady
 Circles for dancing the dance never done
                                        
 And we who reach for the stars in the heavens
 Turning our eyes from the meadows and groves
 Still live in the love of the Lord and the Lady
 The greater the Circle the more the love grows
                                        
                        *               
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        


                                                                            2290
