            OOOOOOO                       &quot;There is no bond 

           O       O                       that can unite the divided 

           O       O                       but love: 

           O       O                       all else is a curse.&quot; 

            OOOOOOO    Z M A: 

                                                 -- AL I:41

                                          -- Gargantua, 57 

           

          &quot;For the cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave 

            his guard at the tree of life, and when he does, the whole of creat-

          ion   will be consumed, and  appear infinite. and holy  whereas it now

          appears  finite &amp; corrupt&quot; -- THE MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN &amp; HELL, 14 

           

           &quot;Every man and every woman is a star.&quot;--AL I:3 

           

                                   There is no god but humanity.

                  to play as they will: 

                  to rest as they will: 

                  to die when and how they will. 

           


                                                                            1415

                   when, where, and with whom ye will.&quot; -- AL I:51. 

           

           5. People have the right to use force to secure their rights. 

           

                  &quot;For how should I be able to govern others, 

                   when I don't know how to govern myself?&quot; -- Gargantua, 52
