                                           TO THE DRAGONS, REBORN 
              - 
                They say the flame wrought winds are dead; 
                 Ethereal dancing, jeweled wings - no more. 
                Monolithic rationality is the head. 
                 Noble dreams and works - shattered, torn. 
              - 
                Their world was theirs - never doubt. 
                 But the magic and power faded away, 
                When the light gave way to spiritual drought 
                 and Oppenheimer replaced Morganna Le Fay. 
              - 
                But in some strange souls they found a home: 
                 Those inspired, lost, exiled castaways. 
                Music and verse and The Craft are the bones 
                 Of these long lost archetypes of elder days. 
              - 
                And it takes a mere seed to create an oak, 
                 and music and light, rain and mirth, 
                bridging land and sky with it's growth; 
                 fulfilling the call to renew the Earth. 
              - 
                So nurture these dragons who live within you- 
                 The Burning has ended and they may go free. 
                Let them grow so that their work may continue. 
                 An it harm none, do what ye will - Blessed Be! 
              -
