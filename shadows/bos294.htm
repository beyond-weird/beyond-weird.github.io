                          Quarter Calls for The Dragon Tradition 


          EAST
          Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the East.  Your tongue is
          a sharp sword, cutting with the knowledge of the arcane.  Your spirit
          flows as graceful as a swift in flight.  Purify us with truth.
          Blessed Be.

          SOUTH
          Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the South, your breath is
          aflame with the  fires of  inspiration and  passion.   Your spirit  is
          searing and fervent.  Purify us with Love.  Blessed Be.

          WEST
          Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the West, your coils are the
          cleansing  healing waves that nurture  the soul.   Your spirit lunges,
          leaps  and splashes  like a Talbot  at play.   Purify  us with pulsing
          tides. Blessed Be.

          NORTH
          Mighty Dragon, Guardian of the realms of the North, your talons run
          like roots into the earth, giving you  infinite strength.  Your spirit
          is substantial,  hard and pure like  a clear crystal.   Purify us with
          persistant wisdom.  Blessed Be

          Each of  these Dragons has a  secret name that they  are also invoked-
          with.  A suggestion is that anyone using these invocations meditate to
          find an  appropriate name for each  Guardian and use it  along with or
          instead of the words &quot;Mighty Dragon&quot;.

          Blessed Be.

          Enjoy!
