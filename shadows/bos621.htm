                          Wicca vs. Paganism? 
                            By: David Piper

Firstly, Paganism is a collective term for many different faiths and
Wicca is one specific Pagan faith; however, specifics of Wicca IMHO:

Duotheistic monism *or* duotheistic monotheism (the One transcending
 the Two while the Two still have independent self-existence)

The Lady is the Mother of all Life and Giver of Rebirth: Her Womb is
 also the Tomb - &quot;that which enters the Cauldron living, dies
 but that which is placed in it dead, comes forth living&quot;

The Lord is the Father of all life, Son and Lover of the Goddess: He
 is born of Her, returns His Seed unto Her, returns to Her in
 death, and is reborn of Her

All initiated members are of the Priesthood: as Priest(ess) unto the
 self, if not to a group

The essential equality of all members, together with the respect for
 those of more experience and learning: Elders, HP, and HPS

Wiccans practice a somewhat &quot;formal&quot; liturgy - if only in terms of a
 regular &quot;opening&quot; and &quot;closing&quot; ritual, within which freedom
 and spontaneity can be expressed as the Spirit moves them

A common resemblance of working methods and practice, within a broad
 but nevertheless limited range of acceptable variation

The concept of &quot;Drawing Down&quot; - that the Deities can and do manifest
 Themselves &quot;unto visible appearance&quot; to Their worshippers

A reverence for sexuality as both natural and good, and as sacrament
 of the creative Union of the Lady and the Lord

The Great Rite - as the &quot;Sacred Marriage,&quot; in which Goddess and God,
 human and Divine, are brought to Unity, or Unity perceived

Respect for the &quot;Gifts of the Goddess&quot; (to borrow a Farrarian term),
 as the true means by which humans can come to directly know,
 and experience, the Divine - reason and logic fail; emotions
 and intuition and the &quot;psychic&quot; are the channels of contact,
 and experiential &quot;Knowledge&quot;

The concept of &quot;Naked in Her Sight&quot; as expressive of freedom, and of
 obedience to Her, and of equality with Brothers and Sisters;
 whether by literal, &quot;skyclad&quot; ritual nudity, or by symbolic,
 &quot;Naught is hidden from Your Sight&quot; ritual robes

Now, some of the ideas mentioned beg for more definition and further
discussion, but there's my offering for now...
