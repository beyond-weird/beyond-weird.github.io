<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> TOLEDO, Spain (Mar 13, 1996 1:21 p.m. EST) - Scientists 
  believe they could discover life outside the solar system within the next 25 
  years. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"Yes, definitely, there's life out there," Mike Kaplan, 
  director of U.S. space agency NASA's Origins program, told Reuters during a 
  meeting of astronomers in Toledo. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"I don't think we're alone." </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"We'll take some time to contact them, but one day 
  we will meet them and we will be surprised because they will be very different 
  from us," Kaplan said Tuesday. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"Within a maximum of 25 years, it will be possible 
  to discover life outside Earth," Kaplan said. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"Planet hunters" from across the world have gathered 
  in this historic Spanish city to discuss infrared interferometry, a technology 
  which will help the search for life outside the solar system. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"This is the first time that projects are being conceived 
  that will allow us to solve in around 20 years questions that humankind has 
  been asking for centuries," Kaplan said. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Last October Swiss astronomers detected a planet 
  outside the solar system for the first time. Shortly afterwards, American scientists 
  discovered two other planets. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Astronomers meeting in Toledo, excited by the discoveries, 
  say the question is no longer whether life can be discovered on other planets 
  but simply when it can be done. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"For the first time, it's not a dream, it's just 
  a question of time," said Kaplan, whose Origins program aims to study the origins 
  of the universe, the formation of planets and the existence of life outside 
  the solar system. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"Life on other planets, if not identical, will be 
  very similar to that on Earth," leading Spanish biologist Juan Oro told a news 
  conference. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Traditional telescopes, of which NASA's Hubble Space 
  Telescope is the most powerful, cannot contribute to the search because the 
  light from the stars drowns out that of the planets which orbit near them. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> The infrared interferometer, 40 times more powerful 
  than Hubble, would be capable of determining through infrared rays whether newly 
  discovered planets have the necessary conditions, like water and oxygen, to 
  shelter life. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Both NASA and the European Space Agency have separately 
  started to develop infrared technology. Both say international cooperation is 
  needed for such a project. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> ESA in February unveiled the first photographs taken 
  by its Infrared Space Observatory, which can see through dense dust clouds. 
  </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> NASA estimates the budget for building its interferometer 
  at $200 million a year for a period of 10 years. Europeans and Americans agree 
  the project inaugurates a new era for humankind. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"Discovering life out there would change everything: 
  philosophy, religion...and would make us feel humbler because we would find 
  out that we're not alone and we're not that special," Kaplan said. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"It's the beginning of a new era of explorations, 
  a new age of Galileo, and what's exciting about it is that it's within reach."
