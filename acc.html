    <font size="1" color="#FFFFFF"> Lecture given by Jack Shulman, President of 
    the American Computer Company, at the Global Sciences Congress. </font> 
  </CENTER>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Hi, I'm Jack Shulman. I'm the head of the American Computer 
  Company. American Computer Company is part of the Technology International Group 
  and Bell North America group of companies. I'm also one of the owners of the 
  group of companies. I've been in the computer industry for about 28 or 29 years. 
  I've worked for IBM as a professional services management consultant. I worked 
  on the development of the personal computer in 1978 for FIT (Fashion Institute 
  of Technology) and Simplicity Patterns, later adopted by IBM. I developed something 
  called the "pattern creator". That's where we got the term "PC". Prior to that, 
  I'd developed what you might call the first windowing operating system in 1975 
  for Citibank, and before that there were earlier versions I did for a company 
  called Vydec. I'm a serious computer person - very, very serious - and also 
  someone who's not generally inclined to leap to great predispositions about 
  any unusual subject. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Well, as it turns out, a few years ago I got my dose 
  of reality. It was in the form of a visit from a friend of mine. When I was 
  very young I'd got involved in technology, partly by virtue of the influence 
  of a friend's father. I grew up in central New Jersey, which is around where 
  AT&T and Bell Labs originated, and my friend's father was the head of Bell Labs. 
  I ended up at a private school and ended up living at the household of the head 
  of Bell Labs, going to that private school and going to college with his son 
  as a roommate, and I kind of grew up around the various projects at Bell Laboratories 
  in the late 1960s and early 1970s. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I'd always held out that AT&T was this rather magnificent 
  institution. Anybody here worked for AT&T in the past? So, you know when I say 
  Bell Labs research, I'm speaking Holy Grail; and in certain parts of the defence 
  community and in government I'm also speaking Holy Grail. Anyone here realise 
  that AT&T and Bell Laboratories ran our nuclear arsenal for 45 years? Anybody 
  who knows that, raise your hand. Not a one of you. I didn't really even know 
  until a little bit later in my career, but I knew something strange was going 
  on because it always seemed to me that AT&T always had what it needed to make 
  innovations in technology, and subsequently such technology would migrate to 
  an IBM or a Sarnoff Research or to an RCA. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> And I could never really figure out, in the course of 
  my young life, who were these magnificent, incredible scientists, other than 
  that I frequently met them...like a fellow by the name of William Shockley. 
  He was quite a frequent friend to Jack Morton's household, and I knew him, and 
  I knew some of the other folks that he knew, like a fellow by the name of - 
  well, I guess not too many people would know him - Bob Noyce, and Jack Kilby 
  who was an acquaintance of theirs, and so forth. These names, if you've ever 
  worked for AT&T or in the electronics industry, are also Holy Grail names. These 
  are Mount Rushmores of the technology industry. Jack Kilby is credited with 
  the invention of the integrated circuit. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I was rather shocked when, about late 1995, a dear friend 
  came to me. He was at one time one of the very well known generals in the Pentagon, 
  a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and is now a consultant. I'd known him 
  a very long time through the Morton family and Bell and when working for IBM. 
  He asked me to analyse some documents that he had in his possession. He showed 
  me some pictures. I kind of turned up my nose. I said, "I don't believe this." 
  He suggested they were pictures of an alien craft. I said to him, "Well, why 
  do you come to me and ask me this?" "Because there are some documents that fell 
  into my possession that I would also like you to see, that go beyond these drawings, 
  these pictures, these photographs, that describe some technology; and I would 
  like you to analyse this technology and make a determination for me of the veracity 
  of these documents, help me to authenticate them." I said, "Fine. I don't believe 
  this is real. I'm sceptical. I don't believe in aliens, I don't believe in UFOs, 
  I don't believe in any of that." And he said, "Okay, well, I'd still want you 
  to take a look at them, Jack." And I agreed. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I met with him at his home. I met a woman by the name 
  of Mrs Jeffrey Proscauer. That's not her real name, but it's the name she goes 
  by; she does not want her true identity revealed. And I got a chance to piece 
  and look through some 28 boxes of materials that had come from Western Electric 
  Laboratories in the late 1940s, 1947, early 1948 and beyond, and some subsequent 
  documents. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Now again, if you've ever worked for AT&T, you know 
  that the laboratories at Bell Laboratories are often quite distinct, and the 
  documentation from a laboratory is kept in an ongoing, growing tome called a 
  "Lab Shopkeeper's Notebook". It turns out that even in the super-secret laboratories, 
  the ones in the part of Western Electric or Bell Laboratories that manage the 
  nuclear arsenal, these notebooks are kept, and they grow and they're ongoing 
  and they become almost like a living representation of what that laboratory 
  did for a living. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Well, such as it is, I was rather shocked at what I 
  had to see there in these boxes of materials, and I convinced them to let me 
  look at them over the course of about three-and-a-half weeks. They were kept 
  at the consultant's house during that time period, and he actually kept a security 
  guard with them at all times because he was afraid that someone might come and 
  steal them. Now of course, I wasn't sure why he was afraid, because at the time 
  I didn't realise the full magnitude of what I was looking at. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In any event, after about two or three weeks of looking 
  at them, I came back to him and we sat down over what turned out to be a Christmas 
  Eve dinner, and I said to him: "I've got to tell you something. I'm having a 
  real problem with this because what you're showing me looks like technology 
  that we have not yet developed, that humanity has not yet developed, yet the 
  documents you're showing me appear to be forty-eight, forty-nine years old. 
  This would put them in 1947, 1948, 1949." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I suggested to him that before I could proceed I would 
  have to have someone verify the age, carbon-date or come up with some other 
  means to verify the age of the documents, and he agreed. So, with the help of 
  a mutual acquaintance - a private investigator formerly with the Justice Department 
  - we were able to take fragments of the documents without damaging them. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We sent them to an expert who formerly consulted for 
  Scotland Yard; he's a fairly well known forensic expert at...I believe it's 
  the University of Edinburgh in Scotland today; he was at a different university 
  at the time. He analysed these fragments of these documents for me, and came 
  back and told me that the ink, the paper, even the presentations were valid; 
  that this was in fact a book or series of books from the 1947, '48, '49, 1950 
  time period. That took him about four and a half weeks of analysis, and I was 
  for four and a half weeks, as you can imagine, holding my breath. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The things that I saw described in this Lab Shopkeeper's 
  Notebook consisted of things that today would be more powerful than the Intel 
  Pentium processor, for instance, or the Cray supercomputer. There were communications 
  devices that were described; there were ways to sandwich-in very, very thin, 
  micrometre-thin layers; special metals to produce moving parts for things like...from 
  the descriptions that I read, the nearest thing I could describe...an anti-gravity 
  propulsion unit for a spacecraft. They included dynamic electronic and power-control 
  technology that even to this day we have not yet developed. They included communications 
  technology that was described only as having been taken from an object of unknown 
  or unearthly origin. The documents were very carefully worded not to reveal 
  what was, in reality, in these boxes of materials. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I was sort of at a loss at that juncture, because even 
  though we had forensic information at the time from this particular forensic 
  expert that would date these boxes back to the late '40s, and even though they 
  said "Western Electric, Bell Laboratories", part of them said something called 
  "Z-Division" on them. We knew of the Z-Division: it was a segment of the United 
  States Army, formed in 1947 and 1948. The implications were that this project 
  was operating on the fringes of the nuclear bomb development project - then 
  known as the Manhattan Project Group. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> It turns out that in 1947 - between '47 and actually 
  late '48 - Harry Truman decided he was going to grant a contract to AT&T to 
  go through the overseeing and management of our nuclear arsenal and the commercialisation 
  of derived product technologies from the nuclear bomb, from the bomb project: 
  the physics, the electronics, the control systems, even the ballistics, the 
  radar that was used, the ICBM technology that was under development in the late 
  '40s after we got a hold of the V-series rockets from the Nazis, and so forth. 
  The contract was inked by Truman in early 1949, if I recall correctly, but during 
  the prior two-year period there was an informal relationship, during which AT&T 
  played a greater and greater role in the organisation of super-secret military 
  weapons-grade projects for the federal government and eventually got pretty 
  much control of what was then known as the Z-Division. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Z-Division, believe it or not, originated in Roswell, 
  New Mexico. I guess the reason is, that is where the original nuclear bomb armada 
  was formed - the first bomber wing that carried the nuclear bomb - and it migrated 
  over to Kirtland Air Force Base during the time period when Orlando Lawrence, 
  the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories fellow, was called in. He was called in by 
  Teller, Oppenheimer...all those folks responsible for the nuclear bomb...Leo 
  Szwilard. Lawrence was called in at the time because he could make accelerators, 
  or "cyclotrons" as they were known at the time. Those cyclotrons were capable 
  of refining uranium, refining plutonium...well, actually, back then, they weren't 
  working with plutonium but with uranium. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I guess you could imagine what it must have been like 
  in the time period. They were in the middle of a war when they were building 
  the nuclear bombs and they had to do everything secretly, so this Z-Division 
  was created with super-secrecy as its fundamental core. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Ultimately Lawrence was called in because they had to 
  build enough of an accelerator to refine enough uranium to make the bomb possible, 
  and, in spite of all the greatest minds of nuclear physics assigned to the Z-Division 
  in the Manhattan Project, none of them could figure out how to refine enough 
  uranium to make the nuclear bomb a possibility. This was before the first bomb 
  was exploded. So Lawrence was brought in because he knew how to make a cyclotron; 
  but his cyclotron, the biggest one he'd ever created, was about the size of 
  this white board over here, and it could produce about a thimbleful of refined 
  uranium - which would have been about enough to make a nuclear bomb capable 
  of blowing off your left foot. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In any event, Lawrence one day is called in and he's 
  asked: "How do we build a cyclotron big enough?" He makes a few calculations 
  and hands a requisition order to Harold Ackerman - today a federal judge, and 
  who was the chief supply clerk for the Manhattan Project - to requisition enough 
  silver to build a big silver racetrack; something like 12 million tons of silver. 
  In fact, he took it to the United States Treasury, handed it to the then Secretary 
  of the Treasury - I guess it was Morganthal - and Morganthal was asked to fill 
  a 12-million-ton order, which also necessitated the relocation of Z-Division 
  to some place where they could put all this silver and build this racetrack. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We decided one day at American Computer Company that 
  we were going to be brave. I talked with my board and I talked with some of 
  the people at the company and they agreed. "Yeah, we can try this; let's see 
  what happens." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We decided that we were going to take the story that 
  had been conveyed to me about this unusual Shopkeeper's Notebook with these 
  unusual technological artifacts in them, and naively and blithely put a panel 
  on the Internet, describing in black and white and colour what we had found, 
  and raise the question. However, the picture that we put up was a picture of 
  Testor's model of the so-called Roswell Lander. It's a picture of what looks 
  like a spacecraft with wings and a jet propulsion system, with a pod in the 
  front to hold alien occupants who were piloting it. We superimposed the picture 
  over an image from the Thunder Range - of course, we picked the wrong place; 
  the Plains of San Agustin was the right place, actually - and we put a little 
  bit of rhetoric on this panel and just placed it right in the middle of our 
  American Computer Company website. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Now that probably was the stupidest thing we ever did. 
  Here's this picture of a Roswell alien lander sitting on a panel in the middle 
  of a computer company website, and on it it said something like: "Did AT&T receive 
  stolen alien technologies from the US Government in 1947 and thereby invent 
  the transistor, the laser, the integrated circuit, and...on and on and on...different 
  technologies?" Well, we figured the reaction we would get from the public would 
  be one of, "Oh gee, isn't that cute? That's funny, X-Files, you know..." The 
  reaction we got was not one we had anticipated. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Three days after we placed the image onto our website, 
  we received a very strange series of military faxes to our tech support fax 
  machine, referring to a piece of hardware known as "Sky Station". Anybody ever 
  hear of anything called Sky Station? Never heard of it, have you? Well, it's 
  up there. It's an orbital platform of some kind. We were receiving live messages 
  from Sky Station for a day or two and we decided this wasn't right; we were 
  going to call the Pentagon and tell them about it. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> So I picked up the phone and first I called Fort Monmouth; 
  then I called down to Langley Air Force Base. They wanted to know, "Why are 
  you calling Langley Air Force Base?" Well, where else would I call about a satellite 
  that's sending messages to our fax machine...talk about sounding strange...that 
  say this satellite is about to crash, it's coming down, its communications systems 
  are breaking down. Well, finally we got to somebody who was of authority. It 
  was Colonel James that we got to, and he gets on the phone with me...I'm in 
  my car, on my car phone...and he says: "Mr Shulman, please secure these faxes. 
  Do not let anyone see them. We'll take care of it. We'll let you know what to 
  do with the faxes." It's like...the military goes silent. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> That next day our offices were broken into. Our front 
  door was smashed, our glass was smashed to smithereens all over the place, and 
  everything was taken out of the file cabinets in our offices. My office was 
  a wreck when I got in there. It was awful. We came in the next day to work and 
  it was like: what happened, what happened? </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I had these faxes in my briefcase. I'd taken them with 
  me, home. So apparently, by not leaving them there, I probably worsened the 
  situation. It might have been better if I'd left them there, to be frank; if 
  they'd found them and had just come and arrested us, taken us away. They were 
  top level, five-level clearance. We're not supposed to even see or even know 
  such a thing, but inadvertently, as a result, we became aware of the fact that 
  there's an orbital DSP [Defense Space Platform], called Sky Station, which is 
  nuclear-hardened and equipped to carry nuclear weapons, because it was described 
  in these faxes. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> It is not a very pleasant place to be, to discover that 
  now, here we are at the end of the Cold War with an agreement that there will 
  be no nuclear weapons in space in orbit, and there is apparently a platform 
  up there that the United States secretly put up back in the '60s or '70s or 
  '80s, that's equipped; it's nuclear-hardened, it's one of the Star Wars SDI 
  series, based on Spacelab, equipped to handle and carry nuclear weapons. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> So now, not only did we have a picture of an alleged 
  alien craft on our website, talking about alien technologies being transferred 
  to AT&T, but we also were in possession of very high level, Level Five, Top 
  Secret security clearance military faxes describing something called Sky Station. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> That week we had visits from the Air Force Office of 
  Special Investigations. They came up and they interviewed us. They put me through 
  a day-long third degree. We didn't want it happening in the middle of our customers 
  coming in and seeing us or selling personal computers and servers, so I took 
  them to an out-of-the-way part of the office, down the hall, down the elevator 
  to a little office downstairs, and I got a query about everything just short 
  of...well, it included my shoe size, when I was born, names of parents, names 
  of grandparents, when they entered the country, driver's licence number. They 
  went through a Q&A with me and with my staff, that just came short of asking 
  me the wrong question - if you know what I mean. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We were very startled, naturally. We weren't certain 
  what in fact was going on, but we're not ones to back down at American Computer 
  so we decided that instead of running for cover and taking the picture down 
  off of our website...because we kind of connected that the two things might 
  have something to do with each other...instead of backing down and turning it 
  all off, we would go the other direction. So we moved the picture to a separate 
  section of our website and created an entire website within our website, called 
  American Computer Company Special Investigation. This is what happens when you 
  grow up in New Jersey! Of course, we couldn't have rubbed salt into a deeper 
  wound: "Some have claimed that alien technology was found on board a UFO crashed 
  in Roswell, 1947. Very dramatic. Is it true? Did the US military discover something 
  strange in the desert near Albuquerque, New Mexico? Did they alter human history? 
  Was the transistor one of those alien marvels? Click here for the original story." 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We tried to be a little cute. We put up a picture, and 
  if you go to our website it's still there. If you go to our main website, https://accpc.com, 
  at the bottom of the page is a nav bar with a pointer in the middle of the corporate 
  info products, catalogue, features, tech support, Roswell 1947, help. You can 
  go to that link and click on it and it'll take you to this special page which, 
  of course, has now grown tremendously. It has something like, we estimate, about 
  9,000 messages and articles now stored within it. We started off on one Internet 
  server and moved it to five Internet servers, and now we are on one of our super-servers 
  which consists of four groups of four Pentium XEONs and three different service-provider 
  carriers and a whole lot of communications just to handle the load. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We get about, we estimate, three million to three and 
  a half million visitors a month to the site. And they're not necessarily people 
  like yourselves, open-minded, interested; they're kids from college, kids from 
  high schools, military people from countries like Iran...I'm serious! I mean, 
  we can track some of the addresses that show up in our logs. I didn't even know 
  Iran had Internet! We've got a very strange reaction to our story. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> What we did in the story was we isolated a few pointers, 
  some of which only I was privy to. One of them was that there was some relationship 
  between the government and AT&T that resulted in the transistor's invention. 
  I mentioned I grew up in the household of the head of Bell Labs, so I knew that 
  there was something strange about the transistor because I knew Bill Shockley, 
  and Bill Shockley was something of a witless buffoon. There's no way he could 
  have invented the transistor. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> The symbol for the transistor is made up of three pieces: 
  positive, positive and negative; or negative, negative and positive...silicon 
  dioxide doped with arsenic and boron, in 1947. Now, in 1947, doping things with 
  boron was not easy. It required the sort of equipment that even Bell Labs in 
  1946 did not possess. They had this type of equipment at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories 
  - but it would have taken thousands and thousands and thousands of man-hours 
  to invent the transistor. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> If you look back at it historically, what AT&T was claiming 
  was that one day this "genius", William Shockley, was working with a rectifier; 
  he looked at it and he noticed it had unusual propensities, and there, bingo, 
  he invented the transistor! He figured it out right there! And to verify that, 
  the two other "geniuses" that they got to help work on the transistor, Dr Bardeen 
  and Dr Brattain, both said: "Oh yeah, I remember a guy by the name of Case was 
  (allegedly) talking about transistors in 1931, and I knew back then we were 
  going to have them." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> That is the history of the transistor at AT&T prior 
  to 1948, other than claiming it was invented in December of 1947 by Dr Shockley. 
  Anybody believe that story? Me neither. And I knew, because the administrative 
  head of the transistor project was Jack Morton - the man at whose house I was 
  staying to go to school and whose sons I was friends with - and he often commented 
  on the fact that it was really a shame that those three idiots got responsibility 
  for the transistor and he didn't. And I always wondered, because he too didn't 
  possess the scientific ability to develop the transistor. He was a brilliant 
  man who had invented the radiobroadcast vacuum tube, the close-spaced triode, 
  but it appears as if he was brought in to head up the project to try to draw 
  back the transistor in time to radio tubes and the things that Shockley talked 
  about; and it was as if the whole thing was just a ploy and he might as easily 
  have been given responsibility and got the Nobel Prize as Bill Shockley. Professional 
  jealousy? </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In any event, for most of my young life I believed that 
  the transistor had come from a government project and that they were just hiding 
  its origins. Which government project, I did not realise until I saw the Shopkeeper's 
  Notebook in the possession of my friend, the consultant. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Now, I'd heard a lot about Roswell in my life and I'd 
  read the <A HREF="bluebook.html">Project Blue Book</A> books and I'd read a 
  lot of books like Berlitz's books and so forth, but I was not someone who believed 
  in Roswell, who believed that a UFO had crashed at Roswell at the time, in any 
  event. There I was, stuck with all this information and having created this 
  rather minor scandal on the Internet...well, maybe not minor, with the Air Force 
  coming to visit us. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Next thing I know, radio talk show host Art Bell sends 
  science reporter Linda Moulton Howe to my office. She has to be there because 
  she has to see whether or not our offices were actually broken into. A beautiful 
  woman, very intelligent...she shows up at the office with a tape recorder. I'm 
  exhausted...the weeks have been going not so good lately, and we're still picking 
  up the pieces of glass out of the sofas in the lobby. She sees the windows are 
  broken in the front and we have a wooden partition set up to try to keep the 
  air out of the building, and she records me answering questions about all this. 
  I try to be as vague as I can and answer the questions about what's going on 
  here, and she talks about the story. And next thing I know, she plays the tape 
  on "Dreamland", on Art's show. I swear to God, it was the strangest thing we 
  had ever seen happen! </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> That very next day we got well over 3,000 phone calls 
  from people all trying to get in to see me personally; they had to come to see 
  me personally, to tell me about Roswell. We received mail and e-mail by the 
  10,000 pieces. Our normal 2,000 visitors a day on our World Wide Web site jumped 
  up so high that one of our carriers refused to carry us anymore. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> At that point I realised there's more than just a casual 
  interest on the part of the public, so we decided we would carry the original 
  ACC Roswell story right through to its ultimate conclusion. We have been for 
  several years now. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> So, we have publicised the fact that Dr Morton met his 
  untimely death and that Dr Morton was one of the few people who knew the true 
  history of the transistor at AT&T - aside from Bill Shockley who would never 
  have talked because that would have meant the end of his Nobel Prize, along 
  with Drs Bardeen and Brattain, and Dr Kilby who subsequently went on to bigger 
  and better things, and he's dead now. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> It looked like Dr Morton was breaking camp with AT&T 
  and was very, very outspoken, very angry with AT&amp;T over this whole thing. 
  Professional jealousy, I guess. One day in 1972, Dr Morton was found knocked 
  unconscious and set afire in his Volvo P18 sports coupé, devastating the Morton 
  household and family - my friends - and for reasons that nobody seemed to know. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Well, we decided to see whether or not there might be 
  any link, any reason to link Dr Morton's possible migration to a Japanese firm, 
  and we tried to make an inquiry about it with the corporate security department 
  at AT&T. That's when we discovered that there are people working in corporate 
  security at AT&T who don't want to talk about Dr Morton's untimely death. Now, 
  you've got to understand, we're talking about something which happened 25 years 
  ago. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> So we were investigating further, and I interviewed 
  a member of the Morton household who was talking about the transistor project 
  and got very, very teary-eyed when I talked about the transistor. I said, "Oh, 
  did you ever wonder where the transistor really came from?" It was as if I had 
  cut a jugular. The conversation ended right there. "Can't discuss this further 
  with you." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We looked into it a little bit further and it became 
  clear to us that Dr Morton was probably responsible for this Shopkeeper's Notebook 
  working its way outside of AT&T - probably, because he was the principal investigator. 
  Everybody knows what a principal investigator is. Involved in any government 
  project you have a principal investigator. They have to name somebody to take 
  the blame. When AT&T screws up, they have to have someone to fire, and they're 
  certainly not going to pick someone important enough in their view; they're 
  going to pick the one that everybody doesn't like. He was a tough guy; very, 
  very strong-minded; and everybody didn't like him that much, so they made him 
  the principal investigator. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> There were other people involved, apparently. There 
  was a fellow by the name of Ramey. He was a figure at the Department of the 
  Army. He was named in the documents. There were quite a few other people named 
  in the documents. We're not revealing all of the people at this particular juncture 
  because of Mrs Proscauer who won't allow us to give out certain things. And 
  in order to continue on an ongoing basis having access to these documents and 
  so-called Notebook, we're very cautious about the information we give out. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In any event, we decided to depict in a series of pages 
  on the Internet the entirety of the story of what we'd been going through, going 
  on the theory that one of the ways you can protect yourself from, for instance, 
  being assassinated by having information in your possession that's dangerous 
  to others, is to publicise it as widely as you possibly can - which is what 
  we did. Of course, there's a certain drawback to that approach. The drawback 
  was that within no time the attacks, the onslaughts, the assaults, the death 
  threats, the credibility attacks, the undermining of credibility, the public 
  humiliation, pain and suffering began. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We found ourselves besieged by what I can only describe 
  as a multilateral black project, which included death threats on myself and 
  my family, death threats on our employees, pictures of me with bullet holes 
  and blood dripping out, on the Internet, out of the blue...a really, really 
  strange thing to have happen. We had people come up and claim they had been 
  hired by us to verify the claims that technology like this originated on an 
  alien spacecraft. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> And you've got to understand, we didn't say that it 
  originated on an alien spacecraft. We asked the question, "Did it originate...?" 
  Would you run around on the Internet saying this technology came from an alien 
  spacecraft? No. You'd ask the question. You'd say, "Let's put together the evidence; 
  let's find out." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We decided we would approach a higher authority, ask 
  the question to the higher authority and make it a matter of public record. 
  So, who is a higher authority, other than, say, Bill Clinton, that you might 
  go to to ask the question: Did the transistor and subsequent technologies fall 
  into the hands of AT&T from the Nazi Germans, the Japanese? Well, neither of 
  them had any of this stuff. Secret government project? Well, the United States 
  Government couldn't build any of this stuff. Half this stuff that we saw in 
  the Notebook...even today we don't even have some of the minerals, some of the 
  chemical materials, necessary to create them. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We decided we would ask the Secretary of Defense, William 
  Cohen. In fact, we got William Cohen and then his administrative assistant on 
  the phone, and the head of the Air Force OSI instantly on the phone with us, 
  and sent them a kit and kaboodle of stuff to take a look at. We asked them to 
  come down, take a look at things that we wanted explained in their original 
  context. Well, we've never heard from them about it. We haven't heard from the 
  Air Force or OSI - we filed OSI 9001 pages, demands, with them. We've never 
  heard a single word back from the OSI, the Air Force, the Pentagon. They've 
  kept their distance, accepted the requested requests and violated the law, because 
  under the law, when you give them these demands, they have 30 days to respond. 
  Not a single response. As if to say, "You're not influential enough to get us 
  to respond to these." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In any event, we got nowhere with them so we decided 
  we might embarrass them a little bit. Now, how do you embarrass the Air Force? 
  I mean, sometimes they do a pretty good job of embarrassing themselves! But 
  how do you embarrass the Air Force, how do you embarrass William Cohen, the 
  Secretary of Defense, particularly in a time period when we're in the middle 
  of an ersatz situation of war with Iraq, when the Cold War is over? You publish 
  your findings; you have to have findings. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> I was invited to appear a total of 15 times on radio 
  shows, including Art Bell again, Sightings, the Mike Jarmus Show, ABC News, 
  and finally I turned down the Larry King Live show. I'd just about had enough. 
  I was on ABC News, though, about three weeks ago. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We built two of the devices we saw in the Lab Shopkeeper's 
  Notebook. One of them was a semiconductor device. This semiconductor device 
  we called the "Transfer Capacitor", and it has actually shocked the industry. 
  People called me "lunatic" and "liar" and every conceivable name in the book 
  for a period of 11 months as we described the transfer capacitor's unusual capability. 
  It can be made about the size of a molecule, it can be controlled by microvolts 
  of electricity, it produces no heat and it switches at 12 terahertz. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Does anyone know what a terahertz is? Intel Pentium's 
  transistors switch at 500 megahertz or some small multiple thereabouts. This 
  thing is 12,000 times faster than the fastest transistors we've ever built. 
  We tested it. We actually went out and got some silver alkane from a company 
  in Pennsylvania that makes semiconductor materials. We built one, we tested 
  it. We then realised that we could build it very dense. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We got some friends who operated a company called InMos, 
  who had some semiconductor materials, and over six months - this is two years 
  ago - we built an 8-gigabyte solid-state hard drive in a space about 'yay' big...poker-chip-sized...operating 
  at the same speed, 12 terahertz, capable of replacing the memory of a PC. We 
  subsequently built 2,500 of them and sent them out in the form of test kits 
  for people in industry to evaluate - people who refused to believe that such 
  a thing could exist. We sent them to Rohm & Haas; we sent them to Intel. We 
  got some of them back. People didn't even want to look at them: "What is this 
  nonsense?" Motorola wouldn't take one, interestingly. Texas Instruments took 
  one. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In any event, for six months I had to put up with some 
  of the most obnoxious, insulting, nasty comments you could imagine, even when 
  I was at meetings of my own professional conferences. "The crazy alien guy with 
  his flying-saucer transistor" - that was typical. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Ultimately what bailed us out was that a friend of mine 
  who used to work for IBM, now for Lucent, managed to convince his private funding 
  agency to give Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories a grant to check us out at ACC. 
  He picked Lawrence Berkeley because they probably have the highest integrity 
  of all the physics laboratories in the world - the ones who had the 10,000-foot 
  racetrack, made out of 12 million tons of silver, that in 1947 must have knocked 
  Henry Morganthal right out of his leather chair when it was requested. They 
  tested using the same procedures, but they had a much better laser than we did. 
  We only had a little laser at Princeton. They had a big laser with which they 
  could watch the movement of electrons, and they verified not only the function 
  but the speed. So, Lucent managed to double-check our work, even though it won't 
  officially admit it. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> What the "T-cap" or Transfer Capacitor really is, is 
  a metal-insulated dielectric junction semiconductor based on silver alkane. 
  It works on the principle whereby electrons strike the bond in question, elevate 
  its energy level and, boom, what was an insulator becomes a conductor in a half 
  of a millionth of a billionth of a second! Very fast! It persists for about 
  two thousandths of those millionths of a billionths of a second and turns itself 
  off. We use two of them in a pair, one to refresh the other, and they nearly 
  never lose any electrons. Once we charge them up, they stay charged for an hour. 
  So we only need a tiny bit of power to power them. They produce no heat. We 
  can't measure heat from these things because the heat, if it were there, is 
  absorbed back into the substance, the silver alkane, because of its unusual 
  propensities. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Now, everyone who has ever owned a PC knows how much 
  heat today's computer microprocessors generate. It's unearthly! And the faster 
  they get, the more heat they generate. The power they consume is being turned 
  into heat, like a toaster oven. That's why people call PCs "video toasters". 
  This thing, if it were used to replace the transistors, the 130 million or so 
  throughout your PC, would produce no heat. Instead of consuming 150 watts, it 
  would probably consume one-thousandth of a watt. And it's been sitting on the 
  shelves for nearly 50 years! </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In any event, we've got this story, and 9,000 messages 
  and news items about it. Really strange things and people that come on: a fellow 
  by the name of Wang on the private alleged web identities of two very public 
  figures; fraudulent publications about ACC; hackers who hack into our website. 
  </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> If you go to our website and read through it, you'll 
  be truly amazed. You'll be stunned, you'll be shocked. You will also walk away 
  no longer a sceptic, if you were. If you're someone who believed, you will now 
  see what I call "third party circumstantial evidence" that verifies that something 
  very unusual happened in New Mexico in 1947. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We recently received, courtesy of the Russian Federation, 
  a transcript of a statement on the subject by Leonid Alexiev. Leonid Alexiev, 
  a Russian General, chaired a blue-ribbon committee to look into this in 1997, 
  when it was brought to their attention when Bill Clinton went to Russia and 
  some students stood up and said, "We saw this website called American Computer, 
  and there it was said that the Defense Department has a UFO in the United States. 
  Is this true, Mr Clinton?" Bill got up and said, "I don't know. No, no, it's 
  not true. But wait a minute. I tried to ask the Defense Department, but they 
  wouldn't tell me." </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In any event, the Russians decided to put together this 
  committee, and I don't know if they spent the millions of dollars on our account; 
  they might have. They sent us a copy of the transcript of the report by Alexiev, 
  which was also carried on The Learning Channel, TLC, last week. The Russians 
  have decided there's an alien presence in our solar system, based on all the 
  evidence, on these things they've examined. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> They've somehow got a hold of pictures of our transcapacitor 
  from our lab. I don't know how, because we've never taken any. Leave it to the 
  Russians! The KGB doesn't exist anymore; it's called the MSB now, right? And 
  Alexiev has gone public, as have the Russians, and as a result of his report 
  he has now been appointed by...what's the name of the head of the Russian Republic, 
  the drunken guy? Yeltsin...Boris has appointed him head of the Russian Space 
  Command. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> As an aside, we thought we would solicit a few senators' 
  opinions. We solicited the offices of Senator Kennedy - another man who likes 
  the glass of wine occasionally. In any event, we got a very strange reaction 
  from the office of Senator Kennedy. They sent us a folio about a study that 
  was done on funding, that was publicised by the Senator's office. In the middle 
  of it they had yellowed out a section that talked about the deep space probe 
  series that NASA is sending out - the Deep Space 1. I think they're naming them 
  after that Star Trek show, Deep Space 9. When they get to nine, I don't know 
  what they'll do! </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> In any event, Deep Space 3 or Deep Space 4 is slated 
  to receive a piece of equipment called a "laser cannon". At Lincoln Labs there's 
  a funded project afoot to develop, on a rush basis, an offensive weapon based 
  on laser technology, because wherever this deep-space probe is going, they believe 
  they need it. Deep space is the space outside of the solar system, or at the 
  extreme ends of the solar system. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> Apparently Senator Kennedy was one of the sponsors, 
  but the senators and congressmen do not hold the same opinion as the Defense 
  Department and the Air Force about whether there's an alien presence in or right 
  outside of our solar system. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> So, right now, that's about where we're up to. We're 
  starting to commercialise the transfer capacitor and look at partners; we're 
  going to get it out there. We figured, why not? We've spent so much money on 
  the research investigation, we might as well see if we can sell these things 
  to people. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> British Telecom has jumped in and stated they've placed 
  a letter-of-intent order with us. They're using it in a product they call the 
  "Soul Catcher" chip. We've had some preliminary discussions with a company called 
  Shipley, the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductor materials. </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We've had discussions with Intel, IBM. Just in the last 
  few months, a guy from IBM said, "You should have been dealing with us all along." 
  "Well, why didn't you come to us?" "Well, I'm coming to you now." "There are 
  a lot of people who are interested." "Well, we're IBM." "So? You had these in 
  your lab all along and couldn't get them to work!" </font>
<P><font color="#FFFFFF"> We're not sure what direction it's all going to go in, 
  but I just wanted to end with this. This morning, as I was going up in the elevator, 
  I felt like I was hanging upside down, holding the world up with my feet. The 
  next time you get in the elevator out there, think about that. That's how we 
  feel at ACC. </font>
