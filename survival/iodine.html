How to use iodine to sterilize water

 How to use iodine to sterilize water.  Put 4-8 grams of iodine crystals in a
1 oz. glass jar (must have glass or bakelite stopper otherwise the iodine will
react with the plastic or metal stopper and destroy it.)  Actually 0.1 gram is
adequate for the job, but using a larger amount of iodine creates a saturated
solution much quicker.
  Put in 1 oz. (1 tablespoon or 3 teaspoons) of water (at least room
temperature, body temperature prefered).
  Close  stopper and shake for several minutes.  You now have a saturated
solution.  A saturated solution is when as much solid has disolved in a liquid
as it can.
  Carefully pour off 10ml (10cc, 2 teaspoons) of the saturated solution.
REMEMBER, the iodine crystals are VERY TOXIC!  The reason that adding more
water than needed is suggested is so that you need not tip the bottle over too
far thus spilling some crytals.
  Add the 10ml (2 teaspoons) of saturated solution to 1 liter (1.06 quart) of 
water.
  Let  stand  at  least 15 minutes at 77 degrees F. or higher. Make sure all
of the interior surface including lid get treated.
    
  How to use ionic iodine to counter radioactive iodine contamination.
  KI (potassium Iodide) (reagent grade is best)
  one  pound of KI = 3,500 doses = treatment for 35 adults or children for 100
days.
  Purchase crystalline or granular KI (reagent grade).
  Fill a glass jar 60% full of KI (2 oz. of KI in a 2 0z. bottle *dark glass*)
  Fill with water (90%)
  Shake for two minutes.
  Some of the KI should remain undissoloved (proof of saturated solution!)
  1 drop of saturated solution = 28 to 36 mg. of KI
  130  mg KI per day (4 drops) for Adults (FDA recommended daily dose), 65 mg 
per day (2 drops) for infants under 1 year.
  Radioactive iodine has a 8 day halflife, so 80 days = .1% (1/1,000)
  Period of dosage, start dosage beginning of first warning of a radioactive
iodine release from nuclear reactor accident or nuclear bomb detonation, 
continue until at least 10 days beyond most recent release of radioactive 
Iodine 131 is recommended minimum, 100 days would be the most conservative 
method of treatment.  Having only doses for a day or two is VASTLY better than
none at all.  See Kearney -NUCLEAR WAR SURVIVAL SKILLS 1987 PAGES 111-115.
