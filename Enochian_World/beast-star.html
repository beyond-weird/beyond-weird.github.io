<H2>The Beast and the Star:<br>
A Vision of the Abyss</H2>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>The manuscript that follows is an account of a vision 
relating to the nature of the Ruach, the crossing of the Abyss, and of what is 
found beyond. In order to achieve a full understanding of what is given here, it 
is helpful to be familiar with Liber Al vel Legis, also known as The Book of the 
Law.</p>

<p>In addition, the system of correspondences on which the 
vision is based is not the traditional method, as used by the Golden Dawn and 
its successors. Instead, reference should be made to the system presented by 
Frater Achad (Charles Stansfield Jones). Achad's system varies from the G.D. 
system in that the paths are assigned to radically different positions on the 
Tree of Life. A diagram of Achad's version of the Tree is in the frontpiece of 
his book The Anatomy of the Body of Sad- Reference to this diagram will help to 
understand certain portions of the vision.</p>

<p>While the vision includes a description. from one viewpoint. 
of the crossing of the Abyss, it should not be inferred that I am claiming to 
have achieved any particular Grade of initiation by virtue of having had this 
vision. Readers are welcome to draw their own conclusions as to my level of 
achievement, but such conclusions will be neither confirmed or denied.</p>

<p>Since I have only a meager knowledge of the various systems 
of star-worship in existence today, I would welcome comments from persons having 
a knowledge of such systems. Comment from persons with other viewpoints is also 
welcome. All serious correspondence will receive an answer. Frivolous or 
insulting letters will be answered or not, according to the mood of the moment.</p>

<p>Correspondence should be addressed to:</p>

<p>On the night 4/3/84 between the hours of 9:30pm and 12:00 
midnight, I experienced a series of visions that seem of particular importance 
in relation to my work with Liber Legis and the Cabala.</p>

<p>At the time these visions began, I was meditating on the 
sexual process in human beings, specifically on the subjective aspects of the 
act as it is experienced by the two sexes. It suddenly came to me that there is 
a progressive development in man from being the pentagram to being the hexagram.</p>

<p>Natural man is viewed as the pentagram of the elements, as a 
being with five limbs, and five basic forces composing his being. These are the 
traditional elements of fire, air, water; earth, and spirit. The spirit aspect 
can either be directed towards the sexual forces (symbolized by the inverse 
pentagram) or it can be directed towards the spiritual realms.</p>

<p>It was shown to me that Man can become developed to the 
degree that the spirit (defined as the consciousness aspect) can be directed to 
either the sexual or the spiritual side at will. or to both at the same time. 
When a man attains this degree of development, he becomes the hexagram. The 
sexual organs. male or female. become the sixth paint which is missing in the 
pentagram.</p>

<p>There were then a series of pictures in which the relations 
between the downward-pointing triangle and the upwardpointing triangle in the 
hexagram were demonstrated. It was noted that the forces of the two triangles 
are complimentary and act in opposition to each other when allowed to. They tend 
to push each other apart, causing Dispersion. It was then shown that for the 
triangle to unite into the hexagram in man. they have to be interlocked with 
each other. Otherwise, the downward-tending emotional forces (Luna, Mars, 
Jupiter) and the upward-tending mental forces (Saturn, Mercury, Venus) will act 
in such a way as to disrupt each other's effects.</p>

<p>There was another series of pictures next which rapidly went 
through all the possible combinations of forces that can be derived from the 
hexagram.</p>

<p>Now, it was pointed out to me that each of these forces in 
turn. as well as all other existing forces. are in their essential nature 
completely mysterious. No matter how many times we invoke, no matter how much we 
study the results of our invocations, we can never reach to understanding of 
what these forces are in themselves. All that we can come to understand is the 
manner in which they act upon our consciousness.</p>

<p>The vision expanded upon this theme by taking each of my own 
areas of particular study, and demonstrating that I was no closer to 
understanding their essence than when I started twelve years ago. It had come to 
the point where I had masses of information about the effects of each force, and 
neat formulas +or the action of many of them, but no real clue to their 
essential nature.</p>

<p>At this revelation. I experienced a sense of total failure of 
my efforts. All of the work I had done was revealed as being without any lasting 
purpose. All things that exist were seen as being unsolvable in themselves. and 
without reason.</p>

<p>My thoughts were shattered at this. My mind made many 
attempts to make this failure comprehensible, but each reason that came to mind 
was immediately shown to be simply more of the same, the same circular reasoning 
of the Ruach, which never ends because it folds back an itself and reappears in 
a new form. Each thought was shattered in the moment of its formation.</p>

<p>Finally, I was unable to generate any more thoughts, and I 
saw before me the Abyss, which is the perception of the total lack of any 
foundation for the activities of the Mind. All that I had felt to be myself was 
shown to be the Mind, ever re-entrant, never progressing beyond its own nature.</p>

<p>I was shown that I had a choice: I could retain my hold upon 
the Ruach, continue to identify my Self with it, or I could jump out of it, be 
as free of it as I have said I wanted to be, by leaping into the abyss with no 
knowledge of what would confront me on the other side. Indeed, there was no 
guarantee that I would reach the other side.</p>

<p>Holding onto the Ruach was futile, as had already been shown. 
There was no escape from it except to let go and leap. Thinking. &quot;There must be 
SOMETHING on the other side&quot;, I threw myself forward into the abyss.</p>
<p>The crossing seems simple in retrospect, though in that first 
leap it seemed a jump into nowhere. As one jumps, all that one has perceived 
himself to be is stripped from him, leaving nothing but a bare and defenseless 
awareness, void of Self. </p>

<p>There is a period where one is not anchored to one's 
jumping-off point, and where the far side is not in sight. One exists in an area 
where there is seemingly nothing. There is an opportunity to hesitate in the 
middle of the jump, but if you hesitate, you are lost. No matter how 
energetically you take off, you always end up having used just enough energy to 
get to the other side. Hesitation destroys your momentum, leaving you to +all 
into the endless deep, having nothing but yourself.</p>

<p>In an alternative view, this hesitation is actually an 
attempt by the awareness to grab onto what it had just lost, to join itself 
again with the personal ego that it has just given up. This clinging is the 
danger that creates the Black Brotherhood. They have fallen into the Abyss, and, 
having not come to the other side they believe that there is no other side, that 
there is nothing beyond themselves. They lose the ability to perceive the 
meaning of events, as does everyone who crosses. Not having reached the other 
side, they never attain the replacement for this sense, which is the ability to 
perceive purpose or intent.</p>

<p>Arriving at the other side resulted in a simultaneous 
experience of several different revelations. I will try to put them into some 
kind of consecutive order, but in practice there was no way to separate the 
times of their occurrence.</p>

<p>Looking back from over the Abyss, you have the first chance 
ever to see the Ruach as a whole, to see from the outside the personality you 
have built through magickal efforts. This body of yours, made up of the Ruach. 
contains every experience you have had since your first moment of consciousness 
up to the time of your leap.</p>
<p>Seeing my own personal self from this perspective, I thought 
of what purpose it might have served. It appeared to be ugly, darkly streaked 
with the results of pains given and received, failed thoughts and actions, 
distorted concepts. What could be the purpose of this mess?</p>

<p>It was revealed to me why this Ruach, the entire conscious 
self of the incarnate life. was the true Beast, called 666. It is wild, 
uncontrollable from within, absorbing every fleck and mote of consciousness into 
its own schemes. This tendency to devour everything in sight is the reason for 
its being called the Beast. </p>

<p>Then, while still perceiving the ugliness of the Beast, 
another image formed in tandem with it. There appeared before my eyes a vision 
of a beautiful star. Not a star as seen in our universe, but a crystalline star, 
brilliantly faceted. Every ray of the star was a line of light. Every flare and 
prominence was an incredible geometric form, changing constantly in detail, each 
change making it more brilliant than the last. Unlike our mundane stars, this 
star lives in a universe of brilliance, lighting up the farthest reaches with 
the light of its own existence. The star seemed to me to be so beautiful that I 
thought it must be the very antithesis of the Beast.</p>

<p>But behold, I was cautioned to observe the events before me 
with care. I looked closer and realized then that for every streak of pain, joy, 
despair, hate, love, or whatever that occurred in the body of the Beast, there 
was a corresponding flash of brilliance, or a new growth of prominences, in the 
body of the Star. They were, in fact, one and the same thing! I was reminded of 
the myriad unsolvable mysteries I had earlier perceived. Each appearance of a 
new mystery, a new object, feeling, thought, or force in the material world was 
transformed into the shining rays of the Star, and each pain was a flash of 
beauty.</p>

<p>This is the meaning of the important phrase in book I of 
Liber AI vel Legis: &quot;Every man and every woman is a star&quot;. Each being alive in 
the world is simultaneously incarnated as a star in this other universe. Rather, 
that star is our incarnation, viewed from the correct point of vantage. The 
purpose of each of us is to increase the beauty and the brilliance of the Stars 
that we are, by our experience of the ugliness, beauty, and mundanity of this 
world of Earth.</p>

<p>Somewhere among all this, it was told to me that the Beast is 
not named that only for its omnivorousness with respect to experience, but 
because &quot;once you have tamed the Beast, he becomes a great workhorse for your 
purposes, and the rest becomes easy&quot;. I took this to mean that from the north 
edge W the Abyss onwards, the path became more accelerated. This was confirmed 
later in the vision. (Another reason for calling it the Beast -seen from the 
outside, it definitely has that quality of dangerous and regal playfulness one 
normally associates with lions.)</p>

<p>The vision opened up so that a larger area could be seen, and 
there appeared a whole universe of such stars as we have been speaking of. I saw 
that any thing in our universe could produce a star of greater or lesser scale, 
depending on its degree of evolution and the degree of inclusiveness of its 
consciousness. The stars that are humans were all of the same scale. When I 
looked closer, I saw that each human star enfolded within itself the stars 
created by a myriad other sorts of being, from the atoms that make up our 
bodies, through the independent biomes of the bacteria and germs that inhabit 
us, to the larger stars of the organs of our bodies. Similar stars of a finer 
quality within the human star were produced by the forms we generate on the 
astral and mental levels.</p>

<p>The human stars were enclosed within two greater stars, one 
that of the Earth-spirit, and one that of the Sun. The planets and other 
physical stars could be seen to exert their influence from outside the star of 
the earth-spirit.</p>

<p>In all these stars, at all the levels, many different 
mathematical, geometric, visual, and astrological symbolic relationships are 
expressed. The expressions were manifest in the relations of the various rays of 
each star to its other rays. Any particular ray could be part of many 
expressions. The star as a whole encompassed and went beyond all of the 
expressions it contained in its completion.</p>

<p>Depending on the viewpoint one chose to take, any of the 
symbol systems used by humans could be used to describe the relationships 
existing within the star. The astrological or the alchemical, the religious or 
the humanist, nontheist, theist, and polytheistic systems are all equally 
applicable, and all fail to reach a true description of the whole star's being. 
&quot;Every number is infinite: there is no difference. &quot;</p>

<p>The space in which these stars live has a unique quality of 
its own. In it, all dimensions are absolutely flat. That is, the space does not 
exhibit that quality of being distorted around a large mass, as our own 
relativistic space does. It appeared more like the Newtonian or Aristotelian 
&quot;absolute space&quot;, which extends forever in all directions without curving around 
to meet itself. I could feel myself to be in a space that was not stressed or 
distorted in any way. By comparison with this star-universe, our own space seems 
to have the consistency of curdled milk, full of globs and thin spots.</p>

<p>Then it was shown to me that the patterns of each star, and 
therefore the nature of its beauty, could be affected by the actions of the 
star's man in our mundane world. I was shown some examples of how personality 
changes could cause changes in the star's pattern. Then I was given the 
opportunity to cause some temporary changes to my own star through manipulation 
of the patterns I have created over the years to describe my personality. For 
instance, I could see what the effect would come of moving Venus out of its. 
semisquare aspect to the Sun in my astrological chart. and into various other 
angular relationships.</p>

<p>I sang an impromptu prayer at this point. Something to this 
effect:</p>
<p>&quot;Oh beauteous Star, let us be identical, so that by at coming 
together we can dissolve all problems&quot;. The intent that drove this prayer was 
that there would be an intermixing of effect from man to star and from star to 
man, so that one could be changed permanently by changing the patterns in the 
other.</p>

<p>Nearly everything up to this point in the vision has been 
concerned with the Ruach as it is perceived from the path between Binah and 
Chokmah, which is the path of Tzaddi, The Star. in the system of symbols I use. 
At this paint in the vision I was instructed to leap back over the Abyss into 
the Ruach again. This was to show me that I could do so, and how to do it. This 
was important later in the vision. I leapt back to the Ruach, and back again 
into the Supernal triad.</p>

<p>The next section of the vision was concerned with the 
relationships between the first three sephiroth, and the paths between them. The 
quality of the vision changed. Where before all was beauty and glory and 
abundance, now the ambiance of the vision was of abstract, Bach-like structure 
contrasted with a counterpoint of indulgent good humor.</p>

<p>Many of the relationships revealed to me were shown in a +arm 
that does not convert into words with any clarity. Where I find a way to express 
them, I will include them in this narrative. Otherwise, just those parts that 
can be comprehended will be spoken of.</p>

<p>First was a vision of Binah as the &quot;doorstop&quot; that prevents 
the expansion of the Ruach to encompass the Supernals. By covering over the 
Ruach, and by forcing any exit from the Ruach to come through it, Binah/Saturn 
maintains the stability of the system. Otherwise, the Beast would devour all of 
the Tree of Life.</p>
<p>A voice said:&quot;The Binah revelation is Understanding. That 
which is understood is: There is no end to the arising of mysteries within the 
field of the Beast. Each of them compounds the mystery of what came before, and 
none is accessible to solution. But the mysteries are very, very beautiful for 
all their lack of purpose.'</p>
<p>Again, there was a vision of the Star, but each point within 
the Star was now one of the forces arising in the Ruach. Each force was again 
shown as being impenetrable in its essence. But it is the combination of these 
mysteries that creates the lovely patterns of the Star.</p>

<p>The voice again: &quot;The Chokmah revelation: The beauty of the 
Star is unsurpassed, but Wisdom says: Be Not Attached To It, for thereby is Joy 
transformed to Sorrow.''</p>

<p>Chokmah and Binah were shown to me as being not like the star 
of the Ruach, but like point-sources of very intense radiation, which thrust 
laser-like lines of radiance outwards in all directions. Much like Chakra at the 
top of the head.</p>

<p>Binah's wheel of radiance was shown to me first. It was 
lambent with purple and gold, with white and gold overlaying it. The power of 
the rays coursed through my body, and I felt that nothing could be of more power 
than this. But then the wheel of Chokmah came into vision from the right. Its 
lines of force were even more powerful, and were of a much finer rate of 
vibration. The white and gold became the predominant colors of the vision.</p>

<p>The power of these two running through my spirit-body 
produced a reaction in my physical body. My heart began missing beats, every 
nerve seemed to be tingling with fire, and the connection between my spirit-body 
and physical body became weakened to the point where I knew I could die if I 
just absorbed a little more force. But I hung on at the place where I was.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the rays of force from Chokmah and Binah relaxed 
and passed over beyond me. There stood revealed to my sight the center of Kether. 
Unlike the Second and Third sephiroth, it showed itself as a small star, but 
with a crown on it, and a hole in the center that was a gate to a larger world.</p>
<p>Closer examination of the star of Kether revealed that it was 
made up of rays of power just as were Chokmah and Binah. But its rays were so 
densely packed that they seemed a solid surface to anything the size of myself. 
I was told that I could enter into Kether's star by shrinking the radius of my 
being. by making myself so compact that I could slip between the rays.</p>


<p>I began to shrink in relation to the star of Kether. As I 
became smaller, I was drawn closer into Kether, so that rays streamed by me on 
all sides. Getting still smaller. I found that there was another shell of even 
more densely packed rays. in comparison with which I was still grossly large.</p>

<p>The shrinking began to go at an accelerating pace. The 
farther I shrank, the faster yet I shrank. I had a sense of rushing urgent force 
drawing me ever closer to the hole in the center of Kether. In the meantime, the 
effects an my physical body were increasing, and I knew that if I went much 
farther, I would lose my physical body. Just as it seemed that I was going to 
shrink into the proverbial dimensionless point and pass on out of Kether into 
the beyond, I exerted my will and held back, forcing myself to stay within the 
area of the Tree of Life, forcing myself back down the Tree and into the Ruach.</p>

<p>The voice said: &quot;This is the Kether revelation: That we are 
here by our Will only. that nothing stands beyond to hold us here.''</p>

<p>It seemed as if I was holding myself away +ram Kether by a 
line of will, holding it at a distance the way a man can brace himself against a 
sucking force a+ wind or water. Eventually I gained some distance from Kether, 
and it became easier to hold myself away from that dreadful pull. I came down 
into Tiphereth. and there the voice said: &quot;The second side a+ beauty, that its 
attractiveness gives anchor to our will when will must be used elsewhere&quot;. I was 
shown that the line of Will that I had extruded was the path of Shin, connecting 
Kether with Tiphereth. Tiphereth is the point of balance between the earth of 
Malkuth and the Heavens of Kether. it is the lowest point at which Will holds 
full sway over existence. The will anchors to it and uses it as a transformer. 
passing its force on into the lower worlds by proxy. I was reminded by the voice 
of the connection between this vision and the gematraic demonstration I had once 
made that the paths of Shin and Tzaddi together were the &quot;props'' or supports of 
the heavenly hexagram in the Tree of Life.</p>

<p>Having stabilized myself, I returned to Kether. The shrinking 
again began to take place, but this time I did not resist it. The pull drew me 
down to a paint and I passed through Kether and out of this world. </p>

<p>On the other side of the whole there was Nothing, literally. 
All that could be experienced was an absence of all that we deem to be 
&quot;existence&quot; in the world of the Tree. The Tree itself could still be seen, 
looking like a living crystal in the darkness. Of all else, there was naught.</p>

<p>I remained a dimensionless point of awareness floating just 
above Kether in this nothingness. As I remarked on this, a voice said &quot;Hadith&quot;. 
I took this to indicate that Hadith is expressed in the Veils of the Negative as 
the point a+ intense concentration that makes the inflowing of force into Kether 
possible. Hadith was the Ain, nothing. Being without dimension, he is without 
observable characteristics, and is therefore &quot;nothing&quot;.</p>

<p>Looking about away from Kether, I saw that my point was 
surrounded by a darkness of a curiously rich quality. It was as if the darkness 
had a sensory quality somewhat akin to thick velvet. There was something 
womb-like about it, as if it enclosed and nurtured me with a gentle warmth. At 
the same time, I could perceive no ending to it, no outer boundary. As I noticed 
this. the voice said, &quot;Nuith&quot;. I saw this as meaning that Nuit is embodied in 
the Veils of the Negative as Ain Soph. Without Limit, a universal or 
hyperuniversal plenum in which all events take place. The phrase &quot;the stars in 
the womb of Nuit&quot; came to mind. a paraphrase of something in Liber Al vel Legis.</p>

<p>As I examined this darkness, I felt an outflowing of force 
from myself. and an inflowing of force from around me. The darkness became 
enlightened with an amazing light that seemed to be all colors simultaneously, 
but with each color still individually identifiable. Sheets and flames and 
tongues of light flew all about in a bewildering variety,, filling all of the 
nothingness out to its non-existent limits. The voice said &quot;Ra-Hoor-Khuti&quot;, 
meaning, Ra-HoorKhuti is the limitless light, or Ain Soph Aur of the Veils if 
the Negative. He is the child of the darkness and of the point of awareness that 
enlivens the dark. He is the source of the energy with which all of the Tree of 
Life was built.</p>

<p>This power of the light grew stronger and stronger, and again 
I felt that my body was failing. I was given the choice again: Die now, and 
learn the full revelation, or return to the Tree and save the full truth for a 
later time. My body was not presently able to withstand the full perception of 
the Ain.</p>

<p>I returned to the top of Kether, and used my anchor in 
Tiphereth to pull me back into the Tree. Coming into Kether again, it seemed as 
if I had absorbed so much force from the Ain that I was going to die despite my 
efforts not to. My astral body would not phase in with my physical body. It 
resisted the linkage seemingly because the body could not hold all that force. I 
could feel it radiating out into the world, and even the small part that did 
come into the body was enough to send the heart into fibrillations. With a sense 
of desperation, I forced myself into the body, knowing that if it was to be 
stabilized again. my direct conscious attention to its functioning was 
necessary. Using my will, I caused my heart to slow to its normal pace, which it 
did suddenly, between one heartbeat and the next.</p>

<p>The remainder of the force I had carried back from the Ain 
eventually radiated off, allowing my body to come fully back to normal. I felt 
my consciousness slowly coming back down into the Ruach. I felt that perhaps I 
had missed something by not taking the plunge and going fully into the Ain, no 
matter the consequences. I knew that I would not be able to carry the scope of 
that revelation back into my normal consciousness, and I regretted it.</p>

<p>As if to comfort me, the voice that had been with me all 
through this vision had one last comment. It reminded me of the verse in Liber 
Legis that goes: &quot;He who lives long and desires Death much is ever a king among 
kings. &quot;</p>
