<H5>Generating the &quot;Abyss&quot; Experience with the Temple
</H5>

<P>
<EM>WARNING: The technique described herein can be VERY DANGEROUS
to the emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being of the magician
who makes use of it. I am releasing it solely because full disclosure
was one of the requirements under which the Enochian Temple system
was originally given to me. The entities who provided the basic
information feel that people can not grow to spiritual adulthood
without being exposed to adult hazards. My experience of the results
prevents me from being quite so cold-blooded. The same goals can
be accomplished by more gradual means, as those entities have
stated themselves. The magician who choses to use this technique
must take full personal responsibility for both the decision to
do so, and for any events resulting from its use.</EM> 
<P>
<EM>Should a magician want use it despite this warning, he or
she should do so only after constructing a strong, fully charged
Temple which includes the altars of the sub-elements. And any
invocations using this technique should be immediately preceded
by the erection of the strongest wards the magician is capable
of constructing.</EM> 
<P>
The names of a Tablet's Seniors can be formed into a table on
their own by placing their names one above the other, going clockwise
from the Senior of Jupiter. For the Earth Tablet, the table of
the Seniors would be:
<P>
A C Z I N O R
<P>
L Z I N O P O
<P>
A L H C T G A
<P>
L I I A N S A
<P>
A H M L I C V
<P>
L A I D R O M
<P>
Similar pseudo-tablets can be formed from the other elemental
tablets. Names of six letters are formed by reading down the columns.
These names already exist in the Temple, where they are formed
by drawing a circle clockwise from any square of the Senior of
Jupiter, connecting the corresponding squares in the other Seniors'
names. In their natural place, they express the radiatory effect
of the Elemental King as his force passes out along the paths
provided by the Seniors. But the names can also be used in another
way.
<P>
First, hollow hexagons are formed, as in figure ( ), one-half
unit thick with outer faces one unit wide. Each letter of a name
is assigned to one of the wedge-like segments of this structure
in clockwise succession. Each name's hexagon is placed immediately
below the corresponding arm in the wheel of the Seniors, about
two-thirds of the way from the center of the Temple to the end
of the arm, with the base side at the same level as the tops of
the pillars. The hexagon attributed to the Sun is in the center
of the upper Temple, with the Elemental King's beam passing through
the hole.
<P>
In the chart as given above, the columns are attributed (from
left to right) to Venus, Sun, Saturn, Earth/Luna, Jupiter, Mercury,
and Mars. When used in invocations, the name should be vibrated
immediately after that of the King or corresponding Senior, and
at no other time. Also, the first enochian key should always precede
the invocation of the element when these names are used. When
they are visualized in the upper Temple, an appropriate telesmatic
image for the Senior (or the god-form of the related planet) should
be visualized standing upright above (not in) the hollow center.1
The magician himself should stand in the beam of the King while
invoking them, and attempt to identify himself with it to the
greatest extent possible.
<P>
As the Elemental King and each Senior is invoked with the corresponding
name from the table, the hexagon should be visualized as projecting
itself downwards into the lower temple, forming a hollow crystal
column. The force of the King or Senior is channeled down through
the column and then radiates outward through the faces. (This
is in contrast to the normal Temple formulation, where the Seniors'
force spreads out to form a curtain around the lower Temple.)
<P>
In the Enochian system, six of the planets are attributed to the
first six sephiroth of the Tree of Life. The seventh, Saturn,
takes in the last four sephiroth as a group. In the formulation
here, the Senior of Saturn takes Sol's place in Tiphereth as the
governor of the elements, and the Elemental King abandons his
solar attributes, taking on his secondary attribution to the path
of Shin, which connects Tiphereth and Kether in Achad's version
of the Tree of Life.
<P>
In the Tree of Life, the centralizing effect of Sol normally causes
the forces of the upper Tree to be focused in Tiphereth. But when
Sol's force is repressed or removed, the balance of these sephiroth
moves to the empty area in the center of the upper Tree. The path
of Shin passes through this area, but it does not provide any
focus for the forces of the six sephiroth.2 Each of the sephiroth
becomes focused in itself, and the attractive force of each draws
equally on the empty center area. That area experiences a uniform
pull outwards in all directions, resulting in the rending and
dispersal of anything placed there. A conscious being passing
up the path of Shin perceives this effect as the experience of
the Abyss.
<P>
Normally, the Enochian Temple expresses the essential unity of
the Tablets with the whole Tree of Life as a balanced, integrated
structure. Using the technique presented here suppresses that
integrity and replaces it with a strong force towards dispersion.
The magician, identified with the Elemental King's beam of light,
places himself to experience the full strength of that dispersion.
<P>
Depending on the degree of success, the magician may experience
a variety of perceptions. At the least intense level, he may experience
sensations of inexplicable &quot;wrongness&quot; and non-specific
paranoia, or a sense of jittery energy like an overdose of methedrine.
At a somewhat more intense level, he will experience a sense of
his soul being ripped into extremely small pieces, while each
piece is simultaneously being crushed to a point.
<P>
At full force, the experience then evolves into what can only
be called the perception of voidness; the negation, the removal
of any being or value from absolutely everything perceptible,
both internal and external. The intensity of this voidness can
not be adequately described. At this stage the paranoia sometimes
returns, causing the magician to perceive the voidness as an all-consuming
malevolent entity. Giving in to this paranoia, struggling to avoid
being devoured, brings one on to the path of those whom Crowley
calls the Black Brothers. If one does not struggle, that which
perceives is itself absorbed into the void and another condition
supervenes for which description is futile.

2 The idea that an eleventh sephira exists in this position is
one of the most vile lies ever perpetrated. It is unfortunate
that some otherwise competent scholars have made their reputations
by spreading it even further. While there is the appearance of
something occupying the center of the hexagram when it is viewed
from lower down in the Tree, this appearance is entirely hallucinatory.
The Tiphereth consciousness merely sees a reflection of itself
in the surface of the Great Sea, as a skin diver sees a distorted
reflection of himself in the waves above his head.<HR>
