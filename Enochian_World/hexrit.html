<H5>Comments</H5>

<P>
0.0 I had two main objectives in writing this ritual. The first
was to adjust the symbolism of the G.D. version so that it fully
reflected the INRI formula. While the G.D. version starts with
INRI, the primary symbolism is based on the formula of IAO. These
two formulas are superficially similar but far apart in their
detailed symbolism and areas of applicability.
<P>
IAO is a generalized formula of consecration. One takes a material
basis (I = Isis = nature or matter) and applies a magickal energy
to it (A = Apophis = energy), raising its rate of vibration and
producing an influential radiance (O = Osiris = Sol). There are
specialized interpretations for specific methods of working, but
most of them can be reduced to this general description of the
process. A study of the G.D. rituals shows that they made no distinction
between an initiatory ritual applied to a human candidate and
a consecration ritual to charge a talisman. The candidate was
considered to be mere &quot;base matter&quot; whose nature could
only be changed by application of an external force.
<P>
 On the other hand, INRI is a both a creative and an initiatory
formula. As a creative formula, it shows the steps in the creative
process as they are performed by either a man or a god. As an
initiatory formula, it describes the stages of the path of initiation
as they are experienced by the individual who is actively seeking
to raise his own level of consciousness, not as a passive recipient
of external force, but as the instigator and prime mover of the
work. Beyond this, INRI reflects processes that are at the root
of all human behavior and have pervaded every area of human activity
at least since the beginning of our recorded history.
<P>
 The symbolism of INRI is dealt with briefly further on in these
comments. An expanded treatment of the formula is presented in
my paper Set / Horus, for those who wish to consult it.
<P>
My second objective in revising the Hexagram ritual was to produce
a version that was suitable for use with the Enochian Calls. This
current version uses only Enochian divine names, and the symbolism
of the circle and directions has been modified to conform more
closely to that given in Dee's records of the Enochian magickal
system. Complete conformity is not possible, since Dee's interpretations
are sometimes contradictory. But I have selected out of his interpretations
those that seem most consistent.
<P>
0.1 For daily use, the tools and accoutrements should be kept
simple. One wand, robe, and lamen are sufficient. Robe and lamen
may also be dispensed with under most circumstances. Dee's lamen
is appropriate to this work, since it is derived from the names
of angels of the planets.
<P>
For this work, &quot;theurgic&quot; is meant to include any work
for self-initiatory purposes, any work to generate links between
the magician and more evolved beings (or to invoke such beings
to visible appearance), any work in which the magician himself
is the object to which the invoked forces are to be applied. &quot;Thaumaturgic&quot;
includes all works done with intent to influence mundane events
and objects, or persons in their mundane capacities; all works
of invoking non- material beings of less than a human level of
evolution (demons, elementals, Enochian &quot;cacodemons&quot;);
consecrations of talismans and other works involving a material
basis other than the magician.
<P>
1.0 The symbolism of motion around the circle varies slightly
from traditional usage. Both banishings and invocations can involve
motion in either direction. It is the intent of the work that
determines the direction used. The directions chosen here follow
a consistent pattern expressed by the Enochian spirits in my contacts
with them. When speaking of circular motion in relation to mundane
or external events they always refer to motion in the same direction
as the Sun's motion around the zodiac, which is widdershins when
viewed from the Earth's northern hemisphere. When speaking of
circular motion in relation to initiation or spiritual evolution,
they always refer to motion in the direction of the precession
of the equinoxes, which is deosil.
<P>
1.1 The Enochian word declares the commencement of the ritual.
&quot;Amgedpha&quot; means &quot;I begin anew&quot;. This is one
of the words spoken by a god at the beginning of any cycle of
creation.
<P>
2.1 The position of the wand indicates that the flow of energy
in this section of the ritual will be in the vertical direction,
as opposed to horizontal or cyclical motion.
<P>
2.2 - 2.5  INRI is a reversible formula. That is, it is equally
valid when read from either end. The standard form of the formula
in the first spoken line is the creative or &quot;involutionary&quot;
version, representing power descending into manifestation from
the Godhead. The reversed form in the second spoken line is the
initiatory or &quot;evolutionary&quot; version, representing the
re-ascent of man from complete involvement with matter back to
the Godhead. Thus the two together represent one complete cycle
of existence.
<P>
The chakras activated as each letter is spoken are the correspondences
in the body to the principles represented by the letters. They
also roughly correspond to the parts of the Tree of Life with
which each of the letters is connected. The activation of the
chakras in the order shown should also remind the magician of
the cycle of in-breathing and out-breathing of energy in pranayama,
which is representative of the same universal cycle in the symbolism
of the Eastern initiatory systems.
<P>
In point 2.5, the four principles of INRI are elaborated by their
divine correspondences. The passage of the energy back out of
the head in four streams represents the idea that from a cosmic
viewpoint the entire Tree of Life is but the physical plane of
some higher-order system, and that the manifestation of these
principles must have its origin in corresponding activities within
that larger system.
<P>
3.1 - 3.2 The evolutionary form, IRNI, describes both the characteristic
stages of the life of a man in the world (&quot;the passage of
man through the Earth&quot;), and the four major stages of the
initiatory journey (&quot;the passage from Earth to the Stars&quot;).
<P>
The first verse in point 3.2 describes these four stages in terms
of the classic &quot;Hero's Life&quot; mythos. In its simplest
form, this pattern is present in most hero tales from nearly all
past cultures. The hero is normally the child of a king, who has
been hidden away for his protection during childhood. He grows
up ignorant of his future destiny (first &quot;I&quot;, Earth).
At some point he is made aware of that destiny, and begins the
struggle to make it real. After various battles and confrontations,
he wins and becomes the King (&quot;R&quot;, Mars-Sol). At the
height of his accomplishment he dies or is betrayed and killed
(&quot;N&quot;, Scorpio). After death, he rises to heaven and
becomes a god (last &quot;I&quot;, Mercury or Thoth). King Arthur
is typical of this mythos. The story of Christ also follows the
pattern, save that his powers are magickal rather than martial.
<P>
 A slightly more sophisticated version is shown in the history
of Siddhartha, the Buddha. Having gone through the first two stages
and become a ruling prince, Siddhartha is suddenly exposed to
the suffering that is the burden of the people he rules. He sees
that some of their suffering was inadvertently caused by himself,
and much more of it can not be alleviated even by his princely
powers. This revelation affects him so strongly that he abandons
all his possessions and powers and goes into the wastelands, dedicating
himself to discovering the solution to suffering. He spends years
concentrating on the work to the exclusion of all else. (Suffering,
rejection of the past, and intense concentration are all aspects
of Scorpio.)
<P>
 Eventually he succeeds and attains wisdom. He then goes about
telling others of the principles and techniques necessary to achieving
the freedom that he has attained. (Wisdom = Thoth as god of Chokmah,
spreading of the methods = Mercury as god of communication. Note
also that Buddha's methods are primarily intellectual, again equating
to Mercury.)
<P>
 The Grail Knights show a Christianized version of the Buddha's
story, in their rejection of earthly glory in favor of going through
the trials that lead to heavenly glory. Like the Buddha, they
voluntarily leave the King's palace, and go into the wastelands
in search of their goal.
<P>
 In the life of the typical &quot;traveler on the Path&quot;,
these four mythical stages correspond to four psychological stages:
<P>
 First &quot;I&quot; - the period of normal human life-in-the-world,
in which the person sees himself primarily as an earthly or physical
being, with the &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Savior&quot;
as something outside himself.
<P>
&quot;R&quot; - That period when the individual's soul begins
to make itself felt. The person is thrown into a state of conflict,
a constant fight, as his soul struggles to overcome the inertia
of his earthly personality and gain control of the lower being.
Eventually the Soul succeeds in overcoming the personality and
becomes the ruler of the incarnate being.
<P>
 &quot;N&quot; - The soul spends a period of time, often several
lifetimes, enjoying its power and the additional influence it
has over its affairs in the manifest worlds. But eventually the
novelty fades, and the soul begins to perceive that it is not
the true ruler of its own actions, that its supposed freedom is
largely illusory. It perceives that its existence is the result
of the dynamic tension between the material worlds and the power
of the spirit. In order to achieve true freedom it sees that must
throw off all of that part of itself that derives from the material
pole of existence, and become one with the spiritual pole. Since
its very existence in its present form results from the interaction
of spirit and matter, the act of throwing off the influence of
the material portion of its being must inevitably result in the
destruction of that form. Hence the symbolism of Death that prevails
in descriptions of this stage.
<P>
 Last &quot;I&quot; - Becoming detached from the material side
frees the former soul from the wheel of birth and death, and it
becomes the Universal Mercury, conscious intelligence free of
any individual characteristics; fluid, perfectly adaptable in
the Mercurial manner. Eventually it frees itself entirely by drawing
itself to a point (the Yod as the Point of Kether), and vanishes
from the worlds of our Tree of Life entirely.
<P>
3.2 The second of the two verses in point 3.2 expresses the creative
<P>
form of INRI, in which the flow of power is from Kether down to
Malkuth. Briefly put:
<P>
 Thoth is god of the sphere of the fixed stars, which is also
the sphere of the Word, or primal pattern on which the eventual
manifestation is based.
<P>
 Set is the god ruling the part of the Tree wherein lies the so-called
&quot;Abyss&quot;, which is the interface between the essential
unity of the supernal triad and the inherent duality of the Ruach.
In one myth, Set tears Osiris to pieces and buries the pieces
in the Earth. Similarly, in transforming the divine Word into
its &quot;material&quot; equivalent in the Ruach, its unity must
be translated into paired dualities, or complementary ideas. Thus
he &quot;divides the poles&quot;.
<P>
 Horus as a Solar god relates all these divided pieces of the
Word to each other, coordinating them into a form which reflects
their original intent as closely as is possible within the lower
worlds. He produces the soul-form on which the eventual manifestation
will be based. His coordinating and activating power draws the
matter of the lower worlds into a &quot;magnetic alignment&quot;
with the solar form.
<P>
Isis represents the matter that is drawn to the solar form, which
in turn draws more matter to itself, absorbing the power of the
solar form, slowing it, and eventually producing a concrete manifestation
of the original intent.
<P>
4.0 - 6.11 Concerning the elements and the four directions:
<P>
 Dee perceived the magickal circle as a representation in two
dimensions of the three-dimensional sphere of the heavens, in
much the same way as a horoscope chart.1 A horoscope is a representation
of the fusion of macrocosm and microcosm at one specific point
in time. Since we are attempting to produce a manifestation of
the representatives of the macrocosmic forces in the Tablets,
this symbolism seems very appropriate. The four directions in
the circle become the four &quot;angles&quot; of the horoscope,
with the east being the ascendant, the west the descendant, the
south the midheaven and the north the nadir.
<P>
 Because the &quot;angles&quot; of the magickal circle are at
right angles to each other, they will always fall into one of
the zodiacal quadruplicities, and therefore each angle will always
be in a sign whose element is different from the other three.
The relative positions of the four elements will always be the
same. If we start with Air, then the next angle deosil will always
be Water, next after that Fire, and last Earth.
<P>
 The decision to assign the elements to the angles as is done
in this ritual stems from several considerations:
<P>
a) Since this ritual is primarily intended for invoking planetary
forces, the elements should be treated according to their &quot;heavenly&quot;
positions, as they are in relation to each other in the zodiac,
rather than in their traditional mundane directions.
<P>
 b) The element of Earth should be placed in the north because
the planet Earth is always, by definition, in the nadir of a horoscope.
<P>
c) The element of Air should be in the East, because it is traditionally
assigned to this direction, and because Air is the &quot;highest&quot;
of the elements in the ordering of the Enochian system and thus
should be the first of the four invoked. Also, the ascendant of
the horoscope represents the coming of new things into the person's
sphere of awareness, and an Air sign, Aquarius, is the zodiacal
attribute of the incoming astrological &quot;Age&quot;. The two
elements of Water and Fire are then attributed to the remaining
directions according to their positions in a zodiacal quadruplicity.
<P>
 This arrangement works well in practice, but is not &quot;locked
in stone&quot;. One could find good excuses for using other arrangements.
The G.D. arrangement treats the four directions as representing
the equinoxes and solstices, so would be equally appropriate.
Or one could follow one of Dee's arrangements and attribute the
elements to the quarters between the angles rather than to the
angles themselves.
<P>
 In section 6, this foursquare arrangement is abandoned, in favor
of another based on the relative positions of the Seniors in any
one of the Tablets. The upper and lower arms of the Great Cross
of the Tablet
<P>
are simply separated into their two &quot;lines&quot; or columns
and bent outwards to make a six-pointed figure. The planets are
grouped with the astrologically &quot;masculine&quot; planets
to the west and the astrologically &quot;feminine&quot; planets
to the east, with complementary planets balanced against each
other across the circle. By invoking the planets in two sets of
three rather than going in order around the circle, a balance
is maintained between the two polarities. Also note that each
triad contains planets that are correspondences (within a purely
astrological viewpoint) of the alchemical principles of sulphur
- mercury - salt.
<P>
4.0 - 6.11 Miscellaneous remarks
<P>
 Section 4: The intent of this section is to invoke the most macrocosmic
(and therefore most generalized) form of the powers. The Tablet
of Union names invoke the spirit of the elements. Each of the
Three Names of God for the elements corresponds to an astrological
sign, and all four sets together make up the Zodiac.
<P>
 There are actually two zodiacal correspondences for each name,
which are used in different circumstances. The reasons for this
are too complicated to go into here. For this ritual, the following
table shows the correspondences to be used.
<PRE>
        Mutable         Fixed           Cardinal
Air	ORO             IBAH            AOZPI
Water   MPH	        ARSL            GAIOL
Earth   MOR	        DIAL            HCTGA
Fire	OIP             TEAA            PDOCE
</PRE>

<P>
 When projecting into the elemental realms, it would be fitting
to visualize symbols appropriate to the zodiacal attributes as
an added attractant for the inhabitants. The purpose behind the
attempt to see or sense these inhabitants is to create mental
links between them and the magician, and to strengthen any links
previously established. It is by means of these links that the
knowledge embodied in the Tablets can be acquired.
<P>
It is quite common for an invocation of the Names of God to attract
a myriad of small elementals. But they do not have much energy
to spare, and are useless as sources of information. Their presence
is a sign of success in performing the ritual, but it is the more
