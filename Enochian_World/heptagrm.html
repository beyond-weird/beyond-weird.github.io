The magickal circle has the Heptagram inscribed, with its points
touching the circle. Topmost point directed east. Glyphs of the
planets or other appropriate sigillia should be drawn within the
angles of the Heptagram. For invocations, the lotus wand or a
planetary wand should be used. Either wand or the sword may be
used for banishings.
<P>

<H5>Symbolism and Visualizations.</H5>

<P>
1: This brief ritual was designed as a general planetary invocation
and banishing, to be used when invoking the Heptarchic Royalty
and the angels of the Table of the 49 Good Angels. The symbolism
of these divine beings is based on the number seven rather than
six, with Sol being treated as one among equals, instead of being
given a place of primacy. The ritual can also be used as a substitute
for the Hexagram Ritual in other, non-Heptarchic workings.
<P>
The preferred form of the Heptagram is the G.D. version. Going
clockwise from the topmost point, the planets are attributed to
the points in the order of their apparent rate of motion, from
slowest to fastest. This is identical with the order of their
corresponding sephiroth in the Tree of Life. I use this ordering
because when the Heptagram is drawn, the planets' points are touched
in the order of the days of the week. Thus this version of the
Heptagram embodies both macrocosmic and microcosmic aspects of
the planetary powers.
<P>
The orientation of Heptagram inscribed in the magickal circle
is arbitrary. One can make valid arguments for several different
orientations, and the magician should use the orientation that
fits his own preferences.
<P>
To draw the invoking heptagram of a planet, start at the point
attributed to the planet and move clockwise. The banishing Heptagram
is drawn by starting at the same point and going counter-clockwise.
The glyph of the planet is drawn in the center of the completed
Heptagram.
<P>
2: Points 2 and 3 of this ritual describe a complete cycle. Point
2 represents the raising of the Earth to the stars by expansion
of the elementally-based formula of INRI/IRNI to include the entire
Tree of Life. Point 3 represents the response of the macrocosmos
being fixed in matter.
<P>
The spoken portion of point 2 is a revision of the G.D. Hexagram
ritual and the keyword INRI to conform with an initiatory system
shown to me by the Enochian spirits. This system is described
in the chapbook Enochian Temples and the related papers in the
Archives. Readers interested in the fine details of the system
should consult those documents. Briefly, this system divides the
Tree of Life into four sections instead of the three major divisions
of the G.D. system, and views initiation as a more dynamic process
than the G.D. does. The four stages are:
<P>
Isis - Lunar-planetary stage. Corresponds to the Outer Order of
the G.D. system. Elemental Earth, astrological Virgo.
<P>
Horus - Solar-planetary stage. Corresponds to the transitional
grades between the Outer Order and the Order of the Rose Cross,
the grade of Adeptus Minor, and the paths between that grade and
the full Adept grades. Elemental fire, astrologically Sol/Aries.
<P>
Set - Solar-systemic stage. Corresponds to the full Adept grades,
and the paths connecting these grades with the grades of Magister
Templi and Magus. Elemental water, astrologically Scorpio.
<P>
Thoth or Nepthys - Cosmic stage. Corresponds to the &quot;Secret
Chiefs&quot; of the G.D., or the Order of the A.A. in Crowley's
system. Normally Thoth is attributed to the last I of IRNI as
ruler of the Sphere of the Fixed Stars. In this ritual Nepthys,
in her aspect as a goddess of perfection, is substituted to maintain
a balance between the masculine and feminine forces. Elemental
Air, astrologically Mercury / Aquarius (Thoth) or Libra (Nepthys).
<P>
Thelemic magicians might want to consider the correspondence between
these four gods and the thelemic quadruplicity of Babalon, Horus,
Hadit, and Nuit. There is also a strong correspondence between
the IRNI formula and the fixed zodiacal signs of Taurus, Leo,
Scorpio, and Aquarius.
<P>
The ritual begins with the sign of Osiris because it is Osiris,
humanity, that passes through these four stages of initiation.
The sign of Osiris Risen is used instead of Osiris Slain because
Man must have conquered the worlds of the elements and become
the Pentagram before he can enter into the purely planetary realms.
The magician affirms that he has accomplished this task by giving
the sign.
<P>
The first three spoken lines are an abstract analysis of the keyword,
along the same lines as the G.D. Hexagram Ritual. The next line
celebrates both action of the IRNI formula and the purpose of
the ritual. IRNI links the Earth with the stars by encompassing
the Tree. The ceremony links the Earth with the stars because
the sephiroth with planetary attributes lie between Malkuth and
Chokmah, sphere of the fixed stars. The line also links the abstract
preceding three lines with the concrete and qualitative descriptions
of the following four lines, to make the holy seven that is the
basis of the ritual.
<P>
The final four lines describe the attributes of the four initiatory
stages and the corresponding parts of the Tree through commemoration
of the relevant characteristics of the gods. As these lines are
recited, the gods should be visualized at the four quarters, in
backgrounds suggestive of the qualities mentioned. For instance,
Isis could be seen standing amidst lush vegetation, Horus standing
above a battlefield strewn with the bodies of his enemies, etc.
<P>
3: In invoking the planets, the lines of the Heptagram are followed
in order to tie the planetary powers to the Earth. Invoking each
point in order clockwise does not seem to produce as stable a
manifestation. The large Heptagram within the circle can be viewed
as the Heptagram of Earth, and the invoked powers as its sub-aspects.
The magickal image of the planet or its sephira should be visualized
standing beyond each Heptagram after it is drawn.
<P>
The invocation of the planets uses the Hebrew planet names and
god-names. The English following each planet's name is a loose
translation of the Hebrew inserted purely for emphasis. The variations
in phrasing in the invocations of Luna, Mercury, and Venus (&quot;enlivens
you&quot;, &quot;moves you&quot;, &quot;is your god&quot;) are
a cabalistic pun on the old Theosophical phrase concerning the
worlds in which the uninitiated man &quot;Lives, and moves, and
has his being&quot;. The sephiroth corresponding to these planets
are the cabalistic equivalents of the Theosophical worlds.
<P>
The planet names are used first, to emphasize that the planets
are not merely points of light in the sky expressing the Assiatic
aspect of cosmic forces, but the bodies of beings expressing themselves
in all four worlds; beings whose power and nature qualifies them
as gods in their own right.
<P>
Our magickal conception of the universe should always conform
to the known facts of physical reality. Prior to the advent of
space travel, our subjective experience of the planets as moving
points of light was more or less in conformance with the limited
objective view. But telecommunications and space probes have now
provided us with a clearer perspective on their true nature. The
subjective experience is now shown to be only a product of our
relative locations in space.
<P>
But while the new objective view invalidates the naive subjective
view of the planets, it actually enhances the magickal view of
their natures. Each of the known planets has at least one outstanding
physical characteristic that is a perfect correspondence to the
traditional magickal view of its nature and powers. For instance,
Saturn's rings are a graphic symbol of its restrictive and limiting
nature. Mars' surface is covered with iron, the traditional metal
of the planet. Mars also has the largest volcano in the solar
system, an order of magnitude larger than any on Earth, confirming
the traditional violence of its nature.
<P>
A similar alteration must be made in our view of the Earth. She
is still the sphere of the Elements - nowhere else in the solar
system are they as active as here. Her place as the life-holder
is also still secure. But the traditional magickal view of the
Earth as the material pole of the matter-spirit duality has to
be modified.
<P>
Our space explorations have shown that matter is much the same
elsewhere in the solar system as it is here. There is no reason
to think that this sameness can not be extended to the rest of
the universe. The Earth is in no way more &quot;material&quot;
than any other place. Our perception of the Earth as different
in some way from the rest of the universe is purely subjective,
and completely relative.
<P>
Further, matter itself has proven to be much different from the
naive subjective view. Beneath its seeming palpability is another
world of sub-atomic particles; and the further scientists delve
into that smaller world, the more it seems that there might be
an even smaller world, and smaller worlds yet beyond that one.
<P>
The same is true in the physical macrocosm. We have pushed our
conception of the universe to the theoretical limits of direct
knowledge, but our knowledge and the very structure of our conception
is beginning to demand that we conceive that universe as being
but a limited, relatively local phenomenon, a bubble in some meta-universal
stream of activity.
<P>
So our view of the physical universe is proving to be only a slice,
a range of phenomena in a continuum whose true limits are beyond
our perception, perhaps beyond our ability to conceive. Following
the law of correspondences the subjective spirit-matter duality
described by the Tree of Life must also be seen as a section of
a larger continuum; beyond the horizon of our perception in both
the spiritual and material directions must exist other realms
as yet unperceived. Neither Malkuth nor Kether is an absolute
limit to existence, but both are merely the horizon beyond which
we can not presently see. Malkuth may be seen as the Kether of
some sub-microcosmic Tree, and Kether the Malkuth of a larger
Tree.
<P>
Under this conception, we must abandon the idea of the Earth being
irrevocably tied to Malkuth. Viewed from the spatial perspective
she actually encloses the elements, and the life she holds, within
herself. Therefore she is properly placed in Binah. Under this
same conception Saturn, representing limitation, the &quot;horizon&quot;
beyond which we can not see but only speculate, can be taken out
of Binah and more properly placed in Malkuth.
<P>
The astrological characters of the two planets have always supported
such a move -- a fact that has been indirectly recognized by many
writers as early as the Golden Dawn era. There is no obvious reason
why the change has not been proposed formally before now. Perhaps
it is the fact that the Hebrew divine names are the only truly
effective means of evocation that has been available, and the
Hebrew system is based entirely on the naive, subjective view
in which the Earth was an infinite expanse of stone totally separated
from the ethereal realms above. The only system of comparable
effectiveness, the Enochian system, as yet lacks a framework for
invoking the powers of the planets themselves, though the Heptarchy
provides an avenue to those powers through angelic intermediaries.
