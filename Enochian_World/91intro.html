<P>
The price of initiation is to be ceaselessly
surprised; to live in a world where the only certainty is that
what you believe to be Truth, believe to be real, even what you
believe to be yourself will be changed in ways that you cannot
anticipate. No matter how great our knowledge and experience,
it is always surrounded by the infinite darkness of the unknown;
and out of that darkness things can come at any moment to transform
our world.
<P>
One must advance towards the darkness
without fear. Not because there is nothing to fear; rather because
fear forces the unknown into its own ugly shape, a shape that
we all know too well. Nothing truly new can come into our consciousness
while fear dominates. Deny fear its power, deny it any right to
control you, and the magickal universe becomes a place of endlessly
unfolding wonders. Embrace the unknown and it will reward you
by opening up its unspeakable, astonishing variety.
<P>
More than most people, I hunger after
that variety; hunger for it as intensely as an adolescent boy
hungers for sex. That which is routine, that which is known, that
which is familiar hold no attraction for me; I find them oppressive.
The settled territories of the magickal world, I leave to others;
only in pushing into the unknown am I fulfilled. 
<P>
The Enochian magick provides a perfect
tool for one such as I. Its depth appears to be infinite; understand
one level of its reality, and a new one with different properties
opens immediately. A lifetime of work cannot exhaust its potential.

<P>
But penetrating its depths can be difficult,
for an unusual reason. That is that the Enochian entities are
too cooperative. They strive always to conform their actions to
the will of the magician. This means that if the magician enters
into their realm with specific expectations, they will seek to
fulfill those expectations, even if it means overlaying a true
picture of the realm with a false one.
<P>
Aleister Crowley's visions of the Thirty
Aethyrs provide a case in point. Before he ever invoked one, he
had decided that the Aethyrs represented a particular structure,
with each triad of Aethyrs being associated with one of the Sephiroth
in sequence. Further, at the time he did the visions, he added
an additional expectation by interpreting the letters of the Aethyr's
name according to the Golden Dawn's attributes. The results he
obtained in these visions precisely reflected the forms and levels
that he expected to see. 
<P>
Ten years ago I discovered the magnitude
of this problem by accident. On a whim, I decided to do visions
of the &quot;Kerubic&quot; angels of the Earth Tablet. I had no
particular goal in mind, so I told the angels that they had complete
freedom in their presentations; they could show me whatever they
wanted to of their nature and that of their realms. Up to that
time, I had been using the standard Golden Dawn attributes for
the Tablets; the results I now obtained were entirely at odds
with everything I had gotten before. 
<P>
This so intrigued me that I decided
to continue the practice with other parts of the Enochian hierarchy,
taking particular care to avoid placing any limits on the actions
of the angels, being completely open to whatever they wanted to
say. The results were nothing less than astounding; I received
more new and useful information in the next six months than I
had in the previous seven years of work.
<P>
These visions of the 91 &quot;Parts
of the Earth&quot; were begun in a similar spirit. I started them
on a whim; traffic was slow in the NuitNet &quot;Enochian&quot;
echo, and I wanted something to post to show people it was still
an active echo. I had no particular expectations with respect
to the results; simply that they be something that might interest
others. As I write this (with 29 of the 91 Parts explored) I have
no idea where the series will end. Every time I start to suspect
some logic behind it, it veers off in an unexpected direction.
I am deliberately refusing to look for any overall pattern until
after the series is completed in a few years.
<P>
The &quot;Parts of the Earth&quot; derive
from John Dee's <I>Liber Scientiae</I>. The book is a tabulation
of these Parts, along with their groupings under the Aethyrs and
certain other information. The purpose of the books, as told to
Dee, was to provide him with a means of magickally influencing
the governments of various countries. (This stated purpose may
have been a consequence of Dee's own expectations; he was greatly
intent on having such a tool.)
<P>
Each Part is a region of the Earth as
defined by God; each corresponds to a particular geographic/political
locale in the world as it was known in 16th-Century England. (As
the reader will see, in these visions some of the Parts are attributed
to regions then unknown.) Additionally, the Parts have a &quot;vertical&quot;
or hierarchic component to their natures, because they are connected
in groups of three with the Aethyrs, which are said to surround
the Earth in onion-like layers.
<P>
It should be emphasized that these Parts
are not &quot;governors of the Aethyrs&quot;, as has been mistakenly
said by some writers. The name of the Part does not invoke a specific
being, but only a certain locale of the Enochian universe, with
its particular qualities. Nor does the Part in any way &quot;rule&quot;
the Aethyr of which it is a portion. One might view the relationship
between Parts and Aethyrs as being similar to the relationship
between the decanates of the zodiac and the signs of which they
are a section. The Voice of the Part is not the Part itself, but
one of the unnamed ministers who dwells therein. 
<P>
Every part is governed by one of twelve
&quot;Zodiacal Kings&quot;, who is associated with one of the
Tribes of Israel. The angels did not give Dee an explicit listing
of their zodiacal attributes; he was told to derive it from the
related tribe. Apparently he never did so. In these visions, the
following system of attributes was used, which differs from both
Agrippa system with which Dee was familiar, and the G.D. system.

<P>
The logic of this system is based on
the disposition of the Tribes depicted in Numbers 2, combined
with Dee's diagram of that disposition. There are several possible
systems that could be derived from these sources; the one actually
used was chosen by divination after the major possibilities were
assessed. In any case, it is apparent from the visions obtained
so far that the angels feel free to ignore these attributes whenever
necessary. Some of the visions are consistent with their attribute;
others show it only as a minor factor, and others yet are entirely
at odds with it.
<P>
The method of invocation was changed
during the course of the visions. In the early Parts, I deliberately
kept things as simple as possible. I would vibrate the Call of
the Aethyr two or three times, then vibrate the name of the Zodiacal
King, the Part, and the Aethyr while drawing the Part's sigil
in the air before me. I would then enter the astral world and
see whatever there was to see.
<P>
Later I decided that it would be better
to have a definite &quot;anchor&quot; for the vision on the astral
plane, in order to focus the energies. For each vision I prepared
a magickal circle on the astral, in a form resembling a talisman
for the Part. In the border of the circle, on the south side,
the name of the Zodiacal King was written. On the north side,
the name of the Aethyr. In the middle, the name of the Part, its
sigil, and the number of its resident ministers was written. All
these were oriented so that they would be upright to a person
facing south. I would vibrate the Call of the Aethyr, then go
into the astral circle to vibrate the various names. Typically,
the response to the invocation would begin with the center of
the circle becoming transparent, to reveal an aerial view of some
region of the Earth.
<P>
Following my usual practice, the visions
were recorded while they were occurring. The blank slate-blue
wall behind my computer monitor served as my &quot;scrying crystal&quot;;
I would watch events unfold in the astral space until they stopped
changing for a moment, then write down what I saw. Where the Voice
of the Part was speaking, I simply typed as it spoke. The record
that follows is exactly what was recorded at the time; it has
not been edited or changed in any way, except to correct minor
typing errors. The &quot;seer's comments&quot; that follow every
record were written immediately after the end of the vision.
<P>
Readers will note that the visions consistently
use a non-standard version of the Tree of Life, the &quot;restored&quot;
Tree devised by Frater Achad. This Tree is used simply because
it is the one on which I founded my cabalistic work; its placement
of the paths makes more sense to my astrologically-oriented mind
than does the more generally-accepted version. It should not be
construed as evidence that Achad's is the &quot;true&quot; Tree,
or that the standard version is false. Any magician exploring
these Parts will no doubt find the presentations made in terms
of his own symbol-system; it is one aspect of the angels' cooperative
nature.<p>
