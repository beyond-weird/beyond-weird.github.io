<h5>The Nature and Attributes of the Tablets</h5>

<h6>The Structure of the Great Table and the Tablets: General
Attributes</h6>

<p>
The Great Table (Plate 1) is divided into quarters, each of which
is one of the Tablets of the Elements. These Tablets in turn are
divided into quarters called &quot;Lesser Angles&quot;, each attributed
to a sub-element of the element of the Tablet. The original version
of the Great Table gave the Tablets and Lesser Angles attributes
as shown in Figure 1.
<p>
However, several years later the angel Raphael gave a revised
Great Table to Edward Kelly, in which the positions of the Tablets
within the Table were changed. Figure 2 shows the new positions.
It is important to note that while the positions of the Tablets
changed, no mention was made of a change in the elemental attributes
of the Lesser Angles.1
<p>
Here we encounter the first and most serious of the ambiguities
in the Enochian system. Dee's Enochian grimoire (written after
the revised Table were received) shows that he believed that while
the positions of the Tablets had been changed, the attributes
of the Lesser Angles did not. They remained the same as shown
in Figure 1.
<p>

<p>
Figure 1. Tablet and Lesser Angle Attributes According to Dee
<p>
It is not possible to physically rearrange the Lesser Angles in
the same manner as the Tablets. Several names and sigils for the
governors of the Aethyrs cross the boundaries between Angles.
Changing the arrangement would destroy the validity of that part
of the system. The only two options are to assume that the Lesser
Angle attributes remain the same, or to make the assumption that
their original attributes were wrong, and change them to match
the new arrangement. Dee clearly favored the first option; his
listings of the angels' powers follow the older arrangement.
<p>
When the magicians of the Golden Dawn incorporated Enochian magick
into their system, they followed the second assumption. The Lesser
Angle of Fire became the Lesser Angle of Earth; Water became Fire,
and Earth became Water. The divergent qualities of the four elements
make this a drastic change. Since every modern usage of the Tablets
stems from the Golden Dawn practice, it is possible that for over
a century magicians have been using the Tablets incorrectly.
<p>
<img src="images/fig02.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="401" HEIGHT="319">
<p>
 Figure 2. Revised Great Table (1587) with Golden Dawn Attributes
for the Lesser Angles
<p>
 Compounding the problem is the fact that no matter which set
of attributes he uses, the magician typically gets results at
least superficially in accord with the set he believes to be correct.
For instance, invoking the angel ZIZA as a power of the sub-element
of Fire in the Fire Tablet, produces fire-related imagery. Invoking
the same angel while believing him to be a power of the subelement
of Water will produce results confirming that assumption. It is
even possible for the same magician to use different attributes
for the angel in separate invocations, and get results conforming
to those he is using at the moment. As with much else in the system,
the Call being used and the intent of the magician seem to count
for more than any intrinsic nature of the angels or their offices.
<p>
 The choice of Lesser Angle attributes must then depend on considerations
outside the system itself. If the magician has already been working
with the G.D. version, or expects to work with it extensively
in the future, then it would be better to follow their attributes.
If the magician has never used their system, and never intends
to, then using the original attributes might be the better choice.
Consistency and constancy count for a great deal in making magick
effective. It is better to continue using a system that might
be wrong if you have learned to produce effective results with
it, rather than starting over with a different system having questionable
advantages. Either the original or G.D. system will work with
the Enochian Temple techniques. The G.D. attributes of the Lesser
Angles are arbitrarily used in this book, as these attributes
are probably more familiar to modern-day magicians.
<p>
 The Golden Dawn also assigned a series of attributes to each
square within the Tablets, applying a convoluted and extravagantly
ornate system of rules. Experiment suggests that they are not
a reliable reflection of the natures of the squares. When they
are used in astral visions, the results accord with the attributes
assigned; when the magician invokes angels without insisting they
show specific attributes, they typically reveal a significantly
different nature. Later in this chapter, we will consider the
problems with the G.D. system and offer an alternative system
which both conforms to the natures revealed by invocation and
avoids these problems.
<h6>Internal Structure and the Formation of Divine Names</h6>

<p>
The structure of the Tablets is clear-cut; there is no question
that each lettered square belongs to a specific part of the Enochian
hierarchy. However, there are many ambiguities concerning the
formation of divine and angelic names from those squares, and
even more questions surround their use in invocations.
<p>
 Experiment can not help to determine a &quot;true&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;
manner of usage. Enochian is a genuine magickal language; every
letter not only signifies but invokes a force. Thus every combination
of letters serves to invoke some assemblage of forces, and every
combination and variation of the divine names will produce some
result. Even &quot;names&quot; created by randomly assembling
letters will sometimes call an angel to appearance, so long as
one of the Calls is used. The desirability of the results with
a particular usage is a different question, for which only experiment
can provide an answer. Each magician should study the possible
&quot;legal&quot; variations, and try them out in a systematic
manner.
<p>
The cross that separates the Tablets in the Great Table is sometimes
called the &quot;Black Cross,&quot; due to its coloring in one
of Dee's diagrams. Fig. 3.) This cross is usually assigned to
the element of Spirit, and it serves two purposes: to bind the
Tablets together, and to provide a path of communication and transformation
between one element and the next. The names on the vertical arm
read from the edge of the Table towards the center, while the
names on the horizontal arm read from the center outwards. These
names are extracted from the Great Table and used to form a separate
tablet called the Tablet of Union. Certain letters from this cross
are used in the formation of &quot;archangelic&quot; names within
the Lesser Angles. Combinations of these names form the names
of the three regions of the Aethyr ZAX.
<p>
<img src="images/fig03.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="838" HEIGHT="502">
<p>
Figure 3. The Black Cross and Tablet of Union.
<p>
Within each Tablet a cross also separates the Lesser Angles, called
the Great Cross of the Tablet. One row and two columns of squares
form the Cross. The row is the &quot;Line of the Holy Spirit,&quot;
while the left and right columns are the &quot;Line of the Father&quot;
and the &quot;Line of the Son.&quot; (The names of the columns
do not appear to have any direct relation to the actual nature
of the Tablet.) The Great Cross contains three sets of names,
created using different methods of reading the letters. (Figure
4.) 
<p>
The God-names of three, four, and five letters are formed by reading
the Line of the Holy Spirit from left to right. Thus in the Tablet
of Earth these names are MOR DIAL HCTGA. The function of these
names is to call the power of the creator to the magician, and
to convert or filter that power into a form compatible with the
element of the Tablet. This power is very rarefied, and while
it is &quot;colored&quot; by the element of the Tablet it is not
in itself an elemental force.
<p>
Next in rank is the Elemental King of the Tablet, formed by a
spiral around the center of the Cross2. The function of the King
is to concentrate the force called by the three Names of God,
and to transfer that force downwards through all the planes represented
by the Tablets. Dee's grimoire shows two forms of the King-names,
each using only one of the two central letters of the cross. For
the Earth Tablet, these would be ICZHIHA and ICZHIHL. The angels
indicated that the first of these forms was to be used to invoke
forces used for friendly purposes, the latter for works of anger,
revenge, or punishment. Modern usage has generally been to include
both these letters in one name, e.g., ICZHIHAL.
<p>
<img src="images/fig04.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="748" HEIGHT="801">
<p>
Figure 4. Formation of Names from the Great Cross of a Tablet
<p>
  The names of the six Seniors of the Tablet are formed by reading
outward from the two central squares of the Great Cross along
each row or column. The angels said that the Seniors of the Line
of the Holy Spirit could have names of either six or seven letters,
the seven-letter version to be used &quot;when the wrath of God
is to be increased.&quot; Dee typically used both possibilities
in his invocations. Modern practice has been to use the sevenletter
versions at all times. Thus in the Earth Tablet, the names of
the Seniors are (clockwise from the top left column) ACZINOR,
LZINOPO, ALHCTGA, LIIANSA, AHMLICV, and LAIDROM.
<p>
  Within each Lesser Angle are three different ranks of names,
each again derived from a specific area. (Figure 5.)
<p>
A cross of ten squares in the center of the Lesser  Angle produces
two names having six and five letters respectively. The first
comes from reading downwards on the long arm of the cross; reading
left to right on the horizontal arm creates the second name. For
the Lesser Angle Air of Earth, the names would be ANGPOI and UNNAX.

<p>
These divine names reflect (on a lower level) the functions of
the three Names of God and the Elemental King with respect to
the Tablet as a whole. The name of six letters is said to call
forth the powers of the Lesser Angle, to create a generalized
manifestation of the powers of the sub-element. The name of five
letters commands those powers to obey the magician, concentrating
them and putting them under his control.
<p>
The four squares above the horizontal arm of the cross produce
four angelic names, called Kerubic angels or Kerubs in the Golden
Dawn system. The names are found by reading from left to right,
taking each letter in turn as the first letter of an angel's name,
and looping around to the left to complete the name. Thus in the
Lesser Angle Air of Earth, the letters BOZA produce the four Kerubs
BOZA, OZAB, ZABO, and ABOZ. A god-name or archangel rules the
Kerubic angels. Adding a letter from the Black Cross to the first
Kerub's name creates the god-name.
<p>
The proper formation of the Kerubic archangel's name is another
area of ambiguity. Dee's practice was to form the name using the
letter on the Black Cross in the same row of the Great Table as
the Kerubs in question. He used the letter &quot;e&quot; for Kerubs
in the top row of the Table, &quot;h&quot; for those in the eighth
row, &quot;a&quot; for the fifteenth, and &quot;p&quot; for the
twenty-second. This seems unreasonable, since it includes the
first and last letters of the Black Cross names for Air and Water,
and ignores the names for Fire and Earth. The Golden Dawn practice
was to use the first letter from the Black Cross name corresponding
to the element of the Kerub's Tablet. There have also been reports
of successful workings using the letter at the top of the cross
of the Lesser Angle. I believe that in this instance the G.D.
method employs the most reasonable assumptions. Using the G.D.
method, the Kerubic archangel for Air of Earth would be NBOZA.
<p>
Each line below the horizontal bar of the Lesser Angle Cross is
the name of a single angel, read from left to right ignoring the
letter on the Cross. These angels are called &quot;Servient&quot;
angels by the G.D., presumably because, unlike the Kerubs, they
are subservient to the god-names of the Lesser Angle. The G.D.
system assumes that there are actually sixteen Servient angels
in each Lesser Angle, one for each square, with their names formed
in the same manner as the Kerubs. Dee's records do not justify
this assumption. The four names for Air of Earth are AIRA, ORMN,
RSNI, and IZNR.

<h6>Using the Calls and Names in Invocations</h6>

<p>
The use of the various divine names in invocations is yet another
area of ambiguity in the Enochian system. Practically every possible
combination has been used at one time or another, and every combination
has produced some result, provided that the names were used in
conjunction with one or more of the Calls. If we examine Dee's
grimoire, we find the hierarchies listed in Table 1.
<p>

<p>

<p>

    Senior Kerubic Angel  God-name of 5 letters
<p>
      Servient Angel
<p>
but which have a direct alignment in ranking between the Enochian
powers and those of other systems.
<p>
The key to finding an alternate system is to understand the primary
blind spot of the G.D. magicians. They took the diagrammatic form
of the Tablets as being of primary importance. That is, each square
in each Tablet was a single power, and could only have a single
attribute, which was determined by the visually distinct region
of the Tablet in which the square was located. Thus every square
in the Great Cross could only have a single attribute, and the
attributes of all the Cross squares had to be related in some
way. Similarly for the Lesser Angle Crosses. This severely limited
their options, and made associations based on superficial numeric
correspondences more attractive.
<p>
We can overcome this limitation by recognizing that the power
expressed by a square does not depend on its position in the Tablet;
instead it depends on square's position in a particular divine
name. A square used in multiple names will have different attributes
depending on the name under consideration, and its hierarchical
rank. Thus where the G.D. allowed only one attribute for a Great
Cross square, we can have as many as three different attributes,
depending on whether the square is used in the Names of God, the
Elemental King, or the Seniors. And in the Lesser Angle Crosses,
the attributes of the names of six letters and of five letters
can be considered separately, instead of as a single ten-unit
structure. With this freedom, we can readily devise a system in
which the relative importance of the attribute powers is congruent
with the ranking of the names to which they are applied.
<h6>Attributes of the Three Names of God</h6>

<p>
 As was explained earlier, the Names of God invoke the power of
the creator, and transform that power into a form compatible with
the element of a particular Tablet. It has already been shown
how the full twelve names relate to the zodiac, which is the interface
between the Empyrean and the manifest world of the Tablets. Since
the three Names in a given Tablet reflect the divine power for
the ranks below them, it seems reasonable that the zodiac attributes
of the larger set should be reflected into the individual letters
of a single Tablet's Names of God.
<p>
Thus we assign each square an attribute to one of the zodiacal
signs, reflecting in miniature the divine attributes shown above
for the names taken whole. The left most square is given to Pisces,
and the rest follow the same precessional order seen earlier,
ending with Aries in the right-hand square. In this way every
element's quarter has not only the major powers of its own three
Names of God, but also a lesser but still effective sampling of
all the divine powers from the sphere of the fixed stars.
<h6>The Elemental Kings and the Seniors</h6>

<p>
The Kings and Seniors are generally believed to correspond to
the Sun and planets. However, their energies and activity do not
precisely reflect the nature of the planets in either astrology
or cabalism.
<p>
The Sun is the symbol of centrality and of self, drawing together
the functions of all levels of being, coordinating them in such
a way as to create a highly interconnected and homeostatic system.
The intense interaction produces a secondary radiance that in
turn spreads throughout the system and beyond, an &quot;aura&quot;
surrounding the whole. The Elemental King also serves a concentrating
function, but it does so only for the power of the Names of God.
It neither coordinates nor unifies the other powers within the
Tablets. In this, it has more in common with the nature of Kether,
the Primum Mobile, than it does with the cabalistic conception
of Sol or Tiphereth.
<p>
If we take the Names of God as being a circle surrounding the
manifest worlds, then the Elemental Kings occupy a position just
inside that circle, each in the center of their respective quarters.
As the powers of the Names of God move inward the Elemental King
gathers a large portion and concentrates them into a point. The
King then projects these powers (still in concentrated form) down
through all the spheres of the manifest worlds.
<p>
The King does not distribute the power in the form of general
radiance as the Sun does, but instead sends it down in an intense,
laser-like beam. The beam is a power conduit, which the lower
beings can tap into, converting the generalized power of the Names
of God into the particular powers suitable to their own levels
and position. These beings are not controlled in any way by the
Elemental King; each acts strictly according to its own office
and strictly within the realm assigned to it in the hierarchy
of the Tablets.
<p>
While correspondences between the Enochian system and the Cabala
are uncertain, the Elemental Kings appear to express something
very close to an Atziluthic or &quot;archetypal&quot; power. That
and the fiery nature of their activity would make them correspond
to the Yod of IHVH.
<p>
The angels told Dee that the Seniors give &quot;knowledge and
judgment in human affairs.&quot; This is an accurate assessment,
but needs to be expanded. The Seniors govern those levels of the
Enochian universe wherein the primary activities are those of
self-aware, self-willed beings. This covers not only mundane human
activity, but also the spiritual and magickal activities of human
initiates and several higher classes of beings. The planets are
the dominant forces in those regions, so the attribution of the
Seniors to the planets is appropriate.
<p>
The Seniors take force from the elemental King, diffuse it, and
distribute it throughout the Tablets. They act as buffers, preventing
the intense concentration of the King's power from burning up
the structures of the lower, more mundane levels. They also act
as collectors and return conduits, absorbing the excess force
radiated by the lower powers in the Tablets, channeling that force
upwards through the planes and back to the Atziluthic region.
In this buffering and distributing activity, they express a Briatic
nature, corresponding as a group to the element of Water and the
first Heh of IHVH.
<p>
Beginning with the Seniors, the Tablet hierarchy begins to drift
slightly away from the pure version of the concentric spheres
cosmology present in the Calls. The traditional concentric cosmology
gives each of the planets its own sphere, ranked as higher or
lower according to their apparent rate of motion when seen from
the Earth. Even though the Seniors correspond to the planets,
they have no rank among themselves, and the power of each covers
several planes. A similar problem occurs with the Lesser Angles,
as the powers having the same office in different Lesser Angles
are essentially equal in rank, and act on several different planes.
<p>
<img src="images/fig08.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="633" HEIGHT="480">
<p>
 Figure 8. Concentric System of Organization for the Tablet Names
<p>
A modified concentric model will still work. Figure 8 shows how
this modification would work for a single Tablet in the Great
Table. Here the Seniors and Lesser Angles cover radial sections
of  their regions, rather than each having its own ranked sphere.
As a group, the Seniors could govern several concentric levels.
<p>
Before considering the attributes of the squares we should look
at the correspondence between each Senior and a planet. This is
one instance where the Golden Dawn system appears to work well;
my practice has generally confirmed their attributes. The angels
have suggested that one minor modification would bring the G.D.
attributes fully into line with their creator's intent.
<p>
The Seniors' names radiate outwards from the center of each Tablet's
Great Cross. Starting with the upper left column and going clockwise,
the G.D. attributes them to Jupiter, Luna, Venus, Saturn, Mercury,
and Mars. The angels suggest it would be appropriate to switch
the attributes for the Seniors assigned to Mercury and Luna, placing
Mercury in the upper right column and Luna in the lower left column.
The explanation for this change is that doing so would more accurately
reflect the flow of force among the Seniors.
<p>
<img src="images/fig09.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="1214" HEIGHT="569">
<p>
   Figure 9. Power Flows Among the Seniors
<p>
A) Golden Dawn attributes  B) Modified attributes
<p>
Figure 9 shows what this means. Figure 9A shows the G.D. attributes.
If we follow the planets from point to point in their natural
order (i.e., Luna, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) the
dotted lines show where we have to &quot;jump&quot; across from
one arm to the next to continue the sequence. One of these jumps
is short while two are longer; All the jumps are towards the same
side of the cross, so the overall flow is unbalanced.
<p>
Figure 9B shows the modified attributes, and the effect the change
has on the flow. Now the jumps are all of equal length and balanced
around the circumference of the arms. Again, I have no idea whether
this change is &quot;true&quot; in any absolute sense, but I have
tested it and it seems to result in a stronger, clearer manifestation
of power for the two Seniors involved.
<p>
The Golden Dawn never developed specific attributes for the letters
of the Senior's names, relying instead on their system of decanate
attributes; nor do Dee's records provide any plan that we can
use. However, we can devise a reasonable and self-consistent system
that reflects both their equal rank and their governance of several
planetary levels.
<p>
<img src="images/fig10.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="972" HEIGHT="689">
<p>
Figure 10.3 Relation of the Seniors to the Planetary Spheres
<p>
Since the Seniors take their power from the Elemental King, we
assume that the Seniors' power moves from the outside spheres
inwards. We assign their names to the six sectors in Figure 8,
writing the letters from the outside towards the center. Drawing
circles between the letters to represent the planetary spheres,
we get a diagram as shown in Figure 10 below. The Earth Tablet
is used as an example.
<p>
Thus one letter of each Senior's name governs a particular region
of a single planetary sphere. Together, the Seniors govern an
entire sphere through the letters of their names positioned on
that level.
<p>
The ranking of the planetary spheres follows the traditional sequence
of medieval cosmology and the Cabala. And through its connection
with the planets, the Tree of Life is raised up from it's microcosmic
position in the G.D. system, and accorded a place more in keeping
with its true importance. We can validly connect each letter of
a Senior's name with one of the Sephiroth, with the letter of
Binah standing in for all three of the Supernals.
<p>
The Names of God and the Elemental King can together be considered
as expressing the power of the sphere of Chokmah. In the cabala,
Chokmah is associated with the Sphere of the Fixed Stars, the
Zodiac, and so would be an appropriate connection for the three
Names. But Chokmah is also the sphere of the Father, the &quot;expressed
will&quot; of the divine; the concentrating and activating power
of the Elemental King, with his phallic &quot;channel of power,&quot;
would fit well with this aspect of the sephira. Kether, in this
system, would not be an expressed power. As the angels told Dee,
there was one Call that they did not give him; the Call that would
invoke the power of God directly. The pure being of God is not
present, and so in terms of the Tablet hierarchy, Kether is invisible.
<p>
But as mentioned before, we should not strain too much to make
such connections absolute; the Enochian system defines its own
view of the universe, and its relation to the Tree is more suggestive
than binding. As will be seen in the following section, the connection
of the Tablets with the Tree must involve some overlap in range
between different ranks of beings.
<h5>The Lesser Angles</h5>

<p>
In the Lesser Angles we move out of the macrocosmic levels and
into the microcosm. The pattern becomes more detailed here, due
to the larger number of names involved. We see more going on because
the levels involved are those that are natural to us as human
beings; events operate on the scale we can directly comprehend.
At the same time, the scope of action of the angelic powers is
smaller than for those that came before, because the spheres involved
are smaller in volume.
<p>
Each Lesser Angle as a whole embodies the process by which material
substance, subjected to the force of the divine, is brought to
a state of perfection and purity. As such, it has two parallel
hierarchies. In one of these, spirit rules over matter but remains
separate and distinct. In the other, the spiritual and material
have been fused; the matter itself has become purified, perfected,
and transmuted into a divine expression, while still retaining
the essence of its original nature. The first of these hierarchies
contains the names on the cross of ten squares (hereafter called
the &quot;L.A. Cross&quot;) and the Servient angels. The four
Kerubic angels and their godname form the second.
<p>
Figure 11 shows the spherical positions of the names in these
two hierarchies for a single Lesser Angle. The two segments shown
are actually one segment looked at in two different ways. The
powers in the two hierarchies interpenetrate and in their combination
constitute the Lesser Angle's portion of the cosmological sphere.
Also note that each Lesser Angle reflects the same pattern seen
at the macrocosmic level. That is, two ranked Names govern the
entire region, followed by several names of equal rank in a subordinate
position. Figure 12 shows the pattern for an entire Tablet to
make this clearer. Thus this spherical conception of the Tablets
conforms to one of the prime rules of magick, &quot;That which
is below is as that which is above.&quot;

<p>
Figure 12. Spherical arrangement of an entire Tablet
<p>
In the first of the two Lesser Angle hierarchies, the L.A. Crosses
correspond to the Sun ruling over the natural worlds.  They therefore
correspond as a class to the Vav of IHVH The servient angels,
as the material on which the Crosses act, correspond as a class
to the final Heh of IHVH.
<p>
In the other hierarchy, the air and the earth have been fused
into one, and brought directly under the governance of the Spirit.
The Kerubic angels represent the Vav-Heh of IHVH, both the Yetziratic
and Assiatic worlds. This is under the &quot;vertical&quot; expression
of IHVH, its application to the planes of the Tree of Life as
a ranked hierarchy.
<p>
At the same time, the Kerubs represent a purified expression of
the four elements as they manifest within a given plane, wherein
there is no ranking between them. In this latter form, the Kerubs
are in themselves a complete representation of IHVH. The Kerubic
god-name adds a letter from the Tablet of Union. It represents
transubstantiation of the elements into a divine substance by
the addition of spirit, producing IHShVH, the Savior or Son of
God.
<p>
Both in cabalistic and astrological symbology, the Sun is the
great centralizing power, containing all other powers within itself,
both those of the planetary spheres and those of the purely elemental
spheres. It also reflects or channels the powers existing in the
macrocosm into the microcosmic or elemental spheres. The L.A.
Crosses contain both of these symbologies.
<p>
Looking at a whole Tablet, we can see a pattern of six Seniors
having planetary natures presiding over four Lesser Angles having
elemental natures. The L.A. Crosses reflect this pattern down
into each Lesser Angle, maintaining the symmetry of the system.
However, while the symbolism reflects the Seniors versus the Lesser
Angles, the functions of these names appear in practice to resemble
more those of the three Names of God and the Elemental King.
<p>
The name of six letters is said to call forth the powers of the
Lesser Angle; in practice it can be seen to produce a cloud of
generalized sub-elemental force around the magician. This is similar
to the cloud of spiritualized quasi-elemental force produced by
the Names of God. The name of five letters is said to command
the forces to obey the magician. In practice it concentrates,
focuses, and organizes the forces, causing them to take the circular
motion that magicians call a &quot;vortex&quot;. This is similar
to the whirling motion by which the Elemental King concentrates
forces at the higher level, though the name of five letters never
achieves the same degree of concentration.
<p>
The Golden Dawn attributes of the L.A. Crosses acknowledge that
they reflect the larger six-and-four pattern of the Tablets. Six
of the planets are assigned to the highest six squares of the
crosses (the planet Saturn is ignored) while the remaining four
squares have no planetary attribute. There is an additional overlay
of symbolism, assigning each of the squares to the Sephiroth.

Figure 13. Golden Dawn Attributes of the L.A. Crosses
<p>
There are problems with both these sets of attributes. The Tree
of Life connection appears based, like the decanate attributes
of the Great Cross, solely on a fortuitous coincidence of number
and an eagerness to pack as many different symbols as possible
into their system of attributes. They ignore the Enochian system's
internal evidences of structure, and the absence of any references
to the Tree in Dee's records.
<p>
The planetary attributes are more plausible, but fail for two
reasons. First, the attributes are applied across two different
divine names in such a way as to leave part of one name without
attributes. Second, the attributions do not accurately reflect
the higher level of the Tablet that is being echoed in the L.A.
Crosses. Saturn has an equal place among the Seniors, but it is
not present among the planets used in the Crosses. At the same
time they relegate the Sun to a single square, destroying the
symmetry between the two hierarchies within the Lesser Angles.
<p>
A different scheme would correct the problems with the planetary
symbology, while also preserving both the elemental aspect and
the function of  the Cross as the symbol of the Sun/Son. In this
scheme, the six letters of the vertical arm of the Cross are assigned
to the same planets as the Seniors, with the attributes the same
as in the letters of the Seniors' names. That is, we assign the
top square to Saturn, and the remaining squares take the attribute
of the other planets in order of cabalistic rank. The Sun is not
included because the entire Cross embodies his power.
<p>
The name of six letters is the power of the divine Father and
Mother, as it descends into the microcosm through the mediation
of the Son or Sun. In the explorations that discovered these attributes,
the planetary symbology of this name was overlaid with a second
consistent symbology, which is expressed in the magickal formula
AHIHVH, the merging or coalescence of the macrocosm, AHIH, and
the microcosm, IHVH. This combination of symbologies prevents
the six-letter names from being a mere duplication of the Seniors
on a lower level.  This formula, and the others relevant to the
Tablets, will be described in more detail in the next chapter.
<p>
The third member of the Father-Mother-Son is embodied in the L.A.
Cross name of five letters. With the planets all now in the six-letter
name, the squares on the horizontal arm are free to be given elemental
aspects. And the angels have combined the elemental and Father-MotherSon
symbologies by giving this name the power of the True Son, in
medieval belief: IHShVH, Yeheshua, the Savior. The letters of
this name are attributed, from left to right, to Fire, Water,
Spirit, Air, and Earth.
<p>

Figure 14. New attributes of the L.A. Cross names.
<p>
In my dealings with them, the angels have never insisted on using
a Christian symbology. Indeed, they have sometimes shown contempt
for the human churches and their doctrines, thinking them silly
or unrealistic. But in the present instance they have been adamant
on the connection between this name and the symbolism of the Son
as Savior. What is being &quot;saved&quot;, they say, is matter
itself.
<p>
The universe, they say, is full of &quot;dark&quot; matter; that
is, matter which has not yet been incorporated into the activity
of a creator and is thus &quot;unredeemed&quot;. The function
of this name is to take the divine impulse, represented by the
name of six letters, and apply it to unredeemed matter. The matter
is thereby brought into a state of activity above its normal state
of total quiescence and negativity, is &quot;raised up&quot; to
a level where it can come under the activity of the so-called
Servient angels. In the process, the matter is formed into elementals,
the most basic form of magickal being.
<p>
The Servient angels act on these elementals, train them and condition
them to conform their activity to the impulse of a divine creative
power. Their initial chaotic forms are made regular, conforming
to their primary natures. The elementals then take their place
in the normal creative activity taking place on this planet. Through
this process they are eventually brought to a state of relative
perfection, where they come under the rulership of the Kerubic
angels.
<p>
The attributes of the Servient angels combine those of the five-letter
Name of God with those of the Kerubic angels, so we should next
consider the Kerubs.
<p>
The Kerubs express a quality of purity and fixity. Their expression
remains the same, no matter the plane or kingdom in which they
are acting. Experiencing their energy in invocations, I get the
sense that they have gone through an alchemical process of purification,
so that only the essence or perfect metal remains out of the mass
of substance from which they came. They are so pure in nature
that nothing can touch or change them. Like natural law, they
are the essence of all things manifest; like natural law, the
constant change of the manifest world touches them not at all.
They ever remain themselves. 
<p>
The Kerubs have a significantly larger range of action than the
Servient angels. They touch every level of the microcosm. In some
ways they go even higher than the powers of the L.A. Crosses,
effectively bypassing the solar influence and dealing directly
with God. The power that rules them takes its divine element from
the Tablet of Union, completely outside the spherical system represented
by the rest of the Tablet. This means that the entire macrocosmic
expression of the Tablets is bypassed as well. This is a parallel
with the way in which the Second Call, which creates the &quot;structure&quot;
or substance aspect, is out of the sequence shown in the other
Calls, which create the things that fill and elaborate that structure.
<p>
The implication of this separation of the Kerubs is that the creation
of matter was separate from the creation and development of the
world itself. As was mentioned in discussing the Calls, a modern
version of the medieval cosmology requires that we view our sphere
of creation  as being only one of many such spheres within the
universe. Each of these spheres has its own themes, its own different
style of creativity being worked out. Each has its own &quot;prime
creator&quot;, who defines the themes being worked out within
his sphere of influence. 4
<p>
By the principles of physics, matter must express the same characteristics
and behavior everywhere in the universe without exception. We
must therefor consider that matter was made prior to the creation
of the various spherical regions, and made in such a way that
it could be used for a huge variety of different creative themes.
The &quot;first creator&quot;, who made the substance that all
subsequent creators have used in their works, embodied certain
specific but highly flexible principles in that substance. The
Kerubs in turn embody those principles as they work out in the
sixteen subelements of the Tablets.
<p>
Here again we encounter a quasi-Christian symbolism, for the magickal
formula expressed by the Kerubic angels is INRI. Christian myth
says that these letters represent the sentence &quot;Jesus of
Nazareth, King of the Jews&quot;, but here they are used instead
as a representation of the dynamic process of creation as it is
embodied in the four elements. This symbolism will be covered
in detail in the following chapters. Here it is sufficient to
say that the letters correspond (from left to right) to the elements
of Air, Water, Fire, and Earth.
<p>
The so-called &quot;Servient&quot; angels govern the elements
as they manifest in the natural world; they represent the movements,
changes, and transformations of state that make up the activity
behind all four kingdoms in nature. Each Lesser Angle appears
to have a close relation with one of these kingdoms; Air to Humans
(considered as natural, not spiritual beings), Water to the Plants,
Earth to the Mineral kingdom, and Fire to the Animal. This relationship
remains the same in all the Tablets; each Tablet, in its own way,
touches all the kingdoms, and governs portions of the activities
therein. A high degree of redundancy is also present; squares
in different Tablets seem to touch on the same activities, but
view them from slightly different perspectives.
<p>
These angels express perfectly the astrological concept of mutability;
their apparent expressions undergo constant change as their energy
passes from place to place. In no place are they ever the same
as any other, yet behind their changing expression there is a
constancy of principle at work. It would be futile to try to list
any significant portion of their functions; explorations will
reveal that they cover a vast range of events within the world.
<p>
In addition these angels function as teachers or trainers for
the elemental beings raised up through the power of the Names
of God in the L.A. Cross. The quality they attempt to instill
in the elementals is responsiveness or active intelligence, the
ability to react quickly and perfectly to an outside impulse.
The matter out of which the elementals were raised was, in its
normal state, completely inert and unresponsive; learning to react
constitutes a significant change of nature for them. The angels
perform their training by directing the elementals in the action
of natural processes, and activities done under the direction
of magicians.
<p>
Each letter of each Servient angel's name embodies dual elemental
attributes. One of these attributes derives from the Kerubic angels,
and is therefor governed by the INRI formula; the other derives
from the &quot;saving force&quot; of the five-letter Name of God,
and is governed by YHShVh. Thus as a group they &quot;save&quot;
or &quot;redeem&quot; the matter with which they work, through
the application of universal dynamic laws.
<p>
The INRI attribute of a given square is determined by reference
to the Kerubic letter at the top of the column. Thus a square
in the first column on the left is attributed to Air of INRI,
the next to Water of INRI, and so on.
<p>
The influence of YHShVH is represented in the attributes given
to the rows of letters; thus each Servient angel works out a single
&quot;letter&quot; of the process of salvation. The spiritual
influence of the letter Shin is not used in their attributes,
but only the four letters of the &quot;normal&quot; elements.
The Spirit can be considered as invisibly present throughout their
activities.
<p>
But unlike the usual use of IHVH, in the Servient angels the attributes
are applied from the lowest row upwards. This is because the unredeemed
matter on which they work is symbolically &quot;below&quot; them,
and has to pass through the four elemental stages in order. Thus
the lowest row corresponds to Fire, the next to Water, the third
to Air, and the highest row to Earth.
<h5>Creating Pyramids Using the Revised Attributes5</h5>

<p>
The Golden Dawn devised a technique for using visualizations of
truncated pyramids for starting off visions of individual squares
from the Tablets. Unlike their system of attributes, this practical
method has been proven by use to be very effective, and works
just as well with the attributes given here. The Temples of the
tablets use an elaboration of the technique, and practice with
the simple pyramids is a good precursor to that work, described
later in this book.
<p>
The basic technique is to build a hollow truncated pyramid in
the imagination. The flat top has an area one ninth the area of
its base. The relative sizes of the top and bottom means the sides
are tilted inwards at an angle of forty-five degrees.
<p>
The magician visualizes the letter of the square on the flat top,
in either English or Enochian characters. Color each side of the
pyramid  in a color related to an attribute of the square. Then
various sigils, symbols, and images are visualized on the sides.
<p>
The pyramid is visualized as being large enough to stand on the
top. Having vibrated the appropriate Calls for the name in which
the square lies, the magician then visualizes himself standing
on top of the pyramid in his astral body, and vibrates the hierarchy
of names. As he vibrates each name, the magician imagines the
power of that name gathering around the pyramid.
<p>
When the last name is vibrated, the magician imagines that each
side of the pyramid is gathering in the attracted energy, each
taking the type appropriate to its attributes and symbols. This
energy is seen moving upwards, being focused as it goes by the
narrowing of the sides. The flows of energy from the sides reach
the top simultaneously, run into each other, and form a beam of
light shining up into the astral worlds. The magician then follows
this beam in his astral body until a landscape or other scene
forms around him. This scene should symbolize various aspects
of the square invoked. The usual techniques of astral visions
are used from that point.
<p>
I prefer a variation of this method, in which the magician stands
inside the pyramid. When the energies traveling up the sides reach
the top, they come together on the letter and then shine downwards
into the pyramid, illuminating the interior. The angel governing
the square is invoked to visible appearance within the pyramid
and is tested there. After testing, the angel conducts the magician
to various scenes that illustrate the square's nature.
<p>
Table 3 shows a complete listing of the attributes for pyramids
using the system presented here. For quick reference, the colors
associated with various attributes are shown in Table 4. Note
that the colors for the planets follow their path attributes rather
than their connections with the Sephiroth of the Tree of Life.

</pre>

<p>
The symbols on the sides of the pyramid serve primarily to remind
the unconscious part of the magician's mind of the attributes
being used, and to stimulate it to produce stronger and more far-reaching
connections to the magickal universe. These symbols may be as
simple or elaborate as the practitioner wants to make them. The
following suggestions are not rigid; vary them as seems appropriate
from your experience.
<p>
The area of elemental attributes has the greatest potential for
confusion, so making a clear distinction between the various sources
of attributes is important. For the element of a Tablet or Lesser
Angle, use the Enochian sigil of the element, or the Wheel for
Spirit. For a side representing a IHVH or IHShVH attribute, use
the Hebrew letter. And for INRI attributes, use the corresponding
fixed sign of the zodiac, to which the formula is closely related.
<p>
Among the letters with planetary attributes, such distinctions
do not appear to be as important; using the standard glyphs of
the planets works well enough. As an alternative, you can distinguish
by using the standard glyphs alone for a &quot;pure&quot; planetary
attribute, as in the Elemental King. Combine them with the magickal
image of the corresponding sephiroth for pyramid sides representing
the &quot;sphere&quot; attribute of a letter in a Senior's name,
and with the appropriate letter of AHIHVH for the six-letter Names
of God.
