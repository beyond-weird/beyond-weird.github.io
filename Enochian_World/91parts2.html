Zirzird, Part 18 of 91, 3rd of MAZ.
Zodiacal King: Gebabal Ministers: 7220 Mundane association: Parthia
<p>
Monday, November 14, 1994  2:25 PM
<p>
Invoked Zirzird following the revised
method.
<p>
As I vibrated the name of the Part,
after the Call, a conical formation rose up out of the center
of the circle, its lower part contiguous with the bounds of the
inner circle. It was a tall narrow cone, of about my own height.
It seemed to transform for a moment into a snow-covered mountain,
upon which goats leapt upwards in great arcs. Then it was simply
a whitish cone again.
<p>
The scene changes once more, and now
there comes the escapee from the castle of the previous vision.
No longer naked, he seems to have caught some of the goats and
made rough clothes out of their skins. Far away behind him the
castle can be seen, blank side facing me. (It seems we are on
a height.) And the road into the wasteland comes in this direction
before vanishing from sight below a ridge. 
<p>
The man trudges along an upward trail.
He carries a staff in one hand, and has a pack made of tough,
woven grasses on his shoulders. He reminds me of the ancient man
whose body was recently found frozen in a Swiss glacier. 
<p>
(It is odd, but I feel the presence
of the Devil of the Tarot card behind this vision.)
<p>
Now I see him from behind, looking up
the mountain. The top is hidden in clouds; he is approaching the
snowline just below the clouds. He attempts to follow the trail
into the snow, but his feet begin slipping; he can make no progress.
By straining mightily, he manages to get a few feet further, but
the farther he goes, the more difficult it becomes. It seems that
gravity is increasing, pulling him backwards. 
<p>
Finally he is exhausted, and he slides
back. Tumbling, he passes the snowline and rolls a ways down the
trail before stopping and sitting up. A bit of snow follows and
swirls around him, as if teasing him, and then falls to the ground.
<p>
He repeats his attempt two or three
times, sliding backwards at the end each time.
<p>
Now a ghostly overlay comes on the scene.
Hidden in the clouds, the tarot Devil sits upon the top of the
mountain, which does not end in a point, but in a wide, flat area
exactly at the level where the clouds begin. The mountain itself
is the black cube of the tarot card, and the gravity is the chain
that ties the male and female figures to the cube. The climber
is one of those figures, though he does not know it.
<p>
The Voice says: &quot;Men are tormented
by the Great Illusion; the illusion that there is some pinnacle
of achievement to be reached through striving against the pull
of Earth. Thus they push ever upwards, seeking a topmost point
that does not exist. 
<p>
&quot;As the Sun seems to climb to the
peak of the sky, and rule over the day therefrom, so do men, looking
upwards in the Spirit, see what appears to be a great spiritual
Sun above them, ruling over the worlds in which they live and
move. And so they climb towards it, seeking to partake of its
nature.
<p>
&quot;But it is not inherent in the
heavens that there be such a pinnacle. The peaks of mountains
are the result of gravity, of the pull of the Earth; and where
that pull is not, neither is there any top to be reached. All
spreads out in all directions; one place is not inherently &quot;higher&quot;
than another. The categorizations of the Earth-bound existence
collapse in the face of new conditions.
<p>
&quot;That Sun, which seemed so high
and so great, is, from that wider vantage (i.e. outside the Earth's
influence) to be nothing more than a single point of light in
an immensity so great as to be beyond any comprehension. 
<p>
&quot;The very act of striving against
the Earth affirms that one is bound to the Earth; rather, give
up that upon which the pull of Earth acts, abandon it to become
one with the Earth. And then, that which remains may fly outwards.&quot;
<p>
I waited for a while, but nothing more
seemed to come. I thus closed the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
This vision continues the previous one,
and borrows from it to keep the symbolism compact. The mountain
here is the same one seen in the distance there. The mundane region
connected with this Part, Parthia, doesn't seem to have any direct
connection with what is seen.
<p>
The previous vision was connected with
Cyprus, and this mountain is the Mount Olympus on that island.
Since that &quot;Olympus&quot; is not the original, it is not
the home of the gods, but instead a false image of that place,
a suitable home for the Father of Lies. 
<p>
The tarot card The Devil is associated
with the zodiac sign of Capricorn, and connects Binah with Tiphereth
in Achad's Tree of Life. The sign governs all struggles upwards
against resistance, whether that be a physical struggle to climb
a mountain, or a struggle upwards in the hierarchy of some organization.
By association it rules all organizations with pyramidal structure.

<p>
I believe that this Part is in some
sense the complement of the Part named Tiarpax, seen previously.
There it was shown how the finite self, by emulating its &quot;true
father&quot; in the act of undiscriminating love, becomes one
with the divine. The process shown was one of attraction through
similarity. Here we look at the complementary process, which is
one of &quot;pushing away&quot; that which is below, in order
to rise higher.
<p>
Either one can serve as a means of spiritual
advancement. The problem is that, unlike Chokmah, Binah has no
discernible characteristics, no innate tendencies of its own.
It is the negation or cessation of all possible manifest characteristics
and tendencies. Thus any perceived goal the person has in his
struggle upwards is necessarily a projection of his own nature,
or the generalized nature of the Ruach, represented by its center
in Tiphereth. It is an illusion that conceals the true goal. 
<p>
As long as one pursues such a projected
goal, one is blind to the real goal. And simply pushing away from
the finite aspects of being cannot get one into Binah. Rejection
creates a bond with the thing being rejected; even as one pushes
it away, one becomes more tied to it. Trying to reach Binah solely
in this manner is like trying to touch the Moon by standing on
a hill and jumping at it. <br>

<p>
<a NAME="Opmacas"><img src="images/img13370.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="158"></a>
<p>
Opmacas, Part 19 of 91, 1st of DEO.
Zodiacal King: Zarnaah  Ministers: 6363 Mundane association: Getulia
(Western Sahara, south of Morocco)
<p>
Saturday, November 26, 1994  3:14 PM
<p>
Invoked Opmacas following the revised
method. 
<p>
There came into my sight an image of
the glyph of Libra. This glyph became three-dimensional, and took
on the color of brass or bronze. At the pivot point was a point
of searing white light, on which the arms rested. My viewpoint
approached the balance, then took a quick left turn, moving out
along one arm of the balance. At the end of the arm, an ornate
hanging hook was attached to the arm by a cross piece; I realized
the hook and crosspiece were the glyph of Saturn.
<p>
At the end of the other arm of the balance,
a glyph of Jupiter was attached, hanging from curled-over end
of the glyph's curved member. It curled around the arm and had
it's weight so distributed that the vertical cross piece of the
glyph was balanced directly below the arm. 
<p>
But it seemed that this vertical piece
was formed like a wavy-bladed knife (a kris?) with the point upwards,
made out of some white metal, possibly tin. Instead of a hilt
and handle at the lower end of the blade, there was a sphere of
the same metal, with a surface sand-blasted into a grayish finish.
(The whole looks like a single sperm cell; it also reminded me
of Chokmah. As I thought this, I received confirmation of it.)
<p>
Now back at the other end of the balance,
I saw that the lower end of the Saturn glyph was curled over into
a small hook. Attached to this hook were four braided ropes. These
descended and surrounded a much larger black ball. There was a
sense of tremendous weight to this ball, though it was balanced
by the gray sphere, which gave no such sense.
<p>
This ball had an insubstantial outer
layer, into which the ropes sank slightly. Next came a tough integument
of some sort, covering a jelly-like filling that took up most
of the volume. Inside the filling the world floated, seeming at
once to be whole, and to be decomposed into its myriad parts,
down to the tiniest atom. 
<p>
The Voice said, &quot;What is the divine
creative will without that upon which to expend itself? And what
is the substance of being without that which fertilizes it and
causes new things to arise from its infinite potential? Neither
is whole without the other. 
<p>
&quot;With this Part, we transfer fully
from the male side of the Tree to the female side. Though some
earlier parts contained powers from this side, this was because
they were necessary to maintain a balanced relationship in the
activity of the male paths, or in the action of the neutral path
of the central pillar. For example, the Parts of Capricorn, Fire,
and Sol are so closely connected at their base that their powers
interact and influence each other perpetually. To take one away
from the other would be to disturb that balance.
<p>
(A pause.)
<p>
&quot;As the winds shift in the fall,
and the light becomes the dark of the year, so here does the balance
of the Parts shift. And so is Libra the sign of this change. But
the rulers of Libra are both feminine, so the shift is weighted
towards the dark and does not return to the light until the weight
of the male side is enhanced in the power of Aries.
<p>
&quot;Love and Structure, acceptance
and support; these are the powers of the feminine side of the
tree, as they are the essential powers of the female human. And
nourishment of growth; for is not the arc of Luna concealed within
the sign of Saturn? And it is the waxing Moon, spilling its newly
regenerated power into the world.
<p>
&quot;And yet, one might object, further
down this side are the powers all male. Why is this so, if the
left-hand pillar is the side of the feminine? 
<p>
&quot;For this cause: that the power
of Capricorn is the Mountain, the Mons, the ultimate solidity
of the feminine principle of Structure. The male power of Mars
climbs its heights, but without the mountain, its power would
be expended uselessly. And so also for the Path of Mars; for the
Tower is a thing of rock, of stone, and these are Saturn. The
soldier conceals himself within the tower for defense, hiding
in the Mother; so also he attacks the tower, seeking to penetrate
the Lover. In both instances his actions would be futile without
her; for aggression and thrust cannot exist without that against
which to direct its energies. And spiritually this is rightly
the feminine, where among the debased power is pitted against
power in uncreative activity.
<p>
&quot;And in yet another sense, the
tower is not a phallus at all; but Caer Benoic or Carbonek, the
castle that shelters the Grail. 
<p>
&quot;And so on down the Tree. In Virgo
is the feminine power brought even further down; and we shall
see Scorpio again, as it relates to this side of the Tree. Much
more is to be given, never fear.
<p>
&quot;For now, we are done.&quot;
<p>
I thanked the Voice, and asked if I
should invoke this Part again. The indication was that I should
not, but should instead continue on.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
As all the Parts are representative
of a dynamic change of state, so here also. The form of change
is the simple and well-understood shifting of the balance. The
Zodiacal King Zarnaah, who rules this Part, is connected with
Libra in the system of correspondences used for this work. Note
that 19, the Part's number, is the mirror-image of 91, the total
number of parts.
<p>
The balance here is viewed as between
the divine masculine expression and the divine feminine, and introduces
a new sequence of Parts descending from Kether primarily through
the Pillar of Severity, where those previous were in the Pillars
of Mildness and Mercy. But here the two aspects seem to be in
equilibrium and very tightly bound to one another.
<p>
Bronze is a combination of a &quot;female&quot;
metal, copper, with a &quot;male&quot; metal, tin; thus the balances
seen in the image are a merger of the two aspects. Jupiter and
Saturn are the paths that descend from Kether (the pivot of the
balance) to Chokmah and Binah respectively in Achad's Tree of
Life, and are themselves traditionally considered a complementary
male and female pair. This becomes even more explicit in the representations
of the &quot;weights&quot; on the ends of the balance as a sperm
and ovum, and as the sephiroth generally labeled as the Father
and Mother within the Tree of Life.
<p>
There follows a somewhat revisionist
interpretation of the paths of Capricorn and Mars. These are traditionally
&quot;male&quot; in nature, but the viewpoint emphasizes the necessity
for the presence of an opposite, &quot;female&quot; aspect of
existence before these powers can be used with effect. Mountains
have often been seen as feminine in nature; association with the
breasts and the Mons Veneris are common. The Goat is nothing without
the mountain on which to climb.
<p>
The Tower of Mars is viewed here not
as the phallus, the embodiment of the male principle, but rather
as the object of that principle's efforts. The inside of the tower
is emphasized, its nature as an enclosure, and thus it is transformed
into a symbol of the kteis, the vagina and womb. Thus the male
power can be protected inside it, like a child in the womb, while
another male power seeks to penetrate it and place itself inside.

<p>
<a NAME="Genadol"><img src="images/img27307.gif" WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="255"></a>
<p>
Genadol, Part 20 of 91, 2nd of DEO.
Zodiacal King: Hononol (Taurus)  Ministers: 7706  Mundane association:
Arabia (Arabian Peninsula, except the Red Sea coast and Yemen.)
<p>
Monday, December 19, 1994 12:03 AM
<p>
Invoked Genadol according to the revised
procedure.
<p>
A curtain split before me, and behind
it was the glyph of Taurus, in gold on a black background. The
black was abysmally deep; nothing of light could be seen in it.
<p>
Now the glyph split into two parts,
the crescent becoming the moon in the night sky, the circle becoming
a gold coin; the latter fell to earth, spinning through the air.
(The coin has a simple, equal-armed cross embossed upon it.) White
tears seemed to leak from the lower arm of the moon, or to condense
upon it. Each one swelled and fell off, changing in midair to
another coin. The air was quickly filled with coins and other
things of great value, all condensing from an invisible menstruum
around the moon. 
<p>
The darkness is very pleasant, and seems
infinite in extent.
<p>
&quot;This is she of whom it is said,
she brings forth all things, but is never empty; she holds all
things in herself, but is never full. Out of her comes the world
in all its glory, indeed, all worlds are within her at all times.
The Father's seed concentrates her substance, but can never exhaust
it.&quot;
<p>
(I don't know whether the above paragraph
was my own thought, or another's.)
<p>
Now all the things falling through the
air finally hit the Earth, and are absorbed into it; they disappear
from sight, but the sense of their value, of riches and wealth,
remains. The Earth itself becomes those riches.
<p>
My sight draws nearer to the Earth,
and it seems that I am above the southern part of the Arabian
peninsula, close to its southeast corner. And I see below a caravan,
bringing frankincense and spices north-westwards across the desert.
Camels and asses are loaded high; richly-woven carpets pad them,
other carpets cover the loads. Sounds of jingling bells and sweet
music follow them. 
<p>
A thought comes to me: the sun is the
destroyer in this land, the moon the succorer. For the heat of
the day wears down all things, burning the life from them. But
under the moon men can work or travel in comfort. And deeper in
time, this was the land of the goddess, as were the lands to the
north; her hidden influence still lingers, sustaining the faith
of those who now direct that faith to another god. (Something
here also about the lunar crescent being the symbol of all these
lands even today.) 
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
This Part is the first attributed to
Taurus among the 91. Taurus is ruled by Venus and has Luna exalted;
thus it is, in a sense, the ultimate &quot;feminine&quot; sign.
This seems appropriate for the first Part to follow the &quot;shifting
of the balance&quot; described in the previous Part.
<p>
The black background is Binah, the infinite,
transcendental no-thing from which any thing finite is produced.
The horns of the Taurus glyph become the Moon as image or mask
of Binah, the &quot;bright, fertile Mother&quot;, AIMA. Stimulated
by the Father she produces a liquid essence from which anything
may be (and is) made. The fruits of the Mother then fall into
the Earth and become one with it, so that the Daughter partakes
of her Mother's nature.
<p>
Material wealth in general is attributed
to Taurus, as is trade in goods. The camels of the caravan are
Lunar by connection with the planet's Hebrew letter. The form
of frankincense reflects the drops falling from Luna in the previous
image, as does the means by which it is produced. 
<p>
July 9, 1995  1:20 p.m.
<p>
Invoked Genadol according to the usual
procedure. The sigil of the Part (upon which I was standing) fell
away beneath me, and merged into the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia.
My body expanded until it seemed that my feet were in Arabia,
and my body stood extending far above the Earth. I could not see
my body, but only feel it. 
<p>
Once again I heard the voice, saying
faintly &quot;This is She from whom all things come, yet She is
not empty; this is She who holds all things in Herself, yet is
not full; this is She who showers upon the Earth her everlasting
life and wealth. She has taken the Father's seed and made it one
with the Earth her daughter.&quot; Essentially the same as in
December's vision; only small changes in wording, no change in
meaning. The voice reduced to a faint chanting in the background,
from which no more words could be distinguished.
<p>
Now another voice comes and says: &quot;Where
Eden was, now stands a desert. For the evil of man has eaten up
Her life here, and taken all the wealth therefrom, and carried
it away unto distant lands. There is naught left but the bones
of the world here. Yet even the marrow of those bones is being
taken; and soon shall naught be left of her glory save dry dust
and stone, unto the center of the Earth.
<p>
&quot;Yet in another place is Eden still
as it was; naught is lost to the world. Memory fades, yet in the
essence of things is the past preserved. She holds it in Herself,
and shall bring it forth again in those days when men desire to
restore the world. As a vision shall it come to them in those
days, and through their knowledge and will shall it be made manifest
again.
<p>
&quot;Now looks upwards, o man, unto
the places from which you came.&quot;
<p>
I looked towards the stars, and the
pull of Earth beneath me faded. And it seemed that all the stars
there are were compressed within a ring of glowing golden color,
surrounded by that ring. The glow extended inwards, enclosing
the stars from above and below in a lenticular shape. Knowledge
came that the lens is a mystery of Her, for from above or below
it shows the circle of enclosure; while from any side view it
is the Vesica Piscis, the gate from which things are born. Thus
the lens comprises both the womb and vagina, but in a manner different
from the glyph of Venus; for since the lens is both womb and gate,
things are born from Her yet they remain perpetually enclosed
within Her.
<p>
I contemplated this lens for a while
in silence. Then a great beam of light appeared and passed through
the lens, being focused to a point by it. And I knew that this
beam was a male power of some sort. The voice said:
<p>
&quot;Within the Earth is the Mother
complemented by the Father; she brings forth that which His creative
will signifies. And so it is in the greater world as well; the
entire universe is a vehicle by which a greater Father works his
creative will. What that will is, none knows; for that Father
is incomprehensible even to the highest gods. How much more lacking
is our own understanding? We know that it is so, but little else.
<p>
&quot;And here is the ultimate mystery:
that there is one Mother, but many Fathers. For the Mother who
acts within the Earth is the same who holds the universe in her
womb. There is no division in her. But the sources of creation
are not one; many creative beings act upon her to bring forth
their creations; each such being is a Father, and works his will
alone and separate from the rest. The men of Earth (comprising
also the women of Earth) work their wills upon her, and bring
forth new things within the world. The gods work their wills upon
her and bring forth stars, and planets, and those greater structures
that are invisible to men. 
<p>
&quot;Each works their own will, but
despite this, there seems to be a unity, a coordination among
their creations. Some of this is because the lesser creators act
within a field that greater creators have already shaped somewhat;
thus within any given world it seems that there is one Plan shaping
everything. But the greater and more comprehensive unity comes
from the fact that all are dealing with the substance of the same
Mother, bringing forth their creations out of Her, so that all
of their creations are Her children and show family resemblances
to each other. 
<p>
&quot;Contemplate the Mother, o man,
and know Her. Much that comes after in this series is dependent
upon Her, and comes directly from Her womb into the world.&quot;
<p>
I did so for some time.
<p>
&quot;We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments: 
<p>
The principles of male-vs.-female in
these visions seems to have many echoes with Liber AL. Nuit is
&quot;continuous&quot; as the Mother here has &quot;no division
in her.&quot; Hadit can be many places, is multiple, just as in
the early visions of this series we saw the male force in the
form of countless sparks of divine creative fire. The union between
the continuity of the former and the diversity of the latter is
the ever-changing, ever-renewing world of events, depicted as
the 91 Parts themselves in these visions, and as Ra-Hoor-Khuit
in Thelema.
<p>
I wonder at the paucity of ideas relating
to Nuit in Thelemic doctrine. There are a few practical works
related to her -- the Gnostic Mass, Liber NV. Liber NV seems too
glib and hacked-together to me; it shows little real understanding.
Explications of her nature and its philosophical consequences
are non-existent in A.C.'s works; even in <i>The Vision and The
Voice</i> she is hardly visible. I suppose the prophet of the
Brat-God had too little sympathy with her to do the job right.

Aspi<a NAME="Aspiaon">aon, Part 21 of
91. 3rd of DEO. Zodiacal King: Zinggen. Ministers: 6320. Mundane
association: Phalagon (a region unknown to Dee. Possibly Faliscan,
an area of southern Etruria.)</a>
<p>
July 12, 1995  3:45 PM
<p>
The vision opened with a brief image
of torrential rain, gone almost before it was seen. Then it seemed
as if I were in a region of deep, still, clear water, but colored
purple or mauve of the shade sometimes seen in the body's internal
organs. [7/13/95 -- The color of the inside of the womb during
a woman's fertile days of the month, when it is engorged with
blood.]
<p>
Within this water -- if water it is
-- there floated many small pearl-like spheres, distributed thinly
throughout the volume I could see. 
<p>
The voice said: &quot;Each of these
'pearls' is a world; no, not a single planet necessarily, but
a region wherein a single creative theme is being manifested.
It might, in time and space, be a planet, or a sun, or a person
or some other thing. But here within the womb of the Mother, in
the amnion of her body, are these creations the simple things
you see. They are precipitated out of her undivided fluid by the
stimulus of the Father's seed; each seed is at the core of one
of the pearls you see, and she builds upon it those things necessary
for it to become manifest.&quot;
<p>
Another brief image here. I moved toward
one of the pearls and passed into it. Passing the boundary, an
unending variety of things exploded outwards around me. Everything
was in a tremendous state of activity, things changing into other
things, new things constantly arising, old things disappearing
and re-appearing in a modified form. I couldn't grasp but a small
portion of what was going on. Then I was as suddenly back where
I began, and all that activity was shut off as if it had never
been. All this took place within a second, but seemed longer in
terms of experience.
<p>
&quot;That which is inside them, which
is their nature, is of no importance here. For she transcends
all such creations in herself. She is not affected by them, nor
is she in any way active within them. (Though she is present therein
at all times, yet she does not act or move.) [That is, the particular
theme being expressed inside a &quot;pearl&quot; is a wholly internal
matter, and is irrelevant to the realm which contains it. Anything
that expresses a specific nature is not Her.]
<p>
&quot;They see her not, who are within
such a pearl; they know her not, nor can they come to her without
abandoning that which they are. For she is free of all conditions,
all distinctions, all differentiations and limits; she is the
'none' that encloses their &quot;sum&quot;. [I heard &quot;sum&quot;
as a three-way cabalistic pun, meaning &quot;sum&quot; in the
sense of &quot;totality&quot;, &quot;some&quot; in the sense of
quantified thing-ness, and the Latin &quot;sum&quot; or &quot;I
am&quot;.]
<p>
&quot;She is Nought, yet All cannot
contain her; the smallest portion of her would overflow it. (And
this word 'portion' is a lie even to speak in her presence.)
<p>
&quot;Go you to her, o man, and become
her servant. She it is that is your true core of being, the unchanging,
end- and beginning-less [a word not comprehended here] of you.
Not Set, for he is her Servant as you are, and made you out of
her at her direction. Not any god is at the core of your being;
there is no core, only endlessness.&quot;
<p>
(I don't know whether this statement
is specific to myself, or a general statement of man's condition.
The unspoken subtext seems to say the former; The god Set is my
&quot;father&quot;, but in some circular fashion his creation
was the will of the Mother, according to terms she somehow specified.
How an undifferentiated, non-acting whatever-she-is could do this
is beyond my understanding.)
<p>
&quot;We are done for the moment. Come
again to this place before going on.&quot;
<p>
Friday, July 14, 1995  1:33 PM
<p>
Once again I get a brief glimpse of
torrential rains, then the image changes to a mountainous seacoast,
possibly a peninsula jutting out into the sea -- I cannot tell
from my viewpoint, which is out over the sea. (near Sorrento,
south of Naples?) Three sharp-peaked mountains are the peaks of
the Part's sigil. 
<p>
Now my viewpoint sinks into the sea,
first through brightly-lit water full of colorful fishes, then
through darker, blue-violet water. Finally into a region where
the water is dark, not with the absence of light, but because
its color is ultraviolet, beyond my sight. 
<p>
Strange shapes form and dissolve, hardly
seen in the moments they exist. One seems to be a wire-like outline
of a cube, but with a hole in the middle. (That is, a spherical
region of absence is suspended in the center of the cubical frame.)
<p>
Another looks like a dog with three
heads, each one pointed to a different point of an equilateral
triangle. Or is it a trefoil brass candle-holder? I cannot tell.

<p>
A Russian icon of Jesus, complete with
gold-leaf halo, comes and goes again. His left hand is held down
and palm-forward, with the thumb and first two fingers spread
and the other two fingers folded against the palm. The right shows
the same gesture, but with the hand raised to breast-height and
the fingers pointing upwards. The icon tilts backwards until only
its edge is visible, and then floats upwards out of sight. I do
not know what this means.
<p>
The voice says: &quot;That which is
the source of creation is also a source of destruction. For are
not the waters below as they are above? [That is, the Mother surrounds
all creations, so she is as much &quot;below&quot; them as she
is &quot;above&quot; them in their internal coordinate system,
even though that system is meaningless in her own context.]
<p>
&quot;She is the power that burns in
the depths of being, that churns up the detritus of ancient days
and brings it forth into the light. She is the acid that eats
at the roots of being, and hell is in her as much as is heaven.
If one sinks into those depths, then one encounters her in a seemingly
evil aspect, as she destroys him. She is the ending-place of the
Black Brothers as she is of the White, though they know it not
and would deny it if they could.
<p>
&quot;We say these things not to scare,
but simply as fact. She is there; her being surrounds all. In
either direction one comes to her, at the ends of creation.&quot;

<p>
I felt myself continuing to sink into
the water, and the forms ceased to appear. Momentarily there was
a sense of many disconnected particles flashing about. Then it
felt as if I had passed through some sort of membrane and had
fallen out of  some enclosed region into a larger one. The flashing
particles became stars filling the sky below me, while above was
a great sphere of a dark purplish-silver color. And now I wasn't
falling &quot;down&quot;, but &quot;away&quot; from that sphere.
<p>
And as I moved away, I saw that what
I thought were stars were actually galaxies. I could sense all
the individual stars that composed each one, and all the living
planets that circled those stars. And on one of those planets
was the mountainous peninsula I saw at the start of the vision.
<p>
&quot;The end is the beginning. There
is, in truth, no beginning or end within a creation; it circles
back on itself to be fully enclosing in all dimensions. The smallest
becomes the largest, and the largest circles back to become, in
time, the smallest. And outside all dimensions She supports them,
and feeds them.&quot;
<p>
Now I am back in the mauve sea of the
first vision, with the pearls floating around me. And every one
of them contains all that I have seen here, the entire circle
of creation from largest to smallest. I feel myself dissolving
into that sea.
<p>
(Here the seer abandoned the vision
and went to meditate. He found himself dissolving and re-forming
many times over the next half-hour, at which time he reformulated
himself by his will and went about his daily business.)
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
Here again we have a presentation related
to the Mother aspect of divinity, without any reference to a particular
path of the Tree of Life. Perhaps this and the previous two visions
serve as a general introduction in a way roughly analogous to
that in which the three Parts of LIL served for the Parts as a
whole and for the Father aspect. Note the contrast between the
theme of division and conflict there and the theme of non-division
and continuity here.
<p>
The deep, still water of the opening
image reflects the Piscean attribute of the Zodiacal King. Possibly
the rain does as well, as a representation of the biblical Flood.
The mauve coloration of the water may be a blind for the invisible
&quot;ultraviolet&quot; that is the King Scale color of the sign.
<p>
The presentation of the Mother as &quot;undivided&quot;,
etc. is typical of Binah, but I believe that a higher state is
meant here, with Binah being its reflection, or that portion of
it that can be experienced within the limits of the terrestrial
Tree of Life. In standard cabalistic terms the Mother of Binah
is co-equal with or slightly inferior to the Father in Chokmah,
where here it is stated to be definitely superior in some sense.
<p>
However, the next three paragraphs definitely
relate to Binah; whether they also relate to that higher level
I cannot know. The movement into and back out of the pearl connects
to one Binah experience in which the finite levels are perceived
as being &quot;sealed off&quot; in some way from the transcendental
levels, with the internal finite events being irrelevant or meaningless
within the larger context.
<p>
In Friday's vision the Piscean element
is stronger. The sea becomes the true Piscean King Scale color.
The forms all relate in some way to Pisces experiences: the cube
and hole are the perception of the emptiness of a purely finite
existence; Cerberus is Hell or suffering; the candle-holder is
devotion to God, overcoming suffering; and Christ is the final
salvation. The whole series is a summary of the religious (as
distinct from the magickal) interpretation of the universal formula
of INRI.
<p>
The vision then returns to the idea
of the Mother as the Universal Container. The words speak of the
Black and White Brothers, but the unspoken subtext had a slightly
different import. Whether one moves towards the seeming unity
of the Father, or towards the chaos at the roots of being, one
eventually encounters her and must dissolve oneself in her to
attain her level. In fact, with the principle that there are many
Fathers, as spoken earlier, the difference between the endpoints
disappears. If there are a multitude of creative realms on the
cosmic level then the conditions there must be similar in gross
outline to conditions on the sub-atomic level. Thus in the final
image one turns into the other. <br>

<p>
Zamfres, Part 22 of 91, 1st of ZID.
Zodiacal King: Gebabal. Ministers: 4362. Mundane association:
Mantiana (a mountainous region along the western border of current-day
Iran, where it meets Turkey and Iraq. East of Lake Van, west of
Lake Urmia.)
<p>
Invoked Zamfres according to the usual
custom. Vibrating the name Gebabal produced an unusually strong
response.
<p>
As the vision opened I was looking at
the mundane region (of Zamfres) from above. For a moment the two
lakes to either side became the eyes of some god looking back
at me; the twin rows of mountains running north-south between
them became the bridge of his nose. The spreading Tigris-Euphrates
flood plain to the south became the fleshy part of his nose. Then
the eyes closed, and a pressure I was not aware of eased, as if
some great being had judged me and found me too inconsequential
to deal with.
<p>
The glyph of Cancer formed about the
lakes, each at the center of one of the glyph's circles. The two
curved arms above and below encircled and enclosed the region
ruled by Zamfres. 
<p>
The voice said: &quot;Ea rules the great
subterranean sea, and his eyes upon the world are those lakes
that you see. Therein, it is said, he concentrates the salts that
would otherwise dispel the purity of his realm; for the underground
sea is fresh, not salt water, and the springs of the Earth do
come forth from it.
<p>
&quot;Now in the spring of one year
did the waters below burst forth; not in refreshing fountains
but in great gouts of water that did destroy all about. And the
rains came as well, out of season, and with the tears of Ea, that
flow from his eyelids, did inundate the lands of men.
<p>
&quot;Fifteen cubits did the waters
rise, and the cities and fields of men were awash. Covered over
were the cities of men, for they did dwell beside the rivers.
Covered over were the fields of men, not with the life-renewing
floods of normal times, but with the destroying waters. And the
great Temples and groves of the Mother were all destroyed.
<p>
&quot;It is said that Enlil caused this
destruction, because the noise of men kept him from sleeping.
And this is not so, for the noise did bother him not because of
loss of sleep, but because that noise was raised in worship of
the Mother, holy Inanna, and little of it was raised in his own
praise. Thus did jealousy, hid secretly in the heart, cause the
destruction of the world by water.
<p>
&quot;And in this time was one man saved,
along with his people. Ea whispered in his ear, the ear of Ziusudra,
and did cause him to raise up a ship fit to withstand the flood.
And this ship was itself an act of worship -- did it not have
seven decks, and were not they divided each into nine compartments?
Thus it was a Temple of the World, to hold all the world within
it.
<p>
&quot;And into the boat did Ziusudra
take all that was needful for the restarting of the world. Of
people and animals and goods did he take all that was needful,
and all his wealth as well. And in the time of the flood, when
the rains came with great destruction, and the waters rose up
to destroy men's abodes, and the great wind out of the south blew,
then did Ziusudra enter his boat, and come to be saved. And all
his people with him.
<p>
&quot;The great south wind, raised by
the god, did blow the ship northwards, unto the brow of Ea. And
there, when the waters receded, did it come to rest. And when
the birds did show that the Earth was safe to trod upon again,
then did Ziusudra come forth with all his people and make great
sacrifices to the gods. And the gods were needful of this, and
partook of the sacrifice with great hunger. As it is written:
'The gods hovered about the sacrifice like flies about the offering.'
<p>
&quot;And the gods did rebuke the Destroyer
for seeking to bring about the end of Man. For without man, who
would feed the gods? Who would supply them with offerings of meat,
and grain, and beer? And who would, in their own time, replace
them? And so the gods placed a protection upon mankind, that they
not again be destroyed.
<p>
&quot;And Ziusudra and his wife, they
made into gods; granting them the immortality of the gods, and
giving them to dwell ever after in paradise, beyond the mouths
of the waters.&quot;
<p>
&quot;And so goes the tale of the flood,
o man. And you have wondered over it, seeking its significance.
But what other significance could it have but that great process
hidden in INRI? [A thought of annoyance from me evokes an amused
tone from the Voice.] You cannot escape it, o man, it is everywhere.
Consider:
<p>
It is Inanna, the earth-mother, of whom
Enlil is jealous. Enlil himself brings destruction, and so is
Scorpio-water. Ea who is Shamash preserves him, and forces Enlil
to give him a &quot;soul even like unto that of the gods.&quot;
Earth, Death-Water, Sun, and Air or Spirit -- thus again does
INRI intrude into the affairs of men. 
<p>
&quot;Now there is more to be seen here,
now that this is out of the way. This is indeed the power of Zamfres
manifesting, and in another time we will show you a different
view.
<p>
&quot;Come again, and see. We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
I had been invoking Zamfres informally
for a couple of days before this vision. About all I got out of
these invocations was a mild obsession with the Flood story. But
it didn't seem quite to connect. I suspect that this recitation
of the Babylonian Flood story is to get this (possibly superficial)
interpretation of the Part's power out of the way, so that something
more direct and meaningful can come through. 
<p>
The vision of the previous Part mentioned
the &quot;waters below&quot;; Ea is a personification of them.
Since the entire world (from the Babylonian viewpoint) is part
of this Face of Ea, this is a repetition of the idea previously
put forth that water surrounds the universe. 
<p>
The &quot;tears of Ea&quot; are the
meltwaters that normally caused the Tigris and Euphrates to rise
and renew the soil of Mesopotamia in spring. These come from the
mountains surrounding the two lakes Van and Urmia, and thus metaphorically
 leak from the eyelids of the god. 
<p>
One can imagine the Babylonian version
of the Flood having some basis in reality. The topography of the
region is such that it wouldn't take a great deal of extra water
to flood most of the inhabited areas of Mesopotamia. In the days
before flood-control, the Mississippi and Missouri rivers regularly
flooded much larger areas. Unusually heavy rains could easily
produce such an effect without any miraculous intervention. Since
Enlil is the god of storms, he would naturally be blamed for it
by the survivors.
<p>
Ziusudra's boat is said to be a Temple
of the World. He was instructed to build it as a cube 120 cubits
in every dimension; thus its three dimensions sum to 360, the
numerical symbol of the circle (which originated with the Babylonians).
Within the circle of the universe, it has seven levels for the
seven planets. Each level has nine compartments, which I speculate
corresponds not to the usual lunar symbolism, but to the nine
fruits on the Tree of the World -- roughly equivalent to the sephiroth.
So it encompasses both the heavens and the Earth within its design.
<p>
The interpretation of the story in terms
of the INRI formula distorts the attributes of the gods somewhat.
In Babylonian terms Ea is a god of Water and Enlil is an Earth-god.
With Anu they make up the prime triumvirate of the pantheon. They
correspond to the Greek triumvirate of Poseidon, Pluto, and Zeus,
who divided up the world between them.
<p>
But the association is probably valid
anyway. The Earthy aspect of the story is the prediluvian world
of Mesopotamia -- fertile, wealthy, and happy. The Scorpio aspect
is the Flood itself. Ziusudra survives by creating a microcosm
-- metaphorically discovering his solar self. And the granting
of a god-like spirit raises him into the Airy realm of the final
&quot;I&quot; of INRI.
<p>
Incidentally, the Part's mundane region,
Mantiana, was at one time the Kingdom of Ararat, the same &quot;mountains
of Ararat&quot; where Noah's Ark landed after the biblical version
of the story.
<p>
Wednesday, July 19, 1995
<p>
After yesterday's work, I had an increasingly
strong conviction that I hadn't really penetrated into the core
of the part. The vision of the Flood seemed at least somewhat
appropriate, given the zodiac association of the ruling King;
but I felt that it had been thrown off by the Part as a diversion,
or in the way that some lizards will sacrifice their tails in
order to escape being eaten. 
<p>
Late last night (this morning rather,
around 12:30 am) I invoked the Part again with the intent to examine
its energies and see if I could get a clearer perception of what
was going on. I did not record the work at the time, in order
that I could give all of my attention to the task.
<p>
The first invocation produced a sense
of energy basically similar to what I got during the vision. But
there was also a sense of something behind it that was of a different,
deeper character. Repeating the invocations, I began to perceive
the superficial energies as a shell surrounding this core; it
seemed to produce a centripetal effect in anything that touched
it. That is, it imparted a sideways vector, the way a spinning
object will knock away anything that hits it at some odd angle.
<p>
I did additional invocations, calling
repeatedly upon the God of Hosts and the Enochian God by his twelve
names, in addition to the usual names associated with the Part.
This seemed to increase the power of that central core, but did
nothing towards enabling me to enter it.
<p>
At some point, I decided a diversion
of my own was in order. If the defenses of this place were set
against my usual astral body, then perhaps using a different one
would enable me to pass them. For many years I have worked at
developing a second astral body in female form; it is a construct
intended to provide a sensory base in which I could explore the
&quot;feminine&quot; mode of my own personality. It was never
intended to be used for magickal work, but I tried to use it so
now. Leaving my regular magickal body in place, I transferred
my awareness to this other body, and moved it around to one side
of the region I was trying to enter. Then I tried to slip in while
the defenses were still focused elsewhere. 
<p>
It seemed to work, to some extent. I
felt that I was &quot;inside&quot; the region and was feeling
its power around me instead of from outside. Almost as soon as
I entered, some slight modifications occurred to the body. An
Egyptian &quot;Crown of the North&quot; -- shaped somewhat like
a red shmoo -- appeared on my head, with the plumes of Maat mounted
to either side of it. The facial features took on a nilotic cast,
and the eyes turned from green to brown. The hair remained black.
(I was seeing this reflected on the inside of the aura around
the body.) A dress formed around me, reminiscent of the styles
in ancient Egyptian stele.
<p>
I moved further in, and more changes
took place. The crown disappeared, to be replaced by a built-up
hair style (I forget what women call it -- beehive?) with the
hair threaded around with thin golden ropes. My hair became very
wavy where before it was straight. The dress changed into the
&quot;Cretan&quot; style -- breasts exposed but pushed up by a
tight corset-like jacket, long skirt. Bracelets in the form of
serpents appeared on my wrists. I felt several inches taller as
well. 
<p>
In both of these forms, I felt very
like a priestess. But it was as if I was remembering and taking
on an old form rather than manufacturing the feelings from my
imagination. 
<p>
Now I was simultaneously in this body,
and viewing it and its surroundings from above and behind her.
I made some sorts of gestures -- the nature of which I don't recall
now -- and called upon the Gods and the names of the Part again.
A brilliant aura formed about me, and it seemed that stars played
about on its surface. 
<p>
There appeared before me a large group
of beings; I could not tell if their forms were male or female.
The each wore clothes like those of a dervish-dancer, save that
a small cap with cylindrical sides about two inches high was added.
And instead of the dervish's white, these were covered in intricate
geometric patterns, in which red and yellow predominated.
<p>
These beings began to dance, a dance
composed mostly of spinning motions but with an occasional leap
or lifted leg. Their skirts flared out as they spun, revealing
bare feet. Their spinning motion carried them each sideways, moving
in arcs punctuated sometimes by small loops. Their was no regular
pattern to their movements; the motion carried them randomly around
the visible area, and sometimes out of it. I took these beings
to be the ministers of the Part, and their motions to be in some
way dictated by the Part's energies. I watched, trying to feel
the power behind them.
<p>
After ten minutes of this, I began to
feel myself drifting from a meditative state towards sleep, so
I ended the work and returned to my physical body. Waiting to
fall asleep, I still felt my female astral body distinctly, though
it remained more or less congruent with my physical body. An aura
remained around me, in which a horde of tiny, shimmering pentagrams
flashed about. Eventually this subsided, and I slept.
<p>
Writing this all down, I seem to have
re-invoked something of last night's power. I can hear the Voice
of the Part saying:
<p>
&quot;Hail unto She who is the night-sky;
she has come to us! She whose eyes and hair are the darkness of
night; whose crown is made of stars; whose necklace is of lapis
set in silver. She who encompasses all within herself; from whose
womb all things come, and from whose breasts comes the milk of
her heart to feed them. This is she whose power is one with all
gods; whose womb opens to them that they might create children
to fill all lands and times. Whom the Serpent serves in all things;
acknowledge Her, o Serpent, and be one with her!&quot;
<p>
I feel that this last is directed at
me, and raise my awareness in a focus of greeting and contact.

<p>
&quot;Now comes the Serpent, her servant
in all things, who has carried her will in the world since the
time of man was not yet born. He is the Snake whose burrowing
undermines all realities, dispersing their solidity [or, possibly
&quot;breaking their forms&quot;] so that her power shall shine
in the depths as it does in the heights of the night-sky. Think
ye, o man, that your work is in vain? Think not so; it shall be
fulfilled. That which comes as a sun in the sky is not all of
the spirit; that which penetrates unknown is often more effective,
and shall have longer effect. [I don't know what inspired these
last comments.]
<p>
&quot;O Serpent, come you now or later,
and you shall see what is here. Come in your female form, girt
about with your ensigns of office, and we shall let you enter
here and know for all to see.&quot;
<p>
I feel that I need a little more practice
before trying to use my female body in my normal visionary mode;
it is too difficult to split my focus between seeing and recording.
So I indicate that I will do so at another time.
<p>
&quot;Then we are done for now. Farewell.&quot;
<p>
Friday, July 21, 1995  10:46 AM
<p>
Invoked Zamfres with the usual method.
I formulated my magickal body in a female form, dressed as a priestess
of Inanna.
<p>
The sigil of the Part rose up out of
the circle and hung before me in the air. A second copy of it
split from the first, flipped over on its vertical axis and moved
to one side. Now a long staff like a shepherd's staff came up
from below and stopped between them; it was a plain wooden staff
with a small knob on the top end. 
<p>
The two sigils became serpents, and
moved inwards to wrap themselves around the staff. Their tails
touched the staff, their heads faced outwards to either side.
<p>
The voice said: &quot;The Serpent is
Her symbol of Life, for serpents were at one time thought to be
generated spontaneously out of Her substance; the livingness of
the world became too full, and concentrated and manifested itself
in these sinuous forms. 
<p>
&quot;Later on it became known that
the powers of life in the body flow also in these forms around
the staff of the spine. And so this symbol before you was formed
as the embodiment of Her power. This has been Her symbol since
time immemorial, in many places; only in more recent times did
some steal it for the symbol of a male god. 
<p>
&quot;Take the staff, for it is yoursas Her servant in all things.&quot;
<p>
I reached out and grasped the staff
and felt a rush of kundalini-like power through my body. I only
held it for a moment and then it merged with me; the knob of the
staff in the center of my head, the heads of the serpents coincident
with my eyes. 
<p>
And now before me I again saw the image
of Mesopotamia and the regions north of it. It seemed that the
Tigris and Euphrates delineated the sides of some mystical staff
overlaid upon the land; they were actually the Serpents entwined
about it. The two salt lakes became the heads of the Serpents,
and the mountains to the north between them became the knob of
the staff.
<p>
&quot;All this land is Hers, o priestess;
it always has been and always will be. Though the man-gods rule,
yet their activities are those of children playing in a house
their mother made, not understanding how she maintains it even
as they make use of it unthinking. 
<p>
&quot;It is here in her Womb that she
brought forth her gifts to mankind; writing, agriculture, crafts
and cities; history, the memory that lasts beyond the lives of
a generation; the cooperation of great numbers to ease the labor
of all. In this place were they born, and here will her other
gifts return to mankind in other days.
<p>
&quot;What boots it if for a time the
children play, while Her attention is elsewhere? She made these
things for them, and if they now think they are Lords of Creation,
in time they will remember and come back to her. The motions of
time [i.e., the last few thousand years of history] are a short
holiday afternoon to her, as well you know.
<p>
&quot;When they hunger with the true
hunger of the divine, then will She answer them; when they tire
of snacking on Seed, and desire the nourishing Milk, she will
feed them until they are full up. In the meantime, she lets them
go; how else do children grow, but through play and experiment?&quot;
<p>
A playful atmosphere comes to the vision.
At the same time I feel the clitoris of this body hardening and
sticking up out of its fold. A flashed image comes of a woman's
sex in a state of arousal.
<p>
&quot;And this that you see is the true
origin of the Serpent's symbolism. She sticks her head out of
the furrow when the flows of life are at their greatest. Of such
small things are great truths formed. [A sense of giggling, teasing
amusement here.] Only a man, divorced from the land, could think
that his ponderous club sticking up in the air is the embodiment
of the snake's power. No; the snake stays hidden in the folds
of the Earth, close to its burrow, and only comes out into the
light of day when the rains fill up the Earth and the spring overflows.&quot;
[The correspondences of this metaphor should be obvious.]
<p>
At this point both the vision and the
voice dissolved into a rich turquoise illumination. For twenty
minutes or so I assumed the throne asana (with both physical and
astral bodies) and simply experienced it. 
<p>
The voice returned:
<p>
&quot;Now, what would we say to a woman
who comes here? You shall not know. For even though you come in
the image of your past selves, yet in this present time is your
finite being shaped to other purposes, as you know. No matter
the accuracy of your reproduction [of your past self] it lacks
the foundation in daily life to truly comprehend the basis of
womanhood; and memory [of past lives] fails when the nerves and
body are not suitable.
<p>
&quot;And even a woman of your times
would have trouble finding the essence in this place; for the
thoughts of the world [i.e. public and social expectations] are
a pressure upon all, shaping and distorting even where the individual
is suited to see what we have here.
<p>
&quot;Yet we would say to her: Come
here, and experience the freedom of the goddess. Know the exaltation
of womanhood as it was in times before the dominance of men. Know
what it is to love who you chose, when you chose, without obligation,
without being owned or limited even by the pressures of society.
Know what it is to chose the fathers of your children as you will,
with full awareness that the children will be yours, and yours
alone, with neither obligations to or duties expected from those
men. Know the great freedom, as it once was and as it will be
again in future times.
<p>
&quot;Beyond this, we will not speak
at this time [on this subject].
<p>
&quot;Now, o servant of the goddess,
prophet of the snake: Remember as you can these past times, and
incorporate them into yourself. You will see, in time, where all
this is leading; even Understanding is insufficient when the times
are not yet right for revelation. It may be they will never be
right, while this body of yours yet lives. The future is not,
despite the claims of some; there is no inevitable destiny to
events, requiring that they come will-ye or nil-ye. All is change,
all is flux, until the moment of manifestation comes.
<p>
&quot;You have known that some of your
duties in this life are contingent upon events; if those events
never come, then other things will be found [for you to do]. It
matters not; great destiny or small, it is all the same. Do as
your nature and the circumstances dictate, and let what shall
come do so in its own manner. Seek not to form events; the responsibility
for this lies elsewhere. Dance the dance, and enjoy.
<p>
&quot;You are many things, too many
to describe or enumerate. You are fully a human being, yet you
are also like unto the servants and ministers of God. You are
the lost past and the distant future. You carry a god within you,
and are one with that god, and yet you are not [one]. Everything
that one might say about you is contradicted in some particular.
All categories fail in describing you. Therefore explain not,
describe not, and ignore descriptions; simply be, and act. 
<p>
[Something here about future visions
in this series, which I did not catch.]
<p>
&quot;We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
As near as I can gather, this Part defines
the relationship between woman as a finite being and the Mother
as transcendental Being shown in the two previous parts. Even
the portion I was able to experience (during the meditative hiatus)
was astounding. There was a great deal I intuitively apprehended
about the  attitudes necessary to perfect such a link; but I find
them impossible to describe. All the English terms that bear on
the matter are pejorative in one way or another; the language
lacks any means of speaking of it in a positive manner.
<p>
It is easy enough to read over this
vision and the previous two Parts and extract the essentials.
What is not so easy is to imagine a social context in which these
things are the height of respectability; in which the woman who
achieves them has not only her personal will to sustain her, but
religious cachet and a supportive social structure to help her
maintain the state. I doubt it would be possible to fully realize
all aspects of the relationship in any &quot;civilized&quot; social
context that exists today; they have all been too poisoned by
Aryan attitudes.
<p>
Other than this, there is little to
say. The sections dealing with the Serpent symbolism are self-explanatory.

<p>
Overall, the three days work on this
Part all relate in a general way to the zodiac sign of Cancer.
Cancer is primal Water, hence the Flood symbolism. Cancer is the
sign of Motherhood, so the rest fits in well enough. The erratic
dancing of the ministers might be associate with Cancer as the
Crab, which moves in skittering, sideways jerks.
<p>
There is also some small indication
that we are moving out of a general presentation on the divine
Mother and back into presentations more closely related to the
paths of the Tree of Life. The image of the Mother as star-goddess
relates to the path of Aquarius, which connects Binah with Chokmah
in Frater Achad's Tree of Life. No doubt this connection will
be explained more closely in other Parts.<br>

(Note to myself: The sigil for this

-- Dee's version is more compact. My version takes the letters
in their proper sequence, but adds a superfluous line, making

<p>
Sunday, July 23, 1995  11:27 AM
<p>
The vision began with an image of a
featureless circular area of a brownish-yellow color, surrounded
by a necklace made of tiny rosette-like forms mounted on a thin
chain. The rosettes each appeared to have a blue center, with
white petals in a single circle around the center. Each petal
was trapezoidal, the long parallel side as the outer edge. They
seemed to be made of some enamel or ceramic.
<p>
Now the image shifted slightly and the
central portion became a barren sandy waste, the rosettes became
oases around its edge, and the chain became trade roads between
them.
<p>
The image shifted again, and now there
was a great lion, roaring and leaping about with frantic energy.
His fur stuck out from his body in every direction, every hair
vibrating, but moving in a different way from all the others.
Flames came from his mouth, but did not harm anything -- there
was nothing but sand there. There was no purpose to his movements,
no object or intent. I felt a sense of pity for him, wasting his
energy in violent, empty motion.
<p>
Now a woman appeared, dressed in a thin
white robe. She was golden-haired and had brown skin. She placed
her hand upon the lion as he came past in his leaping, and he
immediately stopped; but still he quivered with power looking
for an exit. The woman stroked the lion for a time. Then she lay
down on his back, resting her head on his neck, with her body
and legs along his spine. 
<p>
Her aura had radiated a sense of soothing
calmness. Now it took on a very odd quality, sinuous and serpent-like.
Gravity seemed to have no effect upon her; she was attached to
the lion by some inner force of hers which negated anything else
that might affect her. She began to glide around the lion's body,
keeping full contact with it at all times. Like a snake wrapped
around a tree she circled and looped around him, down and under,
up and over, in every direction. &quot;Glide&quot; is the precise
word; she encountered no friction at all as she moved. Very sensual.
<p>
A change came over the lion from her
actions. His energies before were not only without direction,
they vibrated in every possible manner simultaneously, and changed
and shifted chaotically. But the woman's actions seemed to bring
order to them, sorting them out by type and nature, and brought
focus to them as well. His fur settled and smoothed, his mane
combed itself into neatness.
<p>
It seemed that the woman coupled with
the lion for a moment, and took a measure of his power into herself.
As she did her aura expanded to totally surround the lion, enclosing
him as her womb enclosed his member. A sense of great pleasure
filled the air; entirely sexual but in no way tense. 
<p>
Now the woman glided around again to
the lion's back, and sat astride him. He looked about for a moment,
and then began to move purposefully away from this place. It was
his own purpose he followed; the woman rode him, but did not direct
his course. 
<p>
The voice spoke:
<p>
&quot;It was said that Babalon was a
harlot, but this is not so, save in the minds of the perverted
who can imagine no other view. She is qadish, the pure and holy
one, and it is her holiness that allows her to take all men into
herself. By doing so she affirms herself, transcending all natures
by enclosing them. If one man is wicked, it matters not to her;
if another is good, she takes him as joyfully. Each benefits thereby,
and her sanctity is increased by her actions. 
<p>
&quot;Yet if man is so caught up in
his own &quot;superiority&quot;, if he thinks he must degrade
her to raise himself up, if he refuses her divinity in her acts
of love; then he loses her and must go alone in the world, unsanctified,
wasting himself in empty works. For it is she who gives focus
and order to his work; in his union with her is his true will
revealed. She does not guide; his own nature guides him. Yet without
her does his nature go astray.
<p>
&quot;Give praise to the holy one, mother
and lover, the source of comfort. Her love surpasses understanding,
yea, surpasses even the crown. In the secret places of the unmanifest,
she is All, and None; there is nothing she does not encompass
within herself, yet she is greater than all of them together.
Meet her joyfully, o man, and embrace her as your lover.
<p>
At this point I fell into a meditative
trance on the energies of the Part. No further vision came.
<p>
Monday, July 24, 1995  12:57 PM
<p>
The vision opened with another view
of the necklace seen yesterday. But now the yellow-brown area
in the center was a large high-cabochon cut topaz; the center
of each rosette was an ice-blue diamond, and the petals were feathers,
in which all colors coruscated beneath their overall whiteness.
The whole was a huge brooch or medallion, mounted on a ribbon
colored like a lapis stone; the ribbon was the Milky Way. It was
worn around the neck of some great being who could only be sensed
vaguely, not seen.
<p>
I seem to be having some trouble; nothing
more wants to come. Odd, since when I was sitting on my bed invoking
the Part, all sorts of visions rushed about me. Now sitting in
front of my computer, there is nothing.
<p>
While doing the invocation I had two
important realizations, received mostly in a visual/intuitive
form. Translated into words:
<p>
First, concerning the nature of the
Enochian system. I have said many times that this magick connects
with absolutely everything that exists, on Earth or off it. It
touches every part of the universe regardless of whether it is
part of our Earthly scheme of creation. My work with the &quot;Lotus
of the Temple&quot; shows that it connects to some very strange
places indeed.
<p>
As has been stated several times in
these visions every &quot;male&quot; seed, every act of creation
by some entity, creates a region -- a &quot;zone of power&quot;
-- with a definite thematic and energetic content. That is, it
is limited in the sense that anything with a definite nature excludes
from itself things not of that nature. Since the Enochian magick
connects together a multitude of different creative zones, it
follows that it cannot be a &quot;creation&quot; in the same sense
that those zones are; otherwise some regions must necessarily
be excluded from connection by its incompatible nature. The Enochian
magick must instead be a manifestation of the &quot;female&quot;
aspect of divinity, as it has been described in this and the preceding
Parts; the Enochian God may very well be an Enochian Goddess.

<p>
This would account for the way the magick
always seems to enter a particular region along some dimension
that doesn't exist inside the region; and for the peculiar &quot;twist&quot;
it sometimes puts on our view of a region. The connections exist
in the transcendent aspect of the divine Woman, so would appear
to be irrational or indescribable within any particular finite
frame of reference. It would also account for the way that the
&quot;regular&quot; angels and gods of the Tablets often show
deeper natures totally different from their superficial, &quot;elemental&quot;
classifications.
<p>
The second realization concerns the
Call of the Aethyrs. The recent Parts describe the universe as
a single transcendental Female aspect, within which a multitude
of creative &quot;fathers&quot; work their will. These creations
do not exist in isolation; they interact with each other. Being
of many different (and complex) natures, they must necessarily
come into conflict as often as they are compatible or irrelevant
to each other. Within the enfolding Mother's influence, they sometimes
compete, sometimes cooperate, and are sometimes irrelevant to
each other. In short, they form a complex dynamic system -- an
&quot;ecology&quot;, if you will -- in which everything affects
everything else, but in ways that do not have predictable outcomes.

<p>
If we accept this view, then the &quot;curse&quot;
of the Call becomes nothing of the kind; it is simply a poetic
description of the actual way of things. I will not analyze the
Call in detail until I think about this further.
<p>
There was also an appearance by the
lion, but it only repeated things from the first vision, from
its own viewpoint. Nothing significant in its speech.
<p>
Wednesday, July 26, 1995  12:45 PM
<p>
The vision opened looking into the topaz
at the center of the brooch seen previously. The Lion appeared
therein, and suddenly I was the Lion, looking outwards. The lion's
mane rose from his head and formed a cloud around it, as if held
out by static electricity. As suddenly, all of the lion except
the mane collapsed into a tiny point and disappeared; there was
nothing left but these charged lines radiating out in every direction,
a sphere with no point at its center. My awareness went into these
lines. I noted that each of them was a different color and seemed
to carry a different type or frequency of energy. Individual lines
changed their position in the sphere constantly, so that there
was no steadiness or continuity.
<p>
Now I saw the glyph of the Sun before
me. Sparks of lightning leapt from the central point to the peripheral
circle all around its circumference. A hand came in from outside
the picture, and cut the circle; the circle disappeared and all
the energy of the point went into the lightning leaping outwards;
the point also disappeared. The lines of lightning spread out
and vanished from the picture, each taking an erratic, spinning
path.
<p>
The voice said:
<p>
&quot;The Father is the Son shorn of
his enclosure, which is the contribution of the Mother. The nature
of the Father is to project itself outwards in all directions;
it loses itself in the motion, and is no more. Without the enclosing
love of the Mother, the Father expends his power to no purpose;
it neither creates nor exalts its creator.
<p>
&quot;She reflects his power back upon
itself, enclosing it and forcing it into a narrow passage. It
is thereby constricted, but its remains intact and undispersed.
<p>
&quot;She also provides a focusing effect.
Without her enclosure, the power radiated in every direction,
each individual type moving by itself . Now, with her circle about
Him, the energy is folded over on itself; that is, powers that
are harmonic with each other, which belong to the same &quot;chord&quot;
of vibration, are gathered together and focused on a particular
point on the rim of the enclosed region. Remember the original
image of this part:&quot;
<p>
I saw again the first image of the Part,
a chain of rosettes around a hot barren area. The rosettes now
each seemed to vibrate with a different quality, shining outwards
into the surrounding world and also back towards the center of
the ring. 
<p>
&quot;The many qualities inherent in
the Father's original impulse cannot be re-unified. They cannot
be brought back together in the center of the circle and fused
into a single point. Different groups of those energies are inherently
incompatible with each other; once separated, they never rejoin.
<p>
&quot;The real powers of the Son lie
in these nodes upon the perimeter of his region; there is no true
center, no individual, no point-like interior &quot;I&quot; to
be found. But the nodes interact with each other, exchanging energy,
cooperating and interfering with each other in many ways. And
this intense interaction generates the illusion [word emphasized]
of an individual, whose nature is determined by the pattern of
those interactions. 
<p>
&quot;This is the meaning of the Buddha's
dictum, that there is no permanence within the skandha of consciousness.
For consciousness (and especially self-consciousness) arises out
of the interaction of these nodes of power, which are not themselves
conscious. And consciousness is entirely dependent upon their
interaction; its specific state at any point in time is determined
by the momentary state of those interactions in their ongoing,
perpetual changes. 
<p>
&quot;If they change, so it changes.
And yet...[brief pause] it seems at times as if this meta-creature,
this abstract gloss upon the reality, itself is able to generate
a will-to-change within the nodes from which it arises. Does this
mean that it actually does have some existence separate from its
supports? No; for what appears to be self-will arises not out
of the illusory Self, but in a higher realm all together. It is
a third factor, beyond the Father and Mother as they exist in
the Tree, which enters into the equation. All will is really the
divine Will, expressing itself through the medium of a Son. 
<p>
&quot;This divine Will is of great importance;
for it is the source of the urge to evolve, to move upwards in
the planes of existence, which is the process of initiation. It
is the Will which makes such changes possible at all; without
it there would be only gradual, almost accidental movements in
that direction, quickly lost again. It comes from outside [emphasized]
to work changes within the finite being. Why does it do so? We
know not. How does it do so? By its own nature. When does it do
so? According to its own judgment (if judgment it truly has),
and not according to the desires of the being in whom it acts.
Once it comes, it is always present to some degree, but that degree
varies greatly in intensity, and therefore in what can be accomplished.

<p>
&quot;But when the will appears in the
man, it does not dictate the nature of change, but only enables
it. It is the task of the Son to seize the time and move upwards
according to its current state, its preparation for the moment,
and its desires of achievement. 
<p>
&quot;Now in the previous Parts, it
was shown how the woman might become the Mother, through direct
identification of their natures, by creating a congruence between
the acts and perceptions of the finite woman and the transcendental
nature of the Mother. One might interpret this as being mainly
a religious mode of work, but it is not so; it is a truly magickal
mode of work, and only the blindness of men makes it seem otherwise
to them.
<p>
&quot;Here in this Part we have the
key to how a man might come to know the Mother. This way is the
traditional way; we give here a slightly different viewpoint on
the matter.
<p>
&quot;The &quot;circle&quot; which the
Mother gives to the Son, the enclosing and defining perimeter,
is not Herself as such, but only a reflection. It is a ring-pass-not
in the Theosophical sense, a boundary which contains his energies
and focuses them. It is a limitation or wall in a way that she
herself is not, and is itself finite, not transfinite as she is.
<p>
&quot;But the Mother herself (in her
manifestation as Binah) can perform the enclosure of the Son's
energies as well as can that lesser circle. She already does so,
in fact, but the lesser circle blinds us to her presence. 
<p>
&quot;When the nodes of a finite being
have organized themselves and their interactions to the greatest
extent possible, and have eliminated any stray vibrations from
external sources, and have reached the highest possible &quot;charge&quot;
of power within the limits of the lesser circle; and the Will
is present in full force. Then it is possible for the man to break
down the lesser circle, to cut it away as did the hand in the
image we showed you, and release its energies outwards. 
<p>
&quot;Since the existence of the individualized
&quot;self&quot; is dependent upon that circle, and upon the nodes
of power it creates from the Father's energies, then the destruction
of that circle causes the destruction of that self. The energies
of the nodes are released and expand outward as is their nature
when unconstrained, their interactions stop for a time, and the
illusion of Self ceases. 
<p>
&quot;But their movement is not entirely
unconstrained, for without the lesser circle, the Mother can come
into direct interaction with them. If each node is endowed beforehand
with enough energy, then when it is released the Mother's nature
takes it and encloses it in her being as it would an impulse directly
from the Father. It becomes concentrated again, but as water flows
into a hollow, not as fire is concentrated in a spark.
<p>
&quot;We are not saying this well; it
is a difficult thing. Perhaps an image would assist:&quot;
<p>
I saw a glyph of the sun, with tiny
points of power situated at various points around its circumference.
These points were very intense, like the sparks of an arc-welder.
Sharp lines of light shot between them, defining their interactions.
<p>
Then the circle was cut and the sparks
were released. Each moved outward radially, expanding from intense
points to less intense spheres of power as they went. The view
expanded to keep them all in sight, and as it did so I realized
that they were expanding into a great sea, a region of a watery
nature, whose nature had been previously concealed by the narrowness
of the view. 
<p>
As the spheres of power moved out in
this region, their nature changed. They seemed to take on a liquid
quality themselves. Their power was not reduced, but the urge-to-expand
(or urge-to-expend themselves) disappeared and was replaced with
a kind of &quot;contentment&quot; with their current state, a
sense of being in some way at rest. The outward motion ceased
and they were all left floating in the sea.
<p>
Indeed, aside from the obvious visual
distinction, I could not perceive any difference between these
spheres of power and the surrounding water; they seemed identical
in every other way. Now new visible flows began to connect them,
and these two were not in any appreciable way different from the
water in which they were.
<p>
The voice spoke again:
<p>
&quot;You see, when the powers are released
and expand into the larger realm of the mother, they cease to
be what they once were, and take on her nature. It is not actually
the same &quot;sparks&quot; that started outwards which come to
rest at the end of the movement. Rather, their power is expended
in her substance, and causes to arise an expression of her infinitude
that is of a similar nature; she is all things in herself, and
that which arises is simply a display of one aspect of what she
is.
<p>
&quot;The sparks of the Father (arising
out of the dead Son) are no more; what remains is entirely of
Her. Yet the pattern of the Son's nature is mostly intact, taken
back into herself. Consciousness returns with the interactions
of herself with herself within the pattern. Yet the &quot;self&quot;
that arises in out of that pattern knows itself to be nothing
but Her, indistinguishable from Her, inseparable from Her. The
appearance of a man, but not a man; the infinity of Her is always
present, the things which make him perceptible within her substance
are mere wavelets in her vast sea.
<p>
&quot;Now, because nothing of the Father
remains in him, this transcendent once-man can itself become the
Mother to a new impulse from the Father. And this is a key to
the grade of Magus. A new union of the divine parents comes about,
with the pattern within her receiving the Father's seed, and making
it into a son to manifest within the finite worlds.
<p>
&quot;But we have said enough, and more
than enough. We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
The image that opens both day's work
is based on the actual geography of the Sinkiang region of China.
There is a central desert, enclosed on either side by two seasonal
rivers, fed by meltwater from the surrounding mountain ranges.
Along the courses of the rivers are a chain of non-seasonal oases
that are the main habitable areas of the region.
<p>
Once again we are dealing with another
aspect of the divine Woman. We can see a progressive presentation
over the course of the last few Parts:
<p>
19 Opmacas: Declaration of a shift in
the visions from primarily &quot;male&quot; powers to primarily
&quot;female&quot; powers. Several traditionally male Paths of
the Tree are dealt with in a form that emphasizes the hidden female
factor.
<p>
20 Genadol: The divine Mother as a thing-in-herself.
Presentation of her most &quot;cosmic&quot; aspect, as Infinite
Space and, perhaps, whatever it is that encloses space and time.

<p>
21 Aspiaon: The relation between the
Mother and the finite worlds of creation, and with finite self-aware
beings as a general category.
<p>
22 Zamfres: The relation between the
Mother and women, typified through the symbolism of the old Goddess
religions.
<p>
23 Todnaon: The relation between the
Mother and men, typified through the traditional experience of
&quot;crossing the Abyss&quot;, but with a few twists on the usual
interpretation.
<p>
The visions themselves seem self-explanatory,
when taken together. I don't see any need for further comment.

<p>
Pristac, Part 24 of 91, 3rd of ZID.
Zodiacal king: Zarzilg  (Gemini) Ministers: 2302. Mundane association:
Gallia (France, Belgium, and Luxembourg)
<p>
Friday, July 28, 1995  2:00 p.m.
<p>
The vision opened with an image of France
seen from space. The sigil of the Part was superimposed thereon;
the left two segments were the coast of France, the point at the
top was the mouth of the Rhine, and the remaining segments became
the Rhine river.
<p>
A voice said: &quot;Gallia omnis est
diviso in tres partes.&quot; Julius Caesar's famous line. The
word &quot;omnis&quot; was emphasized. Then the voice added: &quot;Aquitania,
Belgica, et Celtica.&quot; Then, speaking English: &quot;And the
foremost of these is Aquitaine.&quot;
<p>
Now the image changed to one like the
card &quot;The Lovers&quot;, save that the angel was clearly female,
and the two other figures both male. One man looked upwards towards
the woman, the other looked down at the earth beneath his feet.
Their clothes changed into that of the medieval upper class. The
woman elaborately gowned in white, with a golden tiara holding
up an elaborate hairdo. The man looking up was dressed in red
and white, with a lion embroidered on the front of his tunic.
The other man was dressed in earthy colors, mostly black. I somehow
knew these people to be Eleanor of Aquitaine, and her two sons
Richard and John.
<p>
The voice said: &quot;The mother cannot
contain her nature within a single vessel, within the realms of
Air; therefor does she divide herself, giving to one the love
of the Spirit, to the other the love of the Earth. And between
them do her twin sons encompass what can be held of her in the
nature of men.
<p>
&quot;One seems to look downwards, the
other upwards; yet both look towards her. Is she not the enclosing
womb, both above and below, and upon all sides? Therefor do those
who worship Earth and its wealth worship her as well as those
who look upon her divinity. 
<p>
&quot;Think not that one [son] is greater
than the other. They are not above and below, but rather balanced
in perpetual interchange. The one who rides high in the sky as
often as not is the one who looks downward; he who enters the
Earth often serves her Spirit. Who should know this better than
you, o son of Set? 
<p>
&quot;If one son should die, fear not:
he shall return. For the Star is reborn from his passage through
the underworld; the Snake shed his skin and rises anew. The Conquering
Child does not conquer in truth, for his rival is always present,
even in death. And his turn in death also comes, when the Serpent
wraps him in its coils and smothers his light and glory. 
<p>
&quot;And there is a third always present
in their perpetual conflict; for they are bound by her Love. It
is only in the realization of that love in themselves that the
conflict ends; for when realization comes, there will remain no
difference between them. In the burning passions of love shall
they fuse into none, and bring the world back to lay in the Mother's
lap.
<p>
&quot;Their conflict is truly love,
though its form is violence. Yet the Love of Her is present even
in the world, without their presence; she sponsors it and promotes
it in those who feel her being, whether they know it or not. Desire,
romance, the ideals [idealizations?] of men for women, these are
of Her as well. They form the perpetual unseen background to the
transitory, foreground conflicts of her sons.&quot; 
<p>
[And I am reminded of Frank Herbert's
line, that no historian notices the woman working in the field
to support her children, because her husband has been called off
to war. This is yet another form of love.]
<p>
&quot;Now we have said enough; you understand,
and can explain if you will. We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
The visions continue their presentation
of various aspects of the Mother. This time it explains the reason
for the dual nature of her Sons. And as usual, there are many
echoes of Liber AL and Nuit.
<p>
The world of the Son, the Air or Ruach,
is characterized by dualities and oppositions. The human mind
naturally falls into thinking of things in dualistic terms, of
&quot;A&quot; and &quot;not-A&quot;, of &quot;higher&quot; and
&quot;lower&quot;. The message of this Part is that even within
the Ruach these dualisms are false, because there is always a
third factor present, which is the relationship between them.
If there is no connection between two things, then they cannot
be opposites. Connection requires similarity of nature, a negation
of differences in some dimension, which is a power of the Mother.
The dualities of the Ruach are really expressions of the Nought
of the Mother, and her undivided nature is constantly present
in the connection or Love that binds them together. 
<p>
&quot;The whole of Gaul is divided into
three parts.&quot; Given the emphasis on the word &quot;whole&quot;,
one might take this to mean that Gallia is itself a representation
of the divine mother, and the divisions are in some way manifestations
of her. (Apropos, France is usually symbolized as a woman.) The
A-B-C listing of those divisions is certainly significant, but
I don't know how. 
<p>
The second image changes the symbolism
of the Tarot card to fit better with the traditional &quot;Twins&quot;
myths, in which both human characters are male. In the unspoken
subtext of the vision, there was a definite sense that the woman
is Nuit, and the men are Hoor-pa-Kraat (Richard) and Ra-Hoor-Khuit
(John), thus calling in the symbolism of Liber AL. 
<p>
Eleanor of Aquitaine is perhaps the
best possible representative of the Mother in (relatively) recent
history. She was a great patron of the arts, the inspiration for
the idealized Love of the troubadours' Romantic movement, and
for the high-minded conceptions of chivalry that went with it.
But at the same time she had great political savvy and a was competent
ruler. These natures, united in her, were split in her sons. Richard
inherited the Romantic nature, running off to follow dreams of
glory in the Crusades; John inherited her political nature, and
sought to fuse the loose confederacy of English nobles into a
genuine monarchy. Thus her own undivided nature becomes dual in
the transition to the male mode.
<p>
Following this, the vision delves into
some alternate symbolism for the same thing. The &quot;one who
rides high in the sky&quot; is Horus, the one who &quot;enters
the Earth&quot; is Set. These two are then connected with Thelemic
symbolism: Horus is the Star, Set is the Snake. (This is a revisionist
use of these symbols.)
<p>
Since both poles of a duality are necessary
for either to exist, neither ever &quot;conquers&quot; the other.
If one pole should be &quot;killed&quot;, a new opposing pole
is immediately generated, with a new relationship joining them.

<p>
Friday, August 04, 1995  3:21 p.m.
<p>
The vision opens with an image of the
glyph of Taurus; the crescent separates from the circle, as in
the 20th Part, but here it moves upwards to become a sliver of
moon in the last stages of waning, where before it was a waxing
crescent.
<p>
There is a bitter taste to the air,
like alkaline dust. It brings with it feelings of loss and defeat,
of memories so old that their joy cannot be recalled, of things
buried and dead. A faint wailing can be heard, as of many women
crying for their dead lovers.
<p>
Now the voice says: &quot;The moon wanes;
the moon wanes; her blood is dried up, her moisture withdrawn
into the darkness, her life leached into the Earth carrying away
with it all save the dry bones of the land. [&quot;Leached&quot;
in the sense that water leaches caves out of limestone.] Her children
cannot find her; her husband has sought for her and been disappointed.
Nothing remains save the aching hearts of those who have known
her, and hunger for her presence. 
<p>
&quot;We who remain when she is gone
have nothing but ashes and heartbreak; our lives are torn and
rent, their wholeness shattered and scattered to the four winds.
[I get the impression that the spirits of the Parts are those
who remain. Possibly this has something to do with the curse of
Division that is the Call of the Aethyrs.] 
<p>
Were she here, we would be one; but
she sleeps the sleep that is like unto death, and none can awaken
her save one. And he wanders blind through the deserts of men,
taking their curse upon himself for their sake, and hers. 
<p>
&quot;Would that he could find her,
and put the taste of himself upon her lips! Would that she would
awaken thereby and make us whole again! Would that she would comfort
us in her embrace, erasing the tears and heartache of her absence!
<p>
&quot;O Men! Do as you would; without
her all is futile, your actions, however great, an aimless wandering.
Your joys, however powerful, a bitter dust. Nothing lasts; nothing
endures; nothing triumphs that does not also fall again. Look
on your own works, o you mighty ones, and despair! For they shall
not endure. Time shall wear them down to dust, and that dust shall
blow away. 
<p>
&quot;Woe! Woe! Woe! Yea, four and five
times woe unto us, and unto you, that our works are of no effect.
There is no Progress, but only change; an endless recycling of
old times, of old things, dressed up in youthful bodies, but not
made new thereby. 
<p>
&quot;Bitter, bitter, bitter are our
hearts.&quot;
<p>
On a parallel track, happening simultaneously
with the above, the wailing in the background grew stronger. An
image appears of many women, their heads covered with shawls and
dressed in black robes, wailing in sorrow and lamentation. The
pound their hands against an ancient wall, a mere fragment of
some greater structure that once stood there. It is the &quot;Wailing
Wall&quot; in Jerusalem.
<p>
The voice said: &quot;Before Solomon,
even before Yahweh was a glimmer in the mind of some priest, did
women come here to lament the passing of their loved ones. For
did not She also lament at the passing of Her lover, Dimuzi? The
stones of the wall are Her tears, which made the dust into mud,
which hardened into Stone. Her sacred precincts are gone, buried
under the rubble of later ages; yet Her memory still comes up
from the depths of women, and expresses itself in Her place. 
<p>
&quot;Yet it is not for Dimuzi that
they weep, nor truly for their loved ones. It is for Her that
they lament with such force, and for themselves. After many years,
they still feel the loss of her light and life, and lament the
degradation that loss brought upon their kind. [That is, upon
women.] The force of Heaven was withdrawn from them, and they
were trampled under the feet of men. Woe has been their lot, and
woe is what they express.&quot;
<p>
(I can sense there is more, but I cannot
endure this place any longer. I am being crushed by the despair
here. I am withdrawing from the vision.)
<p>
Monday, August 07, 1995  1:03 PM
<p>
As the vision opened, the sigil of the
Part was before my eyes. Behind it, an image of the Adriatic Sea
appeared, with the sigil overlaying a portion of the eastern side
roughly contiguous with what is currently called Bosnia. 
<p>
The image enlarged and at the same time
transformed in some way, so that a circular region became like
a lunar landscape -- or like land cratered by artillery bombardments.
The surrounding region became darker, barely visible. 
<p>
The voice said: &quot;Woe, woe is their
lot; from the beginnings of time until the end, nothing but woe
and pain. For they have conspired with evil and been touched thereby.
Evil eats itself, while good seeks to destroy it; thus nothing
they do can have a good end. 
<p>
Now there was a sound of a great many
marching troops. Out of the darkness surrounding the visible circle,
there came a horde of men dressed in armor. Each bore a shield
with the sun emblazoned on it; each carried a long spear or pike
with a golden tip. Each wore a white surcoat with a red eagle
upon it, and a black border. 
<p>
These men streamed towards the area
along paths from all sides. Like streams, these paths were narrow
at their beginning but widened as they progressed. All these paths
merged as they approached the encircled area, and the men spread
out to surround it, their spears all pointing inwards, forcing
back whatever might seek to leave the circle.
<p>
I get the impression that this all refers
both to the Roman conquest of the region, when it was a refuge
for pirates and raiders, and to the Nazi invasion, and to the
current conflict there.
<p>
The image transformed so that the lunar
component became dominant, and it was the Moon during a solar
eclipse. The men surrounding it became the corona of the Sun.
<p>
The voice said: &quot;When the darkness
reaches its greatest extent, then does the Sun blaze forth, overcoming
the loss of the Mother with the glory of the Son. So too in the
ages of history, for as the Mother's force faded in the world,
so did that of the Son, the Warrior-King, come forth and move
into its ascent. The aged Father lies hidden in darkness (as Osiris
is in the Underworld) a shadowy, ghostly influence upon events;
meanwhile the Son reaches forth and conquers what his Mother built.

<p>
&quot;And you ask: Where is the Daughter?
I say: She is her Mother, but laid low; there is no difference
between them, save that the Son's foot is now upon her neck, holding
her down that she might be more conveniently raped. And in that
rape does the Son see himself reborn, producing out of her a child
which is all His, and none of Hers. 
<p>
(The unspoken subtext says the Aryan
belief was that the deceased father of a king became his tutelary
spirit, wielding only a hidden advisory influence over his actions,
while the king's conquests -- and the &quot;glory&quot; accrued
thereby -- were all from the son's own work. They also believed
that a male child was a spiritual duplicate of its father, taking
nothing from its mother. So having many male children was a form
of immortality, a perpetuation of one spirit through many bodies.
The woman was a mere vehicle for this Solar Progress, and did
not participate in it herself. But she could become &quot;spoiled&quot;
if another man had her, causing the sons to be of a mixed nature.
Hence their obsession with making sure that all the children of
their wives were theirs. And the Hebrew practice of killing all
the men and married women in a conquered territory, while saving
the virgin women. And their practice of killing a married woman
who had been raped -- she could no longer produce &quot;pure&quot;
sons of her husband.)
<p>
&quot;It matters not that the Son's
belief is false. So long as he believes it, it perpetuates itself
in the minds of men even while their bodies partake secretly of
their mother's nature. 
<p>
&quot;And thus the power of the Mother,
her life and nurturance, fall down into darkness. What once covered
the world now must lie hidden, until the Son eventually falls.
Her powers of life, death, and renewal have been arrogated by
the Son, but he cannot maintain them; death he can manage, and
creation; but support and growth? These are not in his nature.
Nor are his creations all that he desires, for they must [emphasized]
partake of their mother's nature in order to live; thus they always
go astray from his plans. 
<p>
&quot;Now, in the succeeding Parts,
we shall see her again, as often as necessary. But for the moment
we shall be passing on to different ways of looking at things,
as the Parts shift in their relationships and their powers take
over different regions of existence on this world. What was once
so, is not now; what is now, will not be so. Change is perpetual
in the Parts, and what we see now may not be, when another comes
again. But these seven Parts shall remain Hers for some time to
come, and shall continue as expressions of Her many natures, which
are one. 
<p>
&quot;We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
This vision is clearly related to the
Moon in its final stages of waning, when the feminine power is
withdrawing from manifestation. Traditionally this is a time of
ill-luck, of  sorrow and death. Things begun at this time are
doomed to failure; other things experience a nadir of vitality,
an inability to go forward, and disruption from random events.
The futility of such times is reflected in Friday's vision. The
&quot;wailing wall&quot; scene iconifies it in the mythos of Inanna/Ishtar,
in the sorrow she feels at the death of her lover Dimuzi or Tammuz,
and then extends it into an expression of the endless suffering
of women under the Hebrew dispensation and its successors. 
<p>
Monday's vision suggests that the endless
fighting of the Balkan regions is due to a connection with this
darkest of the Mother's phases. It then moves into the final disappearance
of the Mother's power, in a perfect eclipse. At the moment of
greatest darkness the female powers vanish or are conquered by
the Solar powers. 
<p>
The army surrounding the Balkan region
in the vision is a stereotyped Roman legion, surrounding and vanquishing
the darkly-lunar local forces. Rome is solar because of the &quot;twin
sons&quot; myth of Romulus and Remus. The red eagle is not the
alchemical symbol (which is feminine) but the Eagle of the Legions.

<p>
When the Son takes over, the sorrow
of this last phase of the Mother's power is perpetuated, as if
the female powers were &quot;frozen&quot; in that instant of time.
The vision relates this to the conquest of the Middle East by
the Aryans, and the consequences for the women of the area. It
suggests that the invasion was due to the waning of the Mother's
power on a cosmic level, related to the passage of the equinox
from the sign of Taurus into Aries. 
<p>
The entire series of Parts from Opmacas
to Oddiorg can be seen as representing a single complete revolution
of the Moon, passing through all her phases. Opmacas represents
the first instant after the new moon, when the balance between
the Lunar and Solar forces is just barely shifted in her favor.
Oddiorg is the final few instants preceding the new moon. Part
22, Zamfres, is the full moon. 
<p>
The remaining Parts in the sequence
represent the quarters of her orbit. Genadol is the waxing crescent
moon. Aspiaon is the waxing gibbous moon. Todnaon is the waning
gibbous moon, and Pristac is the waning crescent moon. 
<p>
As with any group of four, there is
a temptation to connect these with the elements. But aside from
the clear connection between Pristac and the element of Air, such
an association fails. Zamfres, the full moon, has more in common
with water than any of the remaining four. Perhaps a better way
would be to view the cycle as taking place in a vertical dimension,
with the waxing phases representing a movement into complete manifestation,
and the waning phases a movement back out of manifestation.<br>

Wednesday, August 09, 1995  1:32 PM
<p>
The vision opens with the image of a
minute point in a dark space. No, there is no space, only the
point itself. Now a line begins to extend downwards out of the
point; but before it can extend very far it bifurcates, and splits
again, and again. The angles of the splits are strange in some
way; they seem to defy measurement or definition. A fractal function
of some sort seems to be implied; or something of which a fractal
is a reflection.
<p>
The splitting continues, each branch
of a split extending only a small bit before it splits again.
Soon the whole space (and now there is definitely &quot;space&quot;
present) is filled with them. The original point is totally obscured,
though it seems I can sense a small clear area immediately around
it, hidden by the confusion of lines.
<p>
It seems to me that each of the bifurcations
represents a choice. Rather, the <i>possibility</i> of a choice,
for nothing is really manifest in this vision; these lines all
exist on some level prior to finite manifestation. I don't know
how I know that. Somehow this maze of lines represents the infinite
potential present in the extension of the Point.
<p>
Now the view recedes so that the lines
become smaller. Soon they are entirely lost from view, even though
they still fill the space I am looking at. All that is left is
a featureless something that seems to vibrate intensely with the
possibility of things becoming out of it. All these potentials
seem perfectly balanced; there is no tendency of any sort, in
any direction. 
<p>
The vision continues to recede, and
as I view ever larger amounts of space, another image slowly takes
form. First a pair of crossed lines, intersecting at such an angle
that a rectangle drawn between points equidistant from their intersection
would be a golden rectangle. Now a closed curve appears centered
on their intersection. It is not a circle or an oval, rather as
if a golden rectangle had been distorted towards an oval shape.
The curve turns into a wreath.
<p>
In the center of the wreath a naked
female figure appears. Unlike the Tarot card, there is no scarf
hiding the crotch; it is certain that the figure is not androgynous.
She stands in the pose of Botticelli's Venus. Her right hand rests
between her breasts, pointing upwards; the thumb of her left hand
rests on her mons veneris, the first two fingers pointing downwards,
the others curled under, so that her genitals are framed in the
&quot;V&quot; of her hand. One gets the impression that she is
stimulating herself with her middle finger.
<p>
The voice said: &quot;This is the Virgin
of the World, the third of the powers emanating from the divine.
[That is, the third path, not the third sephira.] She is the complement
to the Will of the Divine, and the Life of the Divine; without
her, nothing would be. And she is greater than they, in a sense,
for she must contain within herself all the possibilities that
they might manifest. And she is less than they, for she serves
them (in the end) with immaculate perfection. 
<p>
&quot;And yet at this point, nothing
is done. She is still pure, unsullied; nothing of her potential
has been made into form. We who dwell in this Part bask in her
unspeakable perfection; we know her, yet she is not touched thereby.
God created her for Love; she is all desire, and the object of
desire unfulfilled. The creatures [i.e., the four elemental animals]
do not encircle her; she encircles them. They come out of her
womb in the moment she becomes known. 
<p>
&quot;Now, if you would understand and
know her, o man who is a mage, then do this: In the dark of the
night, when the world is still, vibrate the Call and the name
of this Part. Assume the god-form she shows here, and invoke her
as you know how, with the pleasure of the body. And if she comes
to you and embraces you, you are indeed among the blessed of Earth;
for only those who are of the highest may know her. And in that
moment will you be willing to give all.
<p>
&quot;Any further voice could be only
silence. We are done.&quot;
<p>
Thursday, August 10, 1995
<p>
I tried the invocation as suggested
but didn't get much from it. A few moments when some force surged
in, but nothing more. Perhaps it was necessary as a conditioning
process, to get my being more accustomed to the power. Will invoke
again the regular way tomorrow.
<p>
Friday, August 11, 1995 12:12 p.m.
<p>
After the invocation, no vision came
immediately. Instead I had a strange sensation in the region of
my heart, as if something were blowing away all tensions -- indeed,
all conditions and qualities of any sort -- and leaving behind
a clean, airy sort of energy. It seemed to well up out of nowhere,
extend up and down my torso and out the five extensions of the
body, blowing out the ends of my fingertips, toes, and the top
of my head. For a moment I felt like one of those diagrams of
the etheric body in the old Theosophical books.
<p>
The power began to blow out through
my skin as well, and the innermost shell of my aura filled with
it, at the same time taking on the form of a vesica piscis around
my body. The sensations from my astral body disappeared, and for
a few moments the vesica was my body, its outline my skin, its
inside a gate opening into a realm where there was nothing but
this power.
<p>
The sense of identification faded enough
for me to hear the voice: &quot;Only those who become her can
know her. Not the mind, not the body, not even the soul and spirit
can know her as she is. If there is any sense of outside, of separation
from her, then she is not known; only in being [emphasized] her
is knowing possible. For she remains virgin throughout all the
ages; the ages are not of her, but are beneath her. [That is,
Time has not yet come into being at this level.] The creations
of man or god touch her not; she is above them, wholly. Now look
again.&quot;
<p>
I fell back into the state (I can't
call it a &quot;vision&quot;) again; barely conscious of time
and sequence. After some time, I saw the image of the Virgin seen
before, but the wreath around her was now a vesica like the one
surrounding me. She seemed far away, then close, then immediately
before me, without any perceptible transition. Her body touched
mine, and I literally melted, starting from the bottom up. In
moments, all of my body below the heart level had vanished entirely;
there was nothing but her and the power out of which she came.
<p>
I didn't find this at all disturbing;
rather, there was a great sense of release. Where the vanished
parts had been, there was nothing but her; it seemed that there
never had been anything but her, and never would be. The vanishing
continued until I was only a head, looking straight into her eyes
from a few inches away. The head vanished and I was a naked viewpoint
under her regard. Then even that difference vanished.
<p>
(This whole process was very sexual,
in a way. It was accompanied by a sensation like what I imagine
one sort of female orgasm to be -- the &quot;wave&quot; or &quot;oceanic&quot;
sort -- save that it was permanently and without effort at the
crest of the wave, a continuous and unending orgasmic peak.)
<p>
Now it seemed that I was her, and she
was a gigantic figure. The vesica that shortly before had been
myself was now her own genitals, glowing in an orgasmic peak.
And out of her the entire world flowed -- no, gushed -- in a great
unending stream. She pours the world out of herself, and this
is the cause of her pleasure. (I am not saying this right, but
it is as close as I can get.) She (I) stands with legs apart,
head back, her spine arched forward, and revels in that pouring-forth.
The eroticism of this is indescribable, and I doubt I will be
able to remember it afterwards; it is too much.
<p>
I cannot call this process &quot;creative&quot;,
in the way that the Father is creative. For there is no focus,
no distinction, no discrimination, no purpose or intent. It is
all the same to her; what comes forth, comes forth, and is as
it should be. But at the same time it is creative, after another
fashion, for there is nothing passive about the process; it is
willed, positive, in no way submissive or receptive. She needs
no Father, no husband or complement; she is self-activated, self-fulfilling.
Her act is her own triumph, not the fulfillment of another's will.
<p>
[A few minutes pass.]
<p>
I passed in and out of that state several
times, each time being out of it for longer. The voice was right;
even this close to the event, I cannot remember it clearly. You
can only <i>be</i> that power in its essence, you cannot view
it from &quot;outside&quot;. I could easily re-enter that state,
but for the moment I choose not to do so. It could be addictive.
<p>
It occurs to me that the last words
the voice spoke in Wednesday's vision is a quite literal prophecy
of today's experience. The words were: &quot;And in that moment
will you be willing to give all.&quot;
<p>
This superficially echoes Liber AL 1:60:
&quot;But to love me is better than all things: if under the night-stars
in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking
me with a pure heart, and the Serpent flame therein, thou shalt
come a little to lie in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou then
be willing to give all;...&quot;.
<p>
In the context of the Liber AL verse,
&quot;willing&quot; is used in the sense of &quot;amenable&quot;,
implying that the magician, having been touched by Nuit, would
want to abandon all that he is and has for more of her. But here
another sense is used -- &quot;active intent in the process of
being carried out&quot;. At the moment of identification, the
Virgin of this vision was will-ing the world out of herself; her
intent was to &quot;give all&quot;. Thus at the moment I became
her, I was literally &quot;willing to give all&quot;. This sort
of cabalistic near-pun is not uncommon with Enochian entities.
<p>
Enough. I dismiss the forces of the
Part.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
Wow.
<p>
With this vision, the Parts return to
their previous pattern of describing themselves in relation to
the Tree of Life. (The seven visions of the Mother seem to take
place outside this pattern.) In this case, the path in question
is that of Saturn, connecting Kether with Binah in Frater Achad's
version of the Tree. Note that this does not accord with the attribute
of the Zodiacal King Lavavoth, which is Sagittarius. Little is
seen of Saturn, either; only the mathematical images in the first
day's vision. The remainder arises exclusively from the Tarot
card.
<p>
The highest aspect of this path is being
presented. It is a complement to the vision of the &quot;Teeth
of the Serpent&quot; seen in Part number seven, Samapha. In order
for the creative aspect of the divine to manifest its power, it
requires a field in which (or on which) to act -- a canvas and
materials with which to work; a stone to sculpt and a space in
which to put it. This Part shows the first breathing-forth of
that complementary aspect from the still point of Kether. It will
not manifest in its stable form until Binah; it is the first movement
towards Binah that is being expressed.
<p>
At its most abstract levels, the space
of our universe seems to be based on irrationals. That is, on
properties that cannot be precisely defined in whole numbers or
as ratios of whole numbers. When the finite mind, the Ruach, tries
to define it, it always eludes the effort; one can come arbitrarily
close, but never quite reaches it. Thus &quot;all their words
are skew-wise.&quot; Pi is such an irrational; the field of fractals
tiling space is another. So is the Golden Ratio. All these can
be demonstrated but not quantified.
<p>
Wednesday's vision shows the formation
of Space as a field of infinite potentials. Pick any point in
the fractal pattern of lines, and it leads to a limitless series
of possible actions. The divine creative force, acting on this
field and choosing its course in accord with its design, brings
about the manifestation of unique occurrences. The potential choices
available in the field are so great that no one creative act --
or indeed, any number of creative acts -- can exhaust them. But
there is no tendency towards one or another type of creation inherent
in the space; its limitless choices are in perfect balance against
each other. And at this point in the process, none of that has
occurred; the field is still coming into being, and is untouched.
<p>
The shape of the wreath is one discovered
by a Swedish mathematician in the 1950's or 60's. A solid figure
with this cross-section has the odd property of being able to
balance on end, even though the end is curved and appears to be
unstable. I don't know if it was actually based on the Golden
Ratio. The vesica piscis is a figure whose two axes express the
Golden Ratio in their proportions. Thus the irrational, elusive
nature of space becomes associated with the Divine Feminine.
<p>
The appearance of the Virgin transforms
all this into a symbolic form, by which the actual power of the
path might become accessible. The speech about her is a distorted
reflection of the actual power, with a bit of short-term prophecy
thrown in for good measure.
<p>
About Friday's vision there is little
more to say. You had to have been there.<br>

At first I could get nothing but a luminous
salmon-pink cloud or haze, very ill-defined. Tried doing the Call
again, and didn't get much more. For a few moment, the circle
turned into a stylized sun, with many triangular rays coming out
of it in three different lengths; perhaps it was a compass rose.
After that, the vision turned into a welter of fragmentary images,
clearly confused and without connection.

Invoked Doanzin again last night. Didn't

doing pranayama while using the name of the Part as a mantra,
and trying to infuse my astral bodies with the energy of the Part.
<p>
I did get the sense that some intervening
magickal influences (i.e., astrological) are influencing my perceptions
in directions incompatible with this Part. Perhaps it would be
best to wait until they pass; but that would be a couple of weeks
from now. Not sure I want to wait that long -- might lose the
momentum for continuing.
<p>
Also got the distinct impression that
this Part will not continue the path-related presentations that
seemed to be starting again with Cralpir. Instead, this Part is
sort of a  introduction or overture to the following three Parts,
with the fourth following them being some sort of coda. Neither
the mundane association (which seemed rich with possibilities)
nor the zodiacal attribute will have much to do with what is seen.

<p>
Odd that musical metaphors come to mind
-- is this significant? I recall when I first looked at the information
for the Part and its mundane association, I kept getting the image
of a lyre or lap-harp. I thought this was just a random mental
association based on the similarity of sounds -- Lydia / lyre.
But maybe there's more to it.
<p>
Another odd impression that came concerned
the Parts as a group. In some dimension they are not really a
series, but rather like the circular queues used in low-level
programming. There is no beginning or end; you can enter at any
point and start reading. The sigils of the Parts are the &quot;addresses&quot;
of bytes in the queue. And while your read-pointer  is at one
position (i.e. the Part you are invoking at the moment) other
&quot;pointers&quot; can be at other addresses in the queue, changing,
modifying, or replacing the &quot;information&quot; stored there.
So by the time you follow the queue around to your starting point,
what you see there might be entirely different than on the previous
pass. I haven't the faintest idea what these &quot;other pointers&quot;
would be, or what would cause them to come into action.<br>

<p>
Friday, August 18, 1995  3:48 PM
<p>
Invoked Doanzin again according to the
usual method.
<p>
It's like there are two entirely different
natures to this Part -- perhaps more. One of those I sense seems
to lead off towards a presentation on creativity or art. The other
leads into a presentation on the &quot;outside&quot; [of the Aethyrs,
and the Earth in general] and how that outside penetrates and
modifies conditions here. I suppose either one of these might
connect with the mundane region; Lydia was known for its culture
and arts, and the country made its living off of trade.
<p>
I feel stuck like Nasrudin's donkey,
between two choices equally interesting. It seems wrong somehow
to choose either one. There must be some point at which these
natures merge. 
<p>
No use; I can't move into either one.
I'll work some more at absorbing and adapting to the Part's power,
and try again another day.
<p>
Friday, August 25, 1995
<p>
I didn't do any more invocations after
the last entry. It became clear that there was a buildup of power
interfering with my ability to get a clear vision, and that the
buildup was increasing in intensity. Seemed best to wait until
it faded before trying again. 
<p>
The interference appears to have been
partly related to the powers invoked in the previous series of
visions, and partly due to astrological events. The astrological
interference reached its peak around 2:00 AM this morning, and
quickly fell off thereafter. Another day or two and I expect it
will be gone. 
<p>
There is some question in my mind whether
the results of the invocations of Doanzin done thus far have any
relation to the actual nature of the Part. It may be that what
was seen was mostly related to the interference, and not to the
thing interfered with. When trying again, will need to be careful
to avoid unconscious expectations based on it.
<p>
Sunday, August 27, 1995  12:38 PM
<p>
The vision opened with an image of the
northwestern Pacific area seen from above. Specifically, of Japan,
the Kurile Islands, and the Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia. There
was a very strong impression of Kamchatka as a place of unrestrained
wildness, and of Japan as a place of unrestrained order, both
arising out of the same underlying force. (All these areas are
volcanically-built lands.)
<p>
Now the image is distorted, twisted
in some way about an invisible center. Kamchatka is pulled downwards
and Japan pulled upwards and both curve around. They become the
Tao symbol, with Japan the Yang and Kamchatka the Yin. Mt. Fuji
becomes the small point of darkness within the Yang, and some
mighty volcano on Kamchatka becomes the small point of light within
the Yin.
<p>
Another image begins to develop overlaying
the Tao. It is the image of a man of Asian features, dressed in
some sort of ceremonial garb. He sits in full lotus position,
hands resting on his knees. He wears a loose black long-sleeved
shirt, a black skirt with vertical silver stripes. A pointed straw
hat (also black) is on his head -- it has a wide brim, like a
coolie hat, with a narrow conical center. Over the shirt he wears
a ceremonial breastplate with shoulder-pieces that flare out horizontally
into points. Upon the center of the breastplate the Tao symbol
is shown, overlaid with a pentagram.
<p>
(The whole image is a nested double
of the numerical series 1-2-5. In the outer series, the invisible
powers of the Earth are One, the peninsula and Japan are Two,
and the Man is Five -- the outline of a pentagram is formed between
his knees, shoulder-pieces, and the top of his hat. In the inner
series, the Man is One, the Tao symbol is two, and the pentagram
symbol is Five.)
<p>
I feel an urge to sit facing this figure,
and do so, assuming the lotus position. A flow of power begins
between us. I sit for some time absorbing it. (I seem to be still
overbalanced on the Yin side at the moment; the forces in the
figure are perfectly balanced against each other, producing stillness.
In myself they are producing a small amount of torsion.)
<p>
It seems that the unrestrained wildness
of Kamchatka (and of the greater Yin) is the unconditioned transfinite
&quot;stuff&quot; of Binah, out of which anything at all might
come; the unrestrained order of Japan (and the greater Yang) is
in some way reflective of Chokmah, the creative force which seeks
to create everything in its own image out of the stuff of Binah.
It is not &quot;Order&quot; as such -- that is, it is not Saturnian.
Rather it is <i>ceremony</i>, a pattern of stylized, dynamic movements
which define the sorts of ordering that take place in the finite
creation. These movements are not themselves Order, but they create
order. In a similar way the stylized ceremonies of traditional
Japan don't necessarily make sense in themselves, but their repetition
by all the people produces a definite social ordering. It is not
quite &quot;unrestrained creativity&quot;, though that is closer
to Chokmah as I understand it.
<p>
Now it seems that the pentagram comes
out of the interaction of the Yin and Yang; their union produces
five children. But these five are not the traditional Elements.
Instead they are the five &quot;planes&quot; of finite manifestation
within which the lower seven sephiroth reside: the Atmic, Buddhic,
Manasic, Astral, and Physical planes. There is a rough correspondence
between these and the Elements, in terms of their &quot;density&quot;:
in order, Spirit, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. But the innate
natures of these planes are not at all elemental.
<p>
The Atmic plane is the finite expression
of Will. But Will cannot be expressed in a single form within
a finite creation; therefor its expression is dual. Geburah represents
the force or power aspect of Will, while Chesed represents its
unifying aspect. These define the nature and purpose of the finite
creation.
<p>
The Buddhic plane is the plane of consciousness,
of awareness. Here the &quot;self&quot; of the creature resides.
It is subordinate to the Will aspect and therefor controlled by
it. Its occasional belief that it is &quot;in control&quot; is
largely an illusion. Its nature is &quot;connection&quot; or &quot;relationship&quot;
or &quot;love&quot; in the divine sense; the conscious being --
under the Will -- reaches out and connects to the rest of the
world, so that that will may be fulfilled. 
<p>
The Manasic plane is the plane of Mind
in the narrow sense. Its manifestations are two: Intellect and
Desire. The first gives order to the sensory experience of the
conscious being. The second gives meaning to that experience.
<p>
The Astral plane is the plane of the
senses and the feelings derived therefrom. Being watery, it reflects
all about it, and so contains the Five and the Two within itself
in small form. (The One is not to be seen here.)
<p>
The Physical plane is what it is. 
<p>
(This stuff about the planes seemed
to come from outside myself, but I did not hear any voice speaking
it.)
<p>
From a transcendental viewpoint, Man
is the Pentagram not because he contains the five elements within
himself, but because he is the only incarnate creature of this
world capable of integrating all five of the finite planes into
a single active whole. The same planes are present in all things,
but in most things the higher planes are inactive. 
<p>
In turn, Man contains the Yin-Yang and
the pentagram within himself in lesser form. Geburah and Chesed
are Yin and Yang, and the lowest five sephiroth are the Pentagram,
following the traditional attributions.
<p>
I sense that I should rest and meditate
upon all this before going on.
<p>
Saturday, September 02, 1995  1:32 PM
<p>
I didn't do any invocations of Doanzin
during the last week. Unlike the previous period, there was no
sense of resistance or of being in the wrong frame of mind to
perceive it. Simply, the time didn't seem right to continue. I
think maybe I am running out of steam for the current series of
visions.
<p>
Invoked Doanzin with the usual procedure.
<p>
The vision opened the same as last Sunday's,
but went through all the movements in a couple of seconds, ending
with the completed figure of the pentagrammatic man inside the
Tao symbol, with another Tao on his breast with a pentagram inside
it.
<p>
Now the man stood up, and the Tao faded
from behind him. He assumed a position reminiscent of the dancers
shown on Hindu temples -- arms and legs in stylized positions,
frozen in mid-movement. His head faced to his left; his left arm
was held across his torso with the palm of the hand raised and
facing to the right. His left leg was also raised, and the calf
and foot almost horizontal to the right. His right arm was raised
so that the upper arm was level, the forearm vertical, the hand
with the palm facing to the left. He held something like a dorje
or a small lightning-bolt in that hand. The right leg held his
weight, and was bent slightly at the knee, towards his left. I
got the impression that the posture represented a swastika with
five arms, whirling rapidly. I don't think a real person could
assume this posture; the image seems to be based on an impossible
perspective.
<p>
A five-armed swastika now appears visibly,
and the man fades from view. The swastika is whirling rapidly
clockwise, throwing off sparks in all directions as it turns.
It is like a whirlpool in some way; it sucks in substance from
the lower planes at its center, and throws that substance out
again in some random direction through its arms. There is a constant
recirculation forming an invisible egg-shape with the swastika
at its top. (Now it seems to me that this figure is at the location
in the Tree called Da'ath, and is rotating in a horizontal plane.)
<p>
Within this egg shape, the image of
a babe appears; much like the ending of <i>2001</i>. The babe
sucks its thumb. It's legs are drawn up; I cannot determine its
sex, if any. 
<p>
This is very difficult; I have been
infected in some way with the whirling of the swastika, and it
is twisting my vision. I have the urge to rest for a while in
a certain posture. 
<p>
I did so, and now my whole visual field
is composed of tiny dots whirling around. 
<p>
At this point I became very dizzy and
disoriented, and stopped the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
This Part has been very difficult to
work with, and I am still not certain that I have seen it's nature
correctly. The last two invocations appear to be internally and
mutually self-consistent, at least. 
<p>
Most of the Parts so far seem to express
qualities of change, dynamic activities within the world, rather
than of specific qualities, energies, or spheres. The &quot;lunar&quot;
series of visions (posted this last summer) might appear an exception
but, as explained in the last comment for that series, they express
one complete cycle of the changes of the Moon. 
<p>
The dynamic events expressed in Doanzin
seem to be a general expression of the way in which the transcendental
spheres produce the finite spheres &quot;below&quot; the &quot;Abyss&quot;,
and the way in which the lower spheres organize themselves and
return to the transcendental state. It is all very abstract.
<p>
The vision of August 27 represents the
&quot;downward&quot; part of the cycle, with the divine unity
dividing itself into male and female aspects, which create the
fivefold &quot;child&quot; that is the finite realm. Kamchatka
belongs to &quot;Mother Russia&quot; -- a punning affirmation
of its &quot;Yin&quot; nature. As well it is a place very little
touched by human beings, in which drastic changes of ecology and
terrain occur on a regular basis. It contains many unique plant
and animal species, thus representing the way in which Binah is
unrestrained by the &quot;status quo&quot; of the lower spheres.
<p>
Japan has its long military and warrior
tradition to make it appropriate as the &quot;male&quot; side
of the Tao. It is intensely -- almost repressively -- organized,
in contrast to Kamchatka. As I said, neither of these qualities
seems appropriate to Chokmah; the explanation given in the vision
seems a bit too flip to be correct.
<p>
I suppose one might instead think of
these two regions in planetary terms, seeing Kamchatka as Uranus
and Japan as Saturn.
<p>
The portions of the vision concerning
the five lower &quot;planes&quot; in the Tree of Life are fairly
standard stuff. But note the emphasis that the conscious self
is not the controlling aspect of the individual nature. This is
worth long consideration.
<p>
The September 2 vision seems to briefly
outline the &quot;return&quot; portion of the cycle. The lower
five become concentrated and unified into a single being (I assume
to be the conscious soul in Tiphereth). This consciousness raises
itself up to the highest level of its finite nature, absorbing
the two spheres of the finite Will into itself in the process
(as represented by the lightning bolt and orb in the hands of
the figure). The conscious self becomes the focus for all the
energetic activity of the being. Finally it produces the &quot;babe
of the Abyss&quot; out of itself, and dissolves into random components
again.
<p>
It was suggested in one of the earlier
visions that this Part is an introduction to the next three Parts,
all of which have names that come from the Black Cross, a.k.a.
the Tablet of Union. In Crowley's model of the Aethyrs, these
three parts would be associated with the so-called &quot;Abyss&quot;,
the region of the Tree bounded by Chesed and Geburah on the lower
side, and by Binah and Chokmah on the upper side. If Crowley is
correct, the symbolism of the last two visions of Doanzin would
seem to be appropriate.<br>

Caspis
<p>
Monday, October 02, 1995  1:11 p.m.
<p>
I am standing at the interface between
sea and sky. Small waves chase across the surface of the sea,
and its depths have the crystal clarity of Caribbean waters, save
that they are tinted purple, not blue. The sky is a brilliant
luminous yellow, and the air it encloses has an even greater clarity
or transparency than the sea; it actually seems to bring things
into a clearer focus than would normally be possible, so that
all sorts of fine details would be visible, were there anything
to look at here.
<p>
Looking into the sea, I see a number
of medusae, small mushroom domes with a fringe of small tentacles.
Their radial structure is visible through their transparent bodies.
They remind me of astrological charts; a small circle in the center,
a larger one as a circumference, radial spokes connecting the
two beneath the domed surface.
<p>
[In passing, I note that deeper in the
water there are fish, who never come to the surface but live their
whole lives in the darker parts of the sea. They don't seem aware
of the surface above them.]
<p>
These medusae seem to be striving upwards
towards the surface, but most run out of energy before getting
there, and fall back into the depths to regenerate and restore
themselves. There is a constant flow of them up and down through
the water. Deeper down, I can see them dissolving into smaller
components in a sort of death; these are not true medusae, but
some sort of colonial organism.  The small component creatures
dash through the water, feeding on something unseen for a while.
Then they get together again and form a new medusa, with a structure
slightly different from their previous form.
<p>
Now my attention becomes focused on
one of them that is coming close to the surface; it strives very
hard, harder with each stroke upwards. There is an asymptotic
effect as it approaches, more effort producing less movement.
It never quite reaches the surface, but when it gets within an
inch or two, the light from above burns it. I can see it shrinking
as it loses mass -- the water is being forced out of it by the
heat, along with a great deal of its substance. In a painful reaction
it everts itself, and something small is released from its center.
<p>
This small thing rises up through the
air-water interface, not as if it were pushing itself upwards,
but rather as if it were attracted magnetically by the realm above.
It rises to a point a few feet above the surface and remains suspended
in the air. It is a tiny sphere with two blade-shaped rays sticking
out of it, somewhat like the shape of the ajna chakra, save that
the rays are oriented vertically.
<p>
Now the rays multiply; first three,
then four, five, six, and so on in a very rapid way. I quickly
lose count; there seems no end to the process. Simultaneously,
the sphere becomes slightly smaller, and transforms into a geometric
shape. In time with the rays, it runs through the classic geometric
solids and into more complex shapes with many facets. All the
time it gets smaller, but the facets remain clear due to the quality
of the air around it. It continues shrinking until it is a geometric
point, but a point that contains within it an endless and evolving
set of aspects.
<p>
I hear a crack of lightning from above,
and the sound of thunder. I sense that some great power has entered
into this realm, and the sounds were the opening of the gate that
it used. Whatever it is, it is invisible; I feel it moving downwards,
filling the air around the tiny star and outwards to a great distance,
but see nothing of it. It encloses the star as a parent might
take a child in its arms, and I seem to hear a voice saying: &quot;This
is my own child, in whom I am well pleased.&quot;
<p>
There is a sense that this power is
in some way hooking itself to the star, putting the star on a
tether, so to speak, so that it cannot be lost or mislaid. And
now the power moves the star back into the water. It is like a
baptism, a blessing. It raises the star, and though nothing different
about it can be seen, there is a sense that it has been tempered
in some way -- &quot;solidified&quot; is the wrong word, perhaps
&quot;confirmed in its innate qualities&quot; would be closer.
<p>
Again and again the star is dipped,
and each time it comes out it is slightly different, while remaining
entirely itself. A voice speaks: &quot;That which comes from the
water must return to it. Not for the continuation of development,
of evolution; rather to clean it of the detritus of its birth
into the higher realm. For when it is once left, the waters of
the great sea become an acid, dissolving that which it once embraced
and fed. And only that which is truly of the higher nature survives
the immersions of the glorious baptism.&quot; [I heard several
different phrases here: &quot;the baptism of power and glory&quot;,
&quot;the baptism of life&quot;, &quot;baptism of the All-highest&quot;,
many others all mixed together.]
<p>
I am not sure how to describe what happens
now. An aura or field of power begins to form around the star.
It is being projected out of the star in some way, and its content
is a reflection of the star's nature, elaborated. But at the same
time the aura is a gate, into a great world possessing those same
qualities. Looking through the edge of it, I can sense something
of that world. It is a hyper-world: that is, it is not restricted
as is our finite world of Earth with its levels and fixed natures;
it exists as an expression of the infinite potential of Binah,
and is never separated therefrom. But at the same time, it exists
in that greater realm of which Binah is merely the local expression.
(I understand what I am seeing, but cannot speak it properly.)
<p>
[A note added later -- it seems to me
now that there wasn't any &quot;gate&quot; into that world; rather,
the world was created in some way through the interaction of the
star with the &quot;stuff&quot; of that higher realm of which
Binah is the reflection.]
<p>
Again the voice speaks: &quot;To the
Master of the Temple, and to the Magus, are all realms opened.
They need not stay within this realm of Earth; their duty to her
is ended, their freedom once again regained. To them are the stars
opened, and all the worlds thereof. To them the infinite reaches
of space become their playground; the stars their toys, jewels
to fix the attention of any child, their motions the motions of
the life they have come to live. 
<p>
&quot;If any deny this, saying: 'there
is nothing beyond nirvana', saying 'there is nothing beyond God',
saying 'the Tao is all', it is only because they are blinded by
the robes of Earth in which they wrap themselves. There is no
end, anywhere. We say it, who stand at the gate. And of all the
angels of the divine, who should know better than we? Our god
says it: there is no end. So it must be. If he should lift you
out of the Earth and give you the stars, would you cling to the
skirts of his robe, or would you step forward to embrace that
which he shows you is a wider world, in which even he is not supreme?

<p>
&quot;There is no dominance in this
wider realm; no rulership of one over another. How can that be,
when every step within it changes it, in ways that no god can
anticipate? All are equal here, save only in the size [ scope?
breadth?] of the changes their movement makes. And when the results
cannot be anticipated, what boots it whether they are large or
small? A movement by a small one might overturn the changes of
a great one as readily as the reverse. 
<p>
&quot;There is no Path in this wider
realm. How can there be, when none knows where it is going? One
creates one's own path, by the very movements that change the
world. And if there should arise on that path that which is not
desired, simply move in another way, another direction. 
<p>
[Note: I got the impression that the
way to prevent these changes from being chaotic is to make one's
movements rhythmic. If the movements repeat in a regular pattern,
so then the changes will take on the same rhythmic quality, and
over time will develop according to what might loosely be called
&quot;themes&quot;.]
<p>
&quot;That is enough, o mage. End this,
and write your comment. We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
From the first instant of this vision,
I had a strong feeling of having been here before, though I can
find no specific instance in the records I still have on-line.
Certainly some of the later section of the vision repeats themes
that have presented themselves before in my work. 
<p>
The astrological attribute of the Part's
King is Pisces, but the quality of the vision connects closely
with the sign of Aquarius, whose path connects Binah with Chokmah
in Achad's Tree of Life. Several elements relate to the sign:
the clear, focusing air is a traditional association. The star
rising into the air is Mercury, the planet exalted in Aquarius.
(The Hebrew name for Mercury, KVKB, literally means &quot;the
star&quot;.) The lightning and thunder-crack of the god's entrance
is Uranus, the ruling planet, which governs all electrical phenomena.
The themes of change and freedom from limitation are also Uranian.
<p>
The sea of this vision encompasses all
of the finite world, as Binah contains all the lower spheres within
itself. The medusae are people of the &quot;adept&quot; grades,
those who are conscious, living souls; they struggle, like the
phototropic medusae, to get closer to the light. The fish in the
deeper waters are those whose lives are wholly concerned with
existence in the &quot;real&quot;, mundane world. With the star,
we have a somewhat soggy representation of the three grades of
Liber AL.
<p>
The &quot;colonial&quot; nature of the
medusae repeats a principle seen previously in these visions:
that the soul is not a unitary or singular entity, but one composed
of many parts in interaction. The &quot;self&quot; is not a constant,
but has a variable nature dependent upon the pattern of those
interactions, and the relative level of activity of the various
components. Change the pattern, and the self changes with it.
<p>
The star that arises from the desiccated
husk of this self is a mystery even to a Master of the Temple.
Its nature is totally elusive; it moves through all things as
if they were vapor, taking on the nature of whatever it is in
contact with. It has permanence of being but no permanent aspect
of any sort. It is the essence of the finite self, but is not
the self. It is identical with God, and it is not god. It may
be the Universal Mercury; I do not know.
<p>
This Part, then, represents the final
movement of that star out of the Abyssal Sea and into the clear
air of the Supernals. This would be in accord with the traditional
association of ZAX with the Abyss, since in an upward movement
(that is, going from TEX to LIL) this would be the last of the
three Parts of ZAX to be encountered. 
<p>
The Part is also an opening into what
has been called, in my earlier work, the &quot;Star-roads&quot;.
Information about this has been fed to me in small dribbles over
the last ten years. A quicker and more complete revelation may
not be possible. This may be because my level of initiation is
not yet high enough, and because understanding it requires a radical
re-orientation from the traditional magickal view of the universe;
a reorientation as drastic as that between the Ptolemaic and Copernican
views of the physical universe. The magickal realms resist such
changes; to bring it into manifestation requires overcoming a
great inertia.
<p>
In any case, the specifics given here
probably aren't important to anyone but a Master of the Temple
or Magus. The one point of general significance is that this view
nullifies Crowley's contention that Magi can only work with Words
that are subordinate to the Word of the Aeon. <br>

<p>
(Note: Neither Turner's version of Liber
Scientiae nor the diagram of the sigils on the Great Table shows
a sigil for the three Parts of ZAX. To maintain the method used
for these visions, I am creating a sigil for Comanan that traces
the exact positions of the characters on the Great Table.)
<p>
Monday, October 30, 1995 11:50 AM
<p>
The vision opened with a view of northern
Europe. The sigil of the Part was imposed thereon.  The vertical
bar going from the corner of the Baltic where Lithuania meets
Prussia, down to near Budapest. The city itself lay just outside
the cut-off corner of the sigil. The horizontal bar went east,
roughly following the course of two rivers (Danube and Donau?)
to the region of Bern. The western border is defined by the sigil
of Gallia.
<p>
Now the area within the sigil shatters
into many irregularly-shaped pieces, each of which turns a different
color. They fly towards me and past me, revealing behind them
a region of endless sky, as if seen through a window, in which
stands a Ram. It seems to me that this ram butted the area from
behind, causing the shattering.
<p>
A voice speaks: &quot;What matter is
man and his works, in the face of God's power? For they are futile
and without gain, and the slightest touch of His Will causes them
to fall into dust. What matter is man, that God should be mindful
of him? Of no matter, and God is not mindful.
<p>
&quot;That which is below is merely
a shadow; if it should be gone in an instant, then what loss?&quot;
<p>
Now the Ram steps forth through the
gap, and begins to trample the surface of the Earth. His hooves
leave marks in the shape of the Part's sigil, and wherever a hoof
stamps, there are the works of man made into naught. All of Europe
is covered with his prints, and then he heads south and east,
trampling through the Holy Lands, and on eastward into the ancient
lands of India. As he moves he seems to sense something, and his
course begins to bend towards a specific goal, lying somewhere
in central India.
<p>
My viewpoint comes closer to the Earth,
and races along the projected path of the Ram. I pass along a
great plain lying hot under the equatorial sun. Over the horizon
there rises a tower, very phallic, a giant lingam of polished,
light-colored stone. About its head there is a halo or aura of
power. It is neither a creative nor a destructive power, but simply
Power, without object and complete in itself. It does not radiate
or extend itself, it simply <i>is</i>, and all about it seems
to become less real by comparison with it. (I hear voices in the
background chanting the name of Shiva, and feel a sense of anticipation
in the air, an electric stillness like that preceding a thunderstorm,
but much more intense.)
<p>
The chanting becomes more -- frantic?
no, enthusiastic -- and I am compelled to join it. The name Shiva
arises out of me unbidden, an unconditional, uncaring joy arising
with it. In a few moments I feel wonderfully exalted. While the
chanting increased in force, the power the was formerly around
the head of the tower covers a greater area, until a large sphere
around the tower is filled with it.
<p>
The ram now charges over the horizon
from the northwest, making straight for the tower. He has become
smaller, no longer of a size to trample a continent, but has lost
none of his force. He races forward, and as he reaches the edge
of the circle, he makes a great leap upwards. He flies towards
the cap of the tower, head lowered as if to butt it. His head
touches the tower, and suddenly -- nothing. Everything has disappeared
save for the sense of Power. It seems as if, in an instant too
short to notice, the entire world -- the entire universe -- had
shattered into its ultimate components and vanished. Nothing is
left but the brilliance of the Power of Shiva.
<p>
(My own astral body has also vanished;
I seem to be nothing but a naked viewpoint.)
<p>
Time has stopped; space has stopped.

<p>
After a timeless time, which could as
easily have been aeons long as moments, I seem to be hovering
in some hyper-realm, outside the circle of Shiva. Colored wisps
are slowly fading into the darkness around it, like the dispersing
smoke of an explosion.
<p>
Nothing is happening; I wait.
<p>
The wisps finally disperse completely.

<p>
After waiting a while longer, I decide
to re-enter the sphere. I do so.
<p>
Discord! I am immediately assaulted
by a thousand different sounds and images. The air is filled with
screeching, out-of-tune noises, like the world's worst amateur
orchestras, each player out of synch with all the others, each
orchestra playing a different melody, each competing to overwhelm
the others by sheer volume.
<p>
The area is also filled with cacodemons,
each zipping about along a different path. They collide frequently
and continue on their way. If they could be said to be going anywhere;
their movements seem entirely random. Each carries a little fragment
of an image in his hands, like a jigsaw-puzzle piece. 
<p>
Where is the overwhelming Power that
was here before? All that seems to be left is fragments, shells,
detritus. 
<p>
Now it seems that some sort of ordering
power has come back into the region. I cannot detect it directly,
but the sounds are coming into harmony with one another, taking
up the same rhythm. As each sound falls into perfect synchronization,
it is subsumed into a general note or chord. 
<p>
Similarly, the movements of the cacodemons
are becoming more regular, and they are drawing away from me.
They begin to array themselves in offset rows, so that the feet
of one are between the heads of the two in the row below. They
tile the entire surface of the sphere like the demons and angels
in an Escher print. Now each one holds up its fragment of an image
before it; the fragments merge into one another, and suddenly
the world is whole again. I am back on the plain before the tower
of Shiva.
<p>
The voice says: &quot;When the spark
of will in the Son meets the Power from whence it came, then the
world it created for itself is utterly destroyed. All order is
lost, all coherence vanishes. The spark withdraws into its God,
leaving behind only fragments of its shells. These have no tendency
to unity left in them; it resides entirely within the spark.
<p>
&quot;And since that which is a Man
is such a shell, it also is destroyed when it's spark reunites
with its God.
<p>
&quot;And yet, such a union is not always
permanent, or it seems not so. Something comes forth again from
the divine, something which partakes of the nature of that former
spark, while not itself like unto a spark. Are they the same?
One cannot say. For in God are all things become naught; the discontinuity
defies all attempts to unite the Before with the Afterwards. One
only knows that the shattered world is reformed, though not unchanged.
<p>
&quot;We who dwell in this Part serve
only in the re-uniting of the God with its Son; our task ends
when the world is destroyed. That which comes after is the work
of something beyond our ken. 
<p>
&quot;There is naught else to say. We
are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
The body of this vision seems to have
less to do with the mundane region than some of the others we
have seen. Yet there seem to be some minor connections. I recall
that Alice Bailey once said that the personality of Germany (as
distinct from its &quot;soul&quot;) was governed by the Ray of
Will. And both Germany and Poland have suffered from the fragmentation
shown here at various times in their history. 
<p>
This was particularly the case in medieval
Poland, where the custom of primogeniture did not hold sway, and
the sons of a noble divided his land among themselves. The consequence
was that the &quot;states&quot; became smaller and more numerous
with every generation. And since what passed for the Polish government
of the time required unanimous consent among the nobles, nothing
ever got done at the national level. One might liken the Polish
state, without a powerful king to focus the national will, to
the conditions described here.
<p>
The remainder of the vision is fairly
clear. Alpudus is attributed to Aries in the system used for these
visions; combined with the power derived from Comanan itself (as
part of the Black Cross) it produces a vignette on the divine
and personal wills.
<p>
One might take the opening portion of
the vision to represent the personal will as it acts when not
under divine guidance; it more or less stumbles around, destroying
as much as it creates, without any long-term benefit. Having sensed
the divine, its movements become more purposeful and directed;
it concentrates itself (as it gets smaller in the vision) and
focuses on attaining contact with its divine origin. (The hoofprints
of this beast are, amusingly, reminiscent of the &quot;footprints
of the Camel&quot; in Crowley's visions.) Finally it unites with
its divine counterpart; the Eye of Shiva is opened, and the world
is destroyed. <br>

<p>
Wednesday, November 08, 1995  2:16 PM
<p>
The vision opened with an image of southeast
Asia and Australia. My attention was drawn to the great sweep
of islands lying between them, from Malaysia onwards into the
east in a more or less horizontal line. The Philippines were not
included. Like the Japan/Kamchatka region of an earlier vision,
I got the impression that these were all connected by a single
crack in the Earth's crust, and that they were all linked at a
hidden level.
<p>
Now the image swooped in on one of the
larger islands. (I sense that it doesn't matter which island,
they are all the same. But it seems to be either Borneo or New
Guinea.) It comes down until I can see the central mountains of
the island, and further until I can see a great valley between
the mountains. 
<p>
I see a village there. Huts of various
shapes, some round, some long, some simple, others rather elaborate.
In one of the larger buildings, the men of the village are plotting
a raid; each is dressed in his ceremonial paint and headdress;
each has a loincloth on, with one of those weird penile sheaths
attached to the outside, like a primitive codpiece. They have
wide leather straps around their upper arms and their thighs,
to which small pieces of feathers are attached to make colorful
designs. Each sits with a spear at his side. 
<p>
One of the men holds a spherical gourd
about six inches across. A hole has been cut in one side, and
he sticks his mouth into it. I cannot see what he is doing --
is he trying to lap up something from inside it? Or inhaling something?
He pushes his mouth against the gourd with great force for a while,
moving his head around. Then suddenly he pulls the gourd away,
and leans his head back with a great shout.
<p>
The other men shout as well, and pound
their hands on the ground in rhythm. Their shout becomes a loud
chant in time with the pounding. The first man is shaking, his
eyes rolled up; he sways and spasms, his arms flying about. He
begins to babble. I cannot understand the words that any of them
say, but his speaking seems to be different, a speaking in tongues.
His voice rises higher and higher in pitch, until it is near a
scream. 
<p>
Suddenly his voice is a scream; his
spasming ceases to be random, and becomes evidence of some great
pain. Now parts of his body begin to falls off; it sheds little
pieces of flesh and bone with every movement. The other men are
alarmed and move backwards, leaving a wide space around him. Even
as he falls apart the man shakes even more, until he is shaken
into a low pile of fragments, which continues to quiver. Still
quivering, the pile liquefies and flows down out of sight through
the cracks in the floor. The other men are silent, and go out
of the hut, dispersing to their homes in the village.
<p>
The image freezes, and a voice comes:
<p>
&quot;When men seek to know what lies
beyond their world, when they try to divine the consequences of
movement into the god-worlds, then the prophecy is always the
same: Death and Destruction! The gods are jealous of their realm,
and would let no man enter therein; the attempt brings death now,
or death later, but death nonetheless. (There is a second sense
to &quot;no man&quot;; i.e. they would let Nemo enter.)
<p>
&quot;And if one fears, as these do,
then truly is the death a real one, with nothing left over. But
if one fears not, and advances, then is the world made new, and
all things become the divine without ever changing what they are.

<p>
&quot;Fear is the killer; Fear takes
that which is man and makes it nothing, less than dust. Where
Fear is, the spirit is not. 
<p>
&quot;Cast aside fear, o you men and
women, cast it aside, we say! Or turn your violence upon it, destroy
the destroyer, kill that which would kill you. Then kill your
violence in turn.
<p>
&quot;If one is empty of fear, then
the death of the spirit is nothing, a moment's disturbance in
the continuation of being; that which arises from it is not human,
but it contains the human within it. Nothing is lost.
<p>
&quot;If we were to continue the vision
at this time, then we would show you that fear truly rules in
this land. [i.e., the earthly regions governed by Tabitom] But
you comprehend it in essence, though the vast extent of their
Fear is beyond your comprehension. You may remark upon it yourself
for those who read.
<p>
&quot;But it were best to wait and come
again to this place, and see what occurs on a different level
of existence. Then you will have a clearer picture of Tabitom
as it is.&quot;
<p>
I decided to end the vision, thanked
them, and stopped.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
The more primitive cultures in the region
shown are among the most paranoid on Earth, thus their association
with fear. It is believed that no one dies a &quot;natural&quot;
death; every death is the work of some sorcerer, which must be
avenged before the spirit of the deceased can find rest. Usually
some member of a nearby tribe is determined to be the sorcerer,
and the required revenge becomes an excuse for a raid. The other
tribe feels the same way, of course, so both tribes exists in
a state of perpetual low-level war.
<p>
The mythologies of the region are filled
with malevolent gods and evil beings of various sorts, all of
them out to destroy the individual. Among these is the &quot;man-ripe-making-snake&quot;,
whose bite turns its victim into a puddle of goo, like the shaman
in the vision. 
<p>
These tribesmen seeking an augury are
linked to those who look at the transition from the normal human
levels of the Tree of Life to the transcendental levels. As the
tribesmen live in fear of death, so do those who think of the
so-called &quot;Abyss&quot; as a terrible experience. In either
case, the fear becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<p>
I was considering doing this vision
a couple of nights earlier, but decided instead to work on a short
introduction to the 91 Parts Working. It seems that perhaps a
bit of the Part came through despite my change of intent, since
the introduction I wrote began with a couple of paragraphs about
fear in magick:
<p>
The price of initiation is to be ceaselessly
surprised; to live in a world where the only certainty is that
what you believe to be Truth, believe to be real, even what you
believe to be yourself will be changed in ways that you cannot
anticipate. No matter how great our knowledge and experience,
it is always surrounded by the infinite darkness of the unknown;
and out of that darkness things can come at any moment to transform
our world.
<p>
One must advance towards the darkness
without fear. Not because there is nothing to fear; rather because
fear forces the unknown into its own ugly shape, a shape that
we all know too well. Nothing truly new can come into our consciousness
while fear dominates. Deny fear its power, deny it any right to
control you, and the magickal universe becomes a place of endlessly
unfolding wonders. Embrace the unknown and it will reward you
by opening up its unspeakable, astonishing variety.
<p>
Thursday, November 09, 1995  3:26 PM
<p>
The vision opens with the image of a
man in the blue robes of an Exempt Adept. He is seated on the
cubical stone; his elbows are on his knees, and he holds the sides
of his head in his hands, as if he were in pain. The sides of
the cube show the glyphs of the planets, excepting Sol, which
is in the center. The glyphs are in bas-relief, and are surrounded
by highly elaborate images related to the planet in question;
I sense the intent is to show that these powers are fully developed
and under the Adept's control.
<p>
Now I can see into the man's head, and
it seems that it is divided into several small chambers; each
chamber has within it the image of a smaller man or woman. These
reach out their arms and grasp the hands of the ones in adjacent
chambers. (It seems they can touch each other, though they cannot
move outside their individual cells.) They try to pull themselves
closer to each other, to come together in the middle of the man's
head, where the sahasrara chakra has its root. They strain together,
coming closer to the center, but as they do the power of the divine
flowing in through the chakra repels them with increasing force,
as does the wall of each one's cell.
<p>
They strain ever harder to come together,
but suddenly each loses its grip on the others, and they are thrown
back into the far corners of their respective chambers. Now they
are all dizzy and infuriated; they shout at each other and at
the pillar of power that is the root of sahasrara. They are all
very agitated; they bounce randomly around their chambers, causing
the walls to bend when they hit. The man grips his head tighter
and moans with despair. It seems that he would kill himself if
he could, but that would require more coordination of those compartmented
beings in his mind than he can muster. So he sits and suffers
helplessly.
<p>
This whole cycle repeats itself several
times.
<p>
Now the voice says: &quot;Can that which
is divided into many parts become that which is single and without
distinctions? No; it is not to be. The many shall ever be many;
the one (which is None) will not have them.
<p>
&quot;How then might a man -- who is
a thing of many parts -- become One? That which is the man cannot;
he is a thing of the finite worlds, each of his parts distinct
and qualified. But there is that in him which is already of the
divine. Being already united (and even &quot;united&quot; is a
false distinction) it has no need to become One, but merely to
make itself known and to take the consciousness into itself.
<p>
&quot;But the consciousness is bound
into those many parts, which it thinks to be itself. (Though it
is not so.) It must become un-bound; it must unravel the skeins
it has built around itself, or have them unraveled by a higher
power. And what is the loosening of the bindings of Self but the
death of the Self?&quot;
<p>
Now in the image the pressure from the
column of the Sahasrara becomes ever greater, forcing the various
small beings in the man's head out and away from itself. They
are pushed back into the far corners of their compartments. Still
it increases, and there comes into it a noticeable vibration,
which shakes everything it touches intensely.
<p>
The little beings are so shaken; and
like the shaman of the previous vision, they are shaken into pieces,
then into a sludge. Finally this sludge is shaken so intensely
that it becomes gaseous, losing all form whatsoever it had. The
gases (all colored differently) expand and fill the various chambers,
and simultaneously cease to be affected by the power of the chakra.
That power now radiates without hindrance through the head of
the man. The man looks greatly relieved and almost happy.
<p>
&quot;Only when the distinctions are
destroyed can the divine shine through. That which remains of
the parts of the man are no longer distinct, save for the faint
coloring each supplies as the light of the divine shines through
it. But this is not the end; look again.&quot;
<p>
I look at the man, and see that the
sahasrara is now fully active and illuminated. Its edge expands
and curls down until the man's entire head is enclosed within
it. The flow of its force is a sphere turning on itself, sweeping
clockwise and counter-, inwards and outwards, all at the same
time. 
<p>
This sweeping motion seems to have some
effect on the gases. They do not recondense, but within them there
appears an image (and it is only an image) of what was there before;
each part's little being can be seen, but overshadowed and made
transparent to the force of the divine. They no longer attach
to each other, but the power of the divine somehow allows communication
between these images in a reflection of their previous activity.
<p>
The man stands up and turns to look
at the cube on which he sat. He smiles and shakes his head. He
goes out of the image for a moment and returns pushing a comfortable-looking
padded chair or small couch, which he places behind the cube.
He goes out again, returns with a can of Pepsi-Cola and a bag
of potato chips. He sits in the chair and pops open the can; he
opens the bag and sets it on the cube. Then he leans back, puts
his feet up on the cube, and relaxes, eating and drinking at leisure.
<p>
I sense that the voice begins to say
something else, then decides it unneeded. It indicates without
speaking that there is no more to see or hear for now, so I end
the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
Up to the Exempt Adept grade, the path
of initiation (follow cabalistic methods) is one of  building
connections between things; between the parts of the mind; between
various things in the contents of the mind; between the mind and
the &quot;external&quot; magickal universe. The magician builds
meta-connections on top of connections, traveling up through layers
of greater and greater inclusivity until the almost the entire
being is melded into the experience of a small number of archetypes
and related &quot;pure&quot; energies. The accompanying initiations
are grand experiences, so much so that they pass beyond superlatives.
The cubical stone of the vision is the structure he has built
through this work.
<p>
But these archetypes, while definitely
of a very high level, are still finite in some sense; they are
conditioned, they have definite perceptible qualities even if
they do not have a perceptible form. There is a limit to their
possible mergings; at some point one reaches an irreducible minimum
of them necessary to describe the magician and his perceived reality,
and that minimum number is always greater than One, just as the
cube has more than one face. 
<p>
The momentum of the magician's work
all pushes towards achieving an impossible union between these
archetypal elements. All the force he has tries to push them together,
while their distinct natures exert an equal force against it.
Like the little beings inside the man's head, they can relate
and interact with each other, but cannot become other than what
they are. 
<p>
The Adept of the vision reflects the
problems of the human who is approaching the so-called &quot;Abyss&quot;.
He finds that he reaches a point where all his straining will
not take him permanently to a higher level; no matter how hard
he pushes, he always falls back to his previous condition afterwards.
And the rebound from his efforts often puts him into a state of
temporary mental disorganization, where the bindings between his
archetypal elements are stretched in equal proportion to the effort
he had exerted.
<p>
This stretching is actually of benefit,
though it is a hideously unpleasant experience. The very unpleasantness
encourages the transcendental spark within the finite being to
cease its lifelong habit of identification with that person. Even
though that spark is still not aware of its transcendent nature,
it begins to perceive the finite being as a hindrance. Gradually
it reaches a state of negativity or rejection with respect to
the personal Self, and this rejective force starts a breakdown
in the skein of connections he has made over the years, releasing
the energy bound in it into a diffuse state. (In the vision, this
corresponds to the expansion of the sahasrara and its shaking-to-pieces
of the beings in the man's head.)
<p>
As a consequence of all this, the great
structure the adept has built through his work becomes just another
object-among-objects in the world of his finite perceptions. The
excitement of building it leaves him, as do the glorious experiences
he had in the process. Life becomes plain and prosaic again for
a time, and all he can do is wait until the moment is right for
the final movement into the transcendental levels. This is represented
by the last image of the vision, where the cubical stone becomes
a mere coffee-table for his snack. <br>

<p>
Examining the three Parts for the Aethyr
ZAX, it is apparent that they confirm a relationship between this
Aethyr and the transition between the finite and transcendental
realms. But considered in the overall sequence of Parts, Crowley's
correspondences between the Aethyrs and the sephiroth are not
confirmed. We have already descended to Tiphereth via several
paths before encountering these three. 
<p>
Each of them looks at the same process,
but with the emphasis upon a different aspect in each. Since the
Parts appear to be going in a sequence from top to bottom of the
Tree of Life, the most transcendental of the three was seen first,
and the most finite last. Note that in the vision of Lexarph,
the dominant theme is that of Aquarius, the horizontal path that
lies immediately above the &quot;Abyss&quot; in Frater Achad's
Tree of Life. In the vision of Tabitom, there are several references
to Death, Scorpio, the horizontal path that lies immediately below
it. The vision of Comanan, with its references to Shiva, relates
to the path of Fire, which connects Kether and Tiphereth, and
crosses both of the other two paths. 
<p>
Note also that the &quot;official&quot;
attributes of the Parts reverse the order of the dominant attributes
in the visions. Where the latter go in the sequence Air, Fire,
Water, the former go in the sequence Water, Fire, Air. One might
speculate that the element of Earth is also present, but concealed,
since the double cross formed by the paths on the Tree is the
same cross seen on the staff of the Heirophant, the card of Taurus.
<p>
The submerged medusae of the first vision
correspond to the Adept of the last; the transition between water
and air in the first vision corresponds to the second vision.
Tracing additional connections, it seems that the Tower of Shiva
in Comanan becomes the pillar that is the root of the sahasrara
chakra in Tabitom. The frantic chanting in Comanan might become
the shaking vibration of the Tabitom vision. Each of the visions
contains parts of the others.

<p>
Saturday, November 11, 1995  7:47 p.m.
<p>
(I note that today is exactly ten years
from the start of the Earthworks project, which was the beginning
of my maturity as a magician, and of my significant Enochian works.)
<p>
Difficulty getting the invocation started
today. Every time I formulated the intent to do it, someone or
something would interrupt. The last interruption was a cat who
jumped up in my lap and put his face directly in front of mine,
staring intently, while I was vibrating the Call of the Aethyrs.
I ignored him and continued; he lost interest as soon as I completed
the Call, and left the room quickly. 
<p>
The vision opened with the image of
a rayed sun; in front of the sun stands a god or angel in white
robes, with his arms spread in benediction. In front of him is
a small shield with a circle engraved upon it. No, I am wrong,
the shield and the sun are actually the Enochian sigil of Fire,
with the central two circles pulled forward so that the being
can stand between. But it is all in gold and silver, not in the
colors the G.D. uses.
<p>
Beneath the sigil and directly beneath
the hands of the being are two pillars, both white. One (under
the being's right hand) is topped with a sun, with twelve triangular
rays; the other (under the being's left hand) is topped with a
crescent moon, surrounded by thirteen rays, but with the points
directed inwards.
<p>
I get a couple of quick impressions
at this point. First, that the two pillars are the columns of
the Tree. Second, that the horizontal bars in the sigil of the
part are the horizontal paths of the Tree. Third, that the three
pairs of letters in the god-names of Six letter (in the Lesser
Angles of the Tablets) are equivalent to the pairs of sephiroth
at the ends of the horizontal paths. (This last does not feel
like a non sequitur, but I do not grasp the significance of it.)
<p>
I vibrate the name of the Part again,
and the sigil of the Part appears imposed on the pillars, like
the path of the Lightning Flash. [The implication is of the Flash,
even though it is reversed with respect to the usual form.] Now
the sigil seems to move, and become a series of waves passing
through the channel between the pillars as if they were a wave
guide. At the bottom of the pillars the waves spread out and towards
me, becoming a series of circular waves as on the surface of a
still pond. The image of the pillars and angel is distorted and
then hidden by these waves, as would be an image reflected in
water.
<p>
The circular waves pass beyond my sight
in every direction, with new ones continually replacing them.
<p>
Now a new set of circular waves enter
in from the four diagonal corners of the field of view, as if
the original wave has been reflected by some surfaces out of sight.
These waves interact with the outgoing waves to produce an interference
pattern. The pattern is four rectangular arrays of diamond-shaped
high-points in the water, separated by vertical and horizontal
lines passing through the origin of the outgoing waves. These
lines seem to be areas where the interacting waves cancel each
other out.
<p>
The positions of the points seem fairly
stable, though the continual movement of the water lends them
a shimmering quality. And now a new overlay comes in, and each
point is surrounded by a square; all the squares join to their
neighbors, and they become the four tablets of the Great Table.

<p>
The points of water suddenly become
like little flames, each enclosed in its square. A little flame
of divine power, I think. The receptiveness of Water has become
a positive upward striving, fiery in nature. Each of the flames
is a prayer to God; and the four Tablets are in themselves an
invocation of the highest God of the Enochian universe.
<p>
Now the original image becomes visible
again behind the Tablets. Its influence had never truly departed,
just been concealed for a time. The force moving between the pillars
provides a vertical organizing influence, so that the tops of
the arrays of squares (as viewed from my POV) become &quot;up&quot;
rather than all squares being on an equal level. And the flames
become organized into the Names written on the Tablets, with their
hierarchies and functions. 
<p>
The upward striving of the prayers that
are the Tablets produce a response from the angel (which I now
perceive to be an image of the Enochian God). But where the original
impulse moving downwards was fiery, this response is watery, like
a blessing with holy water. 
<p>
And a voice says: &quot;How can God
not respond, when that which calls is Himself? How can He ignore
the prayers of the little flames, when each flame is the expression
of His own desire? 
<p>
&quot;God has extended himself into
the world, and created therein a continual flow of himself, going
from the lowest to the highest levels of existence. He puts forth
his power, and the Tablets are created in response; the Tablets
put forth their enflamed hearts in prayer, and He responds by
lifting them up. So it ever has been, from the moment of our creation;
so will it ever be, until Time stops and the worlds are again
withdrawn fully into himself.
<p>
&quot;And why has God done this? So
that man might have the means of rising to meet him. For where
God is not directly touchable by man, yet these little flames
(which are equally God) are accessible to all, be they even of
the lowest. And in the voices of the Calls can man attach himself
to those flames, and make them a part of himself; and thereby
is he made to be God in part, rising, like all the flames of the
Tablets, up unto God in his heaven. 
<p>
&quot;And yet, you think, is it not
said: 'it repenteth me I made man'? But think again: does not
repentance require contrition, that is, the will to make right
what was ill-done? And so it is; for God, in his expulsion of
man from his high estate, did great ill; towards a good end (as
you know) but it brought evil and pain upon humankind which was
not deserved. And so god, in contrition for his acts, has freely
given unto man that which will bring him back to his estate. 
<p>
&quot;And also has he sent his angels
unto those who could bring his act to the attention of men, in
their time. And sent others to use his creation as it should be
used, that the secret minds of men might sense its purpose and
become attracted, each in their own time. 
<p>
&quot;Let those be lifted up, who were
thrown down; let those be made whole who were split into many
parts; let those be given life who were dead to the spirit; and
let those who have lived in hell be given heaven. When and as
they chose it, and not as God wills. [This emphasized.]
<p>
&quot;For He forced man into his scheme,
and true contrition, true remedy of his acts, thus requires the
abdication of force. He must give freely where he once took; he
must place each in their desired places, where once he gave no
heed to desire. He must give choice, where once there was no choice
given. And his act of contrition must continue until every man,
both male and female, has transcended the consequences of His
acts. 
<p>
&quot;And what of you, o man, who is
also a mage, and something like unto a small god? We see in your
mind the glimmerings of some understanding, but not all; therefore
let us make it clear. 
<p>
&quot;It is true that you were the instrument
of the Fall that God engineered, the seed (let us say) upon which
the manifestation of humanity was formed. [The implication is
of &quot;seed crystals&quot;, not of plant seeds.] Therefor, you
think, you might also require some act of contrition in this regard.
Yet it is not so, for when you caused men to fall, did you also
fall with them, and take upon yourself the same burdens as they;
forgetting your high estate, forgetting your rightful place among
the stars (save for that unending, unquenchable longing). You
have lived as a man, suffered as a man, even though this was not
necessary to the accomplishment of the task. And thereby have
you mitigated any ill that you might have done.
<p>
&quot;Why then, you think, does your
magickal oath -- the only oath you have ever taken with the full
force of your being -- in so many ways reflect the requirements
of God's contrition? It is simply said: you are one of us. Like
we who were created by God, you (who were not so created) have
accepted the joy of Being in and with God. We give as God wills,
because we were made so; you give as God gives because you love
God, and do his work. And if God desires to give freely and without
restriction unto man, in mitigation of his acts, why then, so
do you do. What more reason need there be?
<p>
&quot;Now we have said enough for now.
Rest you, and think upon what is said. And in the light of day,
continue with this sphere, this Part, and see what more is to
be seen. Our blessings and love upon you, our brother and lover,
and go well. We are done.&quot;
<p>
I ended this vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
I don't know whether this vision expresses
the actual content of the Part, or is simply a commemoration of
the anniversary mentioned. Since I got flashes of the opening
image the preceding day, during preparations, it might possibly
be the former, but with the content tailored somewhat to the day.
Another session with this Part will tell.
<p>
The revisionist myth of the Fall, and
my supposed part in it, are described in detail in _The Book of
the Seniors_, a series of visions from the Earthworks project.
This present vision links the Enochian system into that myth directly
for the first time.
<p>
The idea that God might make mistakes,
or at least suffer the pangs of conscience, is rather radical
from a standard religious point of view. But it is perfectly consistent
with the views expressed in my Enochian work over the last ten
years. There is no &quot;absolute&quot; God, no &quot;ultimate&quot;
creator. There are only local gods, though &quot;local&quot; is
an elastic term; it might include a portion of a single world,
or an entire galaxy. 
<p>
For a variety of reasons, gods in the
Enochian view are neither omniscient nor omnipotent. The most
important of these reasons is that the creations of different
beings interact with each other, producing results that are not
predictable by any being. In an environment of multiple creators,
the unexpected is to be expected; surprise lurks for every being,
no matter how evolved. The intrinsic unpredictability at the roots
of matter adds yet another dimension of surprise. 
<p>
One can imagine that the actual results
of an act of creation, including unexpected aspects, might show
a creator a better way that it could have been done in the first
place. Or that, having taken action to stop the effects of some
error, a creator might want to change his mode of action to get
on with the desired course of things. Either one of these might
apply to the God depicted by the ministers of Molpand.
<p>
Or they might not. In any case, it seems
that the Enochian magick has been provided as the spiritual equivalent
of a public elevator, useable by anyone with a minimum of skill
and proper intent. My experience and observation confirms that
this is true in practice. Even those who use the system with the
most puerile of motives find themselves changed by it, and pulled
into the path of initiation if they have any tendency at all in
that direction. 
<p>
My experience also confirms that there
are no conditions of any sort attached to this magick. It is a
great and valuable gift, given freely and without expectation
of return. There is no quid pro quo; one need not worship (or
even believe in) its god to gain its benefits, nor conform one's
thoughts and actions to any particular course. The only price
is that one is transformed by it, in accord with one's own nature.
That nature is brought closer to its perfection, slowly made more
divine over time. 
<p>
Tuesday, November 14, 1995  1:35 PM
<p>
The vision opened with a view of northern
Anatolia, centered upon the peninsula that points northwest towards
Constantinople. Now the sigil of the Part is overlaid on the peninsula,
distorted to fit. Its topmost point is at the crossing between
Asia and Europe; it's lowest crossbar at the base of the peninsula.
<p>
The view moves in towards the great
city; I see it from above, and in the center is the beautiful
temple, Hagia Sophia.
<p>
[Interrupted once again at this point,
by a delivery truck with new kitchen furniture. An hour later,
I get back to the vision...]
<p>
This is the pre-Islamic version of the
Temple, without the four minarets. It may even be the original;
the dome seems lower than I remember it. But there are four buildings
in a square around it, at some distance. Each of these seems in
some way to be a manifestation of one of the elements, or one
of the four directions. (I suspect they never existed in reality;
I don't recall anything of the sort.)
<p>
There is a sub-vision saying that this
image also relates in some way to my Enochian Temples. Not to
the basic temples, but to the meta-temple that sometimes forms
when the magickal charge is particularly intense. This meta-temple
is also &quot;hagia sophia&quot; -- &quot;divine wisdom&quot;
in manifestation. In fact, the form of the meta-temple is almost
exactly that of Sophia; roof domed instead of the conical form
of the regular temples, vaulted entrances, large open interior
space, etc. The four smaller buildings might be representations
of the regular temples surrounding the meta-temple.
<p>
[See the visions in <i>The Lotus of
the Temple</i> for one appearance of the meta-temple. See <i>Enochian
Temples</i> for a description of the temples of the Tablets.]
<p>
Now the view backs up into the sky again,
and it seems that the Sophia is glowing with some inner power.
It radiates, but is constrained by the bounds of the peninsula
on which Istanbul stands, in the east and west. On the north some
other power presses down, again constraining it. So the power
flows south, crossing over the straight and into Anatolia. 
<p>
The power flows down the peninsula,
and when it reaches the base, it spreads out in a semicircle,
covering the area between the seas and Ankara. This area remains
filled with power, but now it flows outwards in circular waves,
just as in the previous vision. 
<p>
To the northwest, the wave strikes something,
and the response is the precipitation of a multitude of documents;
reams of papers falling through the air and littering the countryside.
To the southwest, it strikes the communities of northern Africa;
some of these build walls around themselves, and become silent.
To the northeast, it strikes many communities, and these become
centers of radiation themselves, putting out their own circular
waves. And in the southeast, a great flame springs up, and washes
over the face of the Earth.
<p>
(I get the impression that all this
is some obscure cabalistic pun or joke, true in its own way, but
put forth in a mood of fun. Now it becomes clear. The Europeans
reacted to Byzantine Christianity intellectually, producing tons
of theology to show that their own Roman version was the True
Church. The peoples of northern Africa reacted by producing monastic
communities, wherein weird combinations of Christianity and local
faiths were practiced. The Russians and eastern Europeans got
into the spirit of the thing, trying to become more Byzantine
than the Byzantines. And the Arabs reacted by producing Islam.
These all correspond to the four Tablets in the revised Great
Table. )
<p>
This isn't getting anywhere. The interruption
threw me off stride. I need to stop for a while and regroup before
continuing.
<p>
8:23 PM
<p>
The vision opens as if a veil was torn
in two, and with it was ripped away the &quot;space&quot; in which
my circle was formed. Now that circle hangs in the air like something
out of a Dr. Strange comic book; I am still standing on it, but
simultaneously see it from above and behind. In front of the circle,
huge in comparison, lies the meta-temple spoken of earlier. It
is composed of energy, pearlescent and allochroous, but with every
edge outlined in black. On each face of the Temple, a pointed
vault like the upper half of a Vesica Piscis marks an entrance.
<p>
There is a definite sense of &quot;reaching
upwards&quot;, of invocation in the fabric of this temple, like
the prayer-flames seen before, but multiplied ten thousandfold.
It is a prayer so strong that there is no question but that it
will be answered, and is answered continuously.
<p>
At the same time, there is a sense of
reaching outwards, of a power of divine love projecting in every
direction from it; not calling or pulling, but freely flowing
into the world. (This and the prayer-force may be the same, separated
only in my mind.)
<p>
A deep, resonant tone sounds; a tone
from a bell so perfect that it sounds <i>before</i> the mallet
strikes it. The tone repeats; and again. Then it is silent, but
all of space still resonates to it.
<p>
A voice says: &quot;What can man know
of God, save what God gives to man? And yet, if God gives all,
and is free and in all, then man can know God in all things, through
all things. It matters not if one says &quot;This is Holy&quot;
of one thing, and of another &quot;This is not holy.&quot; For
every man sees the divine in the ways that his (or her) nature
allows. And <i>every</i> aspect of their nature has God at its
root. Therefor if one is to know God, then one should know himself;
as completely as possible. And then one should leap beyond oneself.
It matters not in which direction one leaps; one is as good as
another. God is in every direction, including no direction. [That
is, the direction that is not a direction.]
<p>
&quot;And this Temple, built by God
upon the foundation of yours, is as much Hagia Sophia as is that
mundane place of that name. Moreso, since this Temple is wholly
of God; its every stone is of the divine substance, wrought into
form.&quot;
<p>
I see now visions of my four temples
of the Tablets, each one bright with the colors of the squares
out of which it was built. And the altars of those temples are
in their outside positions, surrounding each as the small buildings
of the earlier vision today surrounded the Hagia Sophia. And these
four temples surround the meta-temple as their altars surround
them.
<p>
&quot;Think not, o man who is a mage,
that your temples caused God to build his because he liked their
form, or because you are in some way in his favor; we speak not
of that. But as was said, the four Tablets are themselves a prayer
unto the Great God who is the creator of the Calls and Tablets,
who gave them to man for his use. And as by his covenant he responds
continuously to those prayers, so then must those prayers, when
built into a yet mightier form, produce a yet mightier result.
You had the shaping of it, but the power that called and the power
that answered are both of the divine. 
<p>
&quot;And yet, this form is also eternal;
have not many men sought to use it in their construction of places
of worship? Not only the Sophia, but also those others, foursquare
to the world, but with a domed eye unto God. [E.g., St. Peter's]
<p>
&quot;And every one of these, in this
minds of their creators, brought the power of the divine into
the world. So you are not greatly different from them, save that
yours is of a finer and more effective substance to begin with.
<p>
&quot;Now, if your Temple is opened
by a man, it cannot be but that he will be raised closer to the
divine thereby; for in it is the power to lift and transform,
which is the essence God gave to the Enochian powers, brought
into a state of perfect effectiveness. No man can touch it and
be unchanged by it. Thus few have used it, though it is widely
known. Men fear change, even as they seek it; and when they sense
that change is utterly certain, that their souls will be transformed,
then do they back away, and cover over their fear with thoughts
of due caution. 
<p>
&quot;Only the brave, the desperate,
or the truly adventurous dare take it to its full power; for others,
the thought of it is transformation enough. Let them be; seek
not to encourage. Those who should [use it], will. And if in several
centuries, only a triple handful should follow where you have
led, then you have had success. Not all things are best measured
by quantity. 
<p>
&quot;We are nearly done now. Let us
finish by saying that what you have seen is a true representation
of the powers in this Part. It is not just a commemoration, as
you have thought; the timing is the work of the divine, enabling
that which has been to come together with that which is now, in
perfect alignment. Speak to this, and you will speak true. Amen.&quot;
<p>
The presence of the voice faded, and
along with it the images. I ended the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
The mundane association shown follows
the original attribute for the Part, save that it appears to include
European Constantinople/Istanbul. The next Part in sequence, Usnarda,
is supposed to be that city according to Kelly. But Usnarda's
mundane association is called &quot;Graecia&quot;, which suggests
that the &quot;great citie with the sea hard by&quot; that Kelly
saw is in fact one of the seaports of that land, possibly Piraeus.

<p>
Unlike the immediately preceding Parts,
this Part is entirely &quot;below the Abyss&quot;. It works in
the realm of archetypes, not in the unconditioned transcendental
reality. Thus it is concerned with the formation of such archetypes,
particularly those that draw men towards the divine. 
<p>
 With the movement down into this region
of the Tree of Life, the creative Will or Being of the Supernals
becomes transformed into a power of Love, of  <i>relationship</i>.
It is an active, connecting power. The powers of all the lower
sephiroth are subsumed into Love, for every one of them is a power
that deals with relationships between things. &quot;Love under
Will&quot; is not a philosophical principle that we can follow
or not, as we chose; it is a basic and unavoidable condition of
existence. The god's stated reason for creating the Enochian magick
itself fulfills the conditions for being called an act of (unconditional)
Love under Will.
<p>
Every archetype is an embodiment of
Love. Every one is a distillation of some quality that is present
in a multitude of things, and therefor expresses an essence of
the relationship between them. The form of the Hagia Sophia and
the meta-temple is an archetype of archetypes, representing the
relationship between the transcendental Being (represented by
the dome of Heaven in each) and the finite world as a whole (represented
by the foursquare bodies of the Temples). And within the finite
world, the relationship is reflected again, in the four buildings
that surround the Sophia, and the four elemental temples around
the meta-temple. The elemental temples in turn reflect it down
one more time, in the four sub-elemental altars that are placed
in the quarters around each temple. This is similar to the pattern
shown in the Part named Doanzin, save that the fifth point of
the pentagram is here the dome of the temple.
<p>
When the Voice says that it is God who
calls and God who answers, it speaks not only of the Enochian
system as such. In every true calling towards the divine -- whether
by prayer or by invocation -- it is the divine essence in the
human being that calls, and it is the divine that responds. <br>

Usnarda, Part 32 of 91, 2nd of ICH.
Zodiacal King: Zurchol. Ministers: 7236  mundane association:
Graecia (specified to be Constantinople or Istanbul, not Greece,
by Kelly).
<p>
The vision opens with an image of South
America; it rotates 180 degrees, so that south is at the top,
and zooms in rapidly on the southern coast of Brazil, and focuses
on the city of Rio de Janiero. The sigil of the Part is overlaid
on the bay around which the city is built. The Sugarloaf is between
the start and endpoints of the sigil.
<p>
Now it seems that I am looking at the
city from one of the hills surrounding it. I am one with the great
statue of Jesus that lifts its arms over the city. A voice speaks
from behind me; I (or the statue) resonate with that voice, and
project it outwards onto the city. It speaks in Enochian, a variation
on bits from the first Call: &quot;Casarma ohorela, od farzema
znrza adna od gono IDOIGO.&quot; Unto you I made a law, and you
raised your voices and swore obedience and faith unto Me. This
is not the voice of the Part, but of some god.
<p>
The city responds with joy to the voice;
it seems that Carnival is in progress. Sounds of happy, stimulating
music drift up to where I am; also voices, none of them sorrowing.

<p>
&quot;The Law was not restriction,&quot;
says the voice, &quot;but rather to take joy in the love of God.
And to live one's life in that joy. The world has too much pain;
should god add to it? No; therefore do not excoriate yourselves,
nor do pain unto others in My name. Flay not your bodies and souls;
you do Me no praise thereby.&quot;
<p>
&quot;You are vessels for My love; fill
yourselves to overflowing, for there is more than all of you can
hold. Pour yourselves out onto the world, for there is always
more to fill you again, ever and without end. Amen.&quot;
<p>
I get a couple of impressions here.
First, a true Carnival is not a period of license which must be
repented at a later date. It is in itself an uplifting of the
world and a connecting of the world and the body to the divine,
through celebrations and joy. The word is &quot;carne-&quot;,
flesh, plus the word for &quot;to lift&quot;, literally an elevation
of the flesh. And when the flesh (that is, the worldly being of
the person) is lifted as high as it can get through celebration,
then should the attention be put away from fleshly joys and directed
to the divine, so that it can come down and fill the person, raising
him or her yet higher. 
<p>
Now I get an image of thousands of people
trekking up the side of the mountain on which I stand, carrying
lamps and candles to represent the flame of love for the divine
that is in their hearts. 
<p>
Another voice comes, this one seeming
to be the voice of the Part:
<p>
&quot;When one climbs the Mountain of
God, one must suit one's actions to the nature of the height at
which one is traveling. On the lower slopes, the land is covered
with plants and sweet fruits of tree and vine; therefor in traveling
those slopes one should appreciate what the divine has put there
for one's pleasure, and share of that abundance with one's fellow-travelers.

<p>
&quot;But on the higher slopes, the
divine gives a different sort of abundance. The plants recede,
leaving only stony ground; all that is needed to push oneself
ever higher. But in their place, there is the clear air of the
Spirit, and the light of the Sun unhindered by the clouds of the
lower regions. One partakes of this, and his spirit is fed thereby,
and is strengthened for the journey unto the pinnacle. 
<p>
&quot;And when one reaches the pinnacle
and unites with the beloved, then one turns and from that peak
sends the divine love back into the world, to those who have not
yet attained. There is nothing more to be done, within the worlds
of men; nor is there need for any more.&quot;
<p>
[&quot;Unites with the beloved&quot;
is deliberately ambiguous. The beloved can be either the divine
itself, or another person who is also at the pinnacle. If the
latter, then the two burn themselves up in the act, and each becomes
wholly god for a time.] 
<p>
The image and the presence of the voice
fade away, though the spirit of the Part remains. I end the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
The Zodiacal King ruling this Part is
attributed to Capricorn; hence the images of mountains predominate.

<p>
There were several side-impressions
not mentioned above; they flitted away too quickly, or were lost
in the generally pleasant feel of the Part's power:
<p>
The Sugarloaf is an image of the Yoni;
placed between the endpoints of the sigil, at the mouth of the
Rio bay, it implies that this love pouring into the world comes
from Binah, specifically from that aspect of Nuit which resides
in that sphere. 
<p>
The statue of Jesus on its own mountain
is an expression of that transcendental love within the finite
world; an image of the divine for those who can not yet see it
directly, a goal for them to work towards. Thus the voice of the
God passes through the statue before passing down to the world.
The themes of sacrifice and suffering often associated with the
Christian savior are wholly absent; only the love is present.
The voice of the god later implies that the sacrifice and suffering
are perversions rather than an intrinsic part of the symbol of
his Son.
<p>
This flavor of this Part has a lot in
common with the previous one. The same theme of invocation and
response underlies it. The god sends his spirit into the world,
producing a response from the people; the people invoke the god
in joy, and he responds. 
<p>
As seems usual in these visions, certain
Christian ideas are confirmed, while others are simultaneously
turned on their heads. Carnival is typically considered a period
of officially-sanctioned sinning, a sort of safety valve for the
pressures built up by being &quot;good&quot; the rest of the year.
It is followed immediately by a period of self-denial and repentance
in Lent. But here the Carnival is itself a form of praise of the
divine; not sin at all, but simply the sort of worship appropriate
for the level of existence on which it occurs. The worldly being
is raised up, through worldly joys, to the margin with the world
of the soul. The period of fasting that follows simply continues
the raising; having reached the highest level possible through
worldly activities, one has to put them aside as distractions
and use different techniques to go higher. Repentance and self-abuse
are not part of it.
<p>
The final achievement within the finite
world is represented by the union of the worshiper with the &quot;beloved&quot;.
This is meant in both a symbolic and a practical sense. 
<p>
In the previous Part, I said that Love
(in the sense of unconditional Relationship) is the one aspect
that all spheres &quot;below the Abyss&quot; have in common, and
the one commonality between all the Ideals that are the products
of cabalistic and magickal synthesis. Love is in fact the ultimate
synthesis that can be achieved within the finite levels of existence.

<p>
Further, the experience of that unconditional
Love, existing in the pure state of Love, brings one closer to
the transcendental levels than is possible in any other state
of consciousness, without actually entering into the transcendental
spheres. It forms a near-perfect counterpart to the nature of
Binah, minimizing (though not eliminating) the problems of transition
into that sphere.<br>

Invoked Ponodol using the usual method.
As I completed vibrating the associated names, a cloud of white
smoke drifted down outside, momentarily obscuring the view through
the bank of casement windows in my workroom. I thought there might
be a fire, and ran outside to check; examination of the house
from all sides did not reveal any fire, or any other source for
the smoke. 
<p>
I returned to my room and invoked the
names again.
<p>
The vision opened with an image of men
and women working in a field. They are in a long valley beneath
a massive mountain range. Bare rock begins not far above the valley
floor, and half-starved goats poke among the rocks for food. The
people wear smocks of rough-woven cloth, or simple breechcloths.
Their implements do not appear to be of very good quality.
<p>
Now a troop of soldiers comes down the
valley from the northeast, marching down a dirt road through the
middle of the valley. They carry spears and short swords, both
with bronze blades, and wear back-and-breast armor and plain helmets
with noseguards. They seem derisive or contemptuous of the people
they are passing, as if they were not worth the trouble of raiding
and looting. 
<p>
The soldiers continue southwards, apparently
on their way to some seaport.
<p>
The voice says: &quot;Those who travel
the clear roads of life, towards the obvious goals, sometimes
pass by the greatest of treasures without seeing. And those who
seem the lowliest sometimes hide in their midst that which would
give any man pause, should he come across it in some other venue.&quot;
<p>
Now it seems that the people are moving
towards the side of the nearest mountain, and are chasing away
the goats from one particular area. They roll aside a great stone
(which seems much lighter than its size would warrant) revealing
the mouth of a tunnel. Some of them enter; others gather weapons
and move to various vantage points along the sides of the valley.

<p>
I follow those who enter. The tunnel
passes along for a ways, turns a short corner to the left, and
opens into a large cavern. There is a large platform made of gold
in the center of the cavern, guarded by two statues. The statues
are bulls, crouched in the usual &quot;sphinx&quot; posture, made
of some black stone. Their heads would be about shoulder-height
on a man. Golden ornaments decorate the bulls; collars intricately
carved with scenes of some goddess, nose-rings, gilded horns,
hooves and tail-tufts. A great rectangular panel is at the back
of the platform; it shines with a bright light, illuminating the
whole cavern. I cannot tell if the light is from some natural
source or not.
<p>
The people gather rich garments hung
around the edges of the room, and don them. These are all in earthy
colors, of the sort one might see on an Indian blanket from the
American southwest. But the designs are much more elaborate, and
less abstract than any Zuni or Hopi blanket. I see trees with
great fruits, more images of women or goddesses standing on platforms
on the backs of crouched cattle, others I cannot discern clearly.
<p>
It seems that the outside of this hill
is a sort of Potempkin village in reverse, making things to seem
less than they are.
<p>
The people gather around the edges of
the platform, and stand facing inwards. They stay a while in silent
contemplation, or perhaps in preparation for some work. There
are thirteen of them, seven on the front, three to each side,
behind the bulls.
<p>
My viewpoint rises to the ceiling; I
can see the top of the platform now. There is a circle scribed
on it, its outer ring inlaid with alternate rays of lapis lazuli
and ivory (or perhaps horn?). In the center is a rather simple
sigil, thus:
<p>
[insert sigil] [The sigil is somewhat
like a cursive capital &quot;S&quot; with a long tail.]
<p>
A small star like an asterisk appears
at the starting point of the sigil, but not touching it. The floor
around and beneath the sigil darkens, and other asterisk-like
shapes appear, seemingly at random and of various sizes. The floor
takes on an appearance of depth, and it now looks like a stylized
image of a starry sky, seen through a porthole.
<p>
Not a sound has occurred; all this has
taken place in complete silence.
<p>
A stylized sun rises out of the depths;
it has a small central disk, surrounded by wavy-edged rays like
flames. I count thirteen of them. The rays seem too large for
them all to be connected to the disk, but they are; and without
overlapping or crowding each other. Some spatial distortion must
be in effect to accomplish this. The sun obscures the lower portion
of the sigil, between the two tails. The sigil is pulled slightly
into the depths by its presence.
<p>
Now the people step onto the platform
one at a time, and walk out onto the sun-symbol. As both feet
touch the symbol, each vanishes as if sucked down into it. Soon
all of them are gone. I move to follow them, but something stops
me; and the voice says: &quot;You shall not, at this time.&quot;
<p>
I wait for a while. Then the depth-like
quality of the circle gradually fades, as do the asterisk-stars.
The circle is again gold in the center, with the sigil inscribed
on it; but the sun remains inscribed as part of the sigil.
<p>
I am instructed to leave and invoke
again another time. I return fully to my body and end the vision.
<p>
Seer's notes:
<p>
Lycia is one of those rare places on
Earth where absolutely nothing of importance ever happened. An
appropriate venue for something hidden among the lowest.
<p>
I get the impression that the thirteen-rayed
sun is from a religious mythos in which the year is measured by
a lunar calendar and zodiac rather than by the twelve-sign solar
zodiac. Given the Bulls guarding the holy place, this might be
a representation of the symbols from some religion of that ancient
age.
<p>
(As I write this, an image comes to
me of the Moon's orbit, tilted with respect to the ecliptic plane.
It precesses rapidly, looking like a barrel-hoop someone has spun
and allowed to lose its momentum. The inside of this hoop is divided
into sections with pictures, but I cannot see them clearly --
it is all moving too fast.)
<p>
The diminution of the sun's central
circle is important in some way, but I do not know what way.
<p>
Friday, November 24, 1995  3:52 PM
<p>
Invoked the Part according to the usual
method.
<p>
Prior to doing the invocation, while
reading over the previous day's vision, I began to get images
of abstract sigils of some sort, one after another. These, it
seemed to me, were the &quot;signs&quot; that should be around
the rim of the wheel of Luna's orbit, as mentioned in the comments.
I got the first four of them, and then the got the sense that
I should do the invocation and begin the vision.
<p>
I am standing in the circle of invocation,
upon the sigil of the Part. Around me the air clears to reveal
the wheel of the Moon, but now viewed from its center. Behind
it, and crossing it in two places, is the wheel of the zodiac.
<p>
Now the voice says: &quot;Is it not
said: 'His eyes are the Lights of Heaven'? And is it not said
that 'in his hands the Sun is as a sword and the Moon a through-thrusting
fire'? And are not his Tables made twelve by thirteen? And thus
is the Moon equal to the Sun, in the powers of our God.
<p>
&quot;See, o man who is a mage, see
and know as we show you these things, that the powers of God are
twofold; and what you see is his feminine part. Now look.&quot;
<p>
I looked at the wheel of Luna, and it
rotated around me so that the descending node was in front of
me. A sigil showed to the right of the point of intersection,
the first of those I sensed earlier. It is like the sigil of Cauda
Draconis, save that two little lines extend upwards beyond the
curls at either side. And now an image of a woman appears behind
the sigil, and the sigil itself becomes a cauldron or stewpot
which she holds by its two handles. She holds it in front of her
lower belly.
<p>
<img src="images/img04348.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="204">
<p>
&quot;This is she who nourishes the
world, giving of her substance that men might live. Do her honor,
o men, for she is your savior in truth; without her, you would
not be.&quot;
<p>
Now the circle moves slightly to the
left, and I am looking at the next sigil going clockwise. This
one looks like a round-bottomed &quot;W&quot;, with a tail going
off to the right from the right-hand point of the &quot;W&quot;.
An image appears behind the sigil. It is a rear view of a nude
woman seated on the edge of a pool; the &quot;tail&quot; of the
sigil is part of her right leg, the &quot;W&quot; is her seat.
She seems to be washing herself carefully, especially her pudenda;
and now it seems that she is washing a newborn child.
<p>
<img src="images/img20926.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="61">
<p>
&quot;This is the third of the sigils,
not the second. Record it as such.&quot; Done.
<p>
The wheel turns again, and I see another
sigil. This one looks somewhat like a modernistic Lamed. The image
forms behind; a woman bare from the waist up. She holds a child
in the crook of her right arm, and offers her breast to the child.
The horizontal bar of the sigil is her left arm, the slightly
curved upper vertical is the child's head; the slanted lower vertical
is the left side (her left) of her torso, curving down to her
waist.
<p>
<img src="images/img30091.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="314">
<p>
&quot;This is the fifth of the sigils;
record it as such.&quot; Done.
<p>
The wheel turns again, and another sigil
comes into view. This one is too complex to describe in words,
a set of curves attached at their endpoints. The image behind
it shows a left profile of a pregnant woman, near to term, raising
a two-year-old child to the Moon. At some moments it seems that
she offers a basket of grain and fruits instead. This section
contains the ascending lunar node.
<p>
<img src="images/img06871.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="256">
<p>
(I sense this is the seventh sigil in
clockwise order.)
<p>
The next division clockwise is dark;
I can see nothing there. In the following division, I see the
image of a woman in a field. She is in an odd posture, half-squatting.
Her feet are apart and turned outward, her knees bent so that
her calves are vertical. Her back is straight. With her right
hand she drops seeds into a hole; her left holds  pointed staff,
point downwards. 
<p>
The sigil is hard to see. It appears
to start at her right shoulder, making a smooth curve to the left
and then back to her right foot. Another curve rises up to her
left hand, touching her womb at its midpoint, and then down the
staff, ending in a small curl. Almost like a backwards &quot;N&quot;.
<p>
<img src="images/img28681.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="344">
<p>
&quot;This is the ninth of his signs.
Record it as such.&quot; Done.
<p>
The energy of the Part seems to be flagging,
but I get an indication I should continue.
<p>
The circle turns again, and the next
sigil I see is a very simple one, like an upside-down &quot;V&quot;
with both arms the same height, but the right-hand arm stretched
out farther away from the top point than the left arm. An image
forms behind it of a woman in right profile, pushing a wheelbarrow
or cart laden with foodstuffs. The sigil begins at her right foot,
goes up to where her hands grasp the barrow's handles, and down
again to the barrow's wheel.
<p>
<img src="images/img31654.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="117">
<p>
&quot;Now you see the eleventh sigil
in order. Do you record it as such.&quot; Done.
<p>
The wheel turns again, coming to the
section just before the descending node. Here the sigil is like
an &quot;m&quot;, but with three upwards loops, the middle one
larger than the two outer ones. An image forms behind it of a
woman seated in a chair; her arms are around the shoulders of
two children, hugging them close; a girl-child on her right, a
boy on her left. She wears a look of contentment.
<p>
<img src="images/img26594.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="152">
<p>
&quot;And the final, thirteenth, sigil
is done. Do you look at these as The Seven, o man, and comprehend
them thus. And invoke again to acquire the sigils of The Six,
another day. And with that shall you know the woman-self of God
complete. And we are done for this time.&quot;
<p>
I thanked the voice of the Part, and
ended the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
As Dee said in another context, &quot;this
diversity of reckoning by sixes and sevens I cannot yet well reconcile.&quot;
And I should add, by twelves and thirteens as well. 
<p>
Perhaps these seven relate to the Lunar
phases shown in Parts 20 through 27. But note that there is no
consistent relationship between orbital position and lunar phase;
the rapid precession and the Earth's movement mean that Luna can
be in any phase at any point in its orbit.
<p>
I get a vague impression that these
thirteen feminine &quot;signs&quot; alternate negative and positive,
as do the signs of the traditional zodiac. If so, then the Six
will show a more positive, effortful, or outward-looking aspect
than the ones seen today.
<p>
My initial impression is that these
seven all relate in some way to reproduction and the care of the
children. Free-associating:
<p>
1 - Pregnancy. The sigil suggests a
full womb, with the ovaries on either side. Or a woman's belly
at full term, protruding out between the hip bones. The image
supports either one of these, with the &quot;cauldron&quot; held
directly in front of her womb. If &quot;The Seven&quot; are planets,
this would fit well with Luna.
<p>
3 - Cleansing the body and newborn of
the mess of birth. The shape of the sigil suggests waves on a
pond, as well as that shown by the image. Mercury/Hod as Water?
Perhaps something to do with Mercury's medical connections.
<p>
5 - Feeding the newborn. I don't see
how this would fit with Venus/Netzach, which is more closely related
to &quot;values&quot; of various sorts, and to personal motivation.
Except that the urge to care for a child is a strong form of motivation.

<p>
7 - A dedication, perhaps akin to a
christening ceremony? Or perhaps a public presentation of the
child to show it without defects? The sector's position at the
ascending node would tend to support the former. It is odd that
the woman is shown as again pregnant; is there some sort of duality
or double-cycle involved? Note that the thirteenth image shows
<i>two</i> children. Sol/Tiphereth of Luna?
<p>
Note that as in the regular zodiac,
there is a division in type between the &quot;signs&quot; on either
side of the equinoctial axis (or its lunar equivalent, the nodal
axis). Those on the lower side are personal in nature, those on
the upper side more public and general.
<p>
9 - Planting. I thought that this might
be Mars, but the eleventh sigil brought with it a strong sense
of effort being expended. This one might be Jupiter.
<p>
11 - Reaping. Mars.
<p>
13 - Completion = Saturn. Survival of
the children through the effort of previous sectors.
<p>
Saturday, November 25, 1995  1:09 PM
<p>
As the vision began, the circle moved
out from under my feet to a position in front of me. The names
and sigils vanished from its face, and the center became first
an image of the &quot;sun&quot; seen in the first vision, then
a circle divided into thirteen parts. This circle gained width,
and became the ring of the &quot;lunar zodiac&quot; seen yesterday.

<p>
A voice says: &quot;Blessings, blessings,
blessings, unto she who is our life, and the life of all things;
for she has divided herself, that that life might be made to flourish
upon the Earth. Give of yourself in the same way, o woman; for
upon you is the continuance of things founded and maintained.
Let not the ways of men deceive and divert you; for they who rise
high do also fall; they who govern are governed in their turn,
though they know it not. Their glory fades, and is forgotten in
a moment; another takes their place. They have no certainty, save
that of eventual loss. 
<p>
&quot;But that which runs with the heavens,
[i.e., that which follows the Moon's cycle] continuing ever, that
is not lost. Its constant change is its stability; it continues,
with certainty, bringing forth the world. And why should one who
has this desire the momentary glories of men?
<p>
[In response to my thought about the
seeming chauvinism of this:]
<p>
&quot;Now, we seek not to put women
&quot;in their place&quot;; their nature should be glorified itself,
not denigrated. And if one who, having known the Moon, wishes
also to know the ways of men, then what of it? She can do both,
in her time, as men cannot. Yet she should not become lost in
those ways; for they take her away from herself. To become an
imitation man, fighting as he fights, ever striving, is no achievement.

<p>
&quot;Now take us away from this o Goddess,
and let this man look upon the cycle again.&quot;
<p>
Now the top of the ring [which has remained
visible throughout this speech] tilts towards me, and the ring
moves over and around me so that I stand again in its center.
I realize suddenly that this ring is reversed from the actual
state of things. In the physical world, the point I have been
calling the &quot;descending node&quot; is actually the ascending
node. The voice says: &quot;That which is ascending in the movement
of the moon is descending in the movement of the nodes; [that
is, in the precessional movement] therefore is this shown aright.&quot;
<p>
The ring rotates around me so that the
first and third sigils are visible. In the empty sector between,
a new sigil appears. This one is composed of three downward-pointing
spikes, followed by a curve composed of about one-third of a circle.
A smaller curve begins the sigil.
<p>
<img src="images/img09189.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="340">
<p>
An image appears behind the sigil. It
is of a naked pregnant woman seen from the front; she is slightly
crouched over, as if just hit with a stomach cramp. Streams of
water burst forth from between her legs; these are the three spikes
of the sigil. It seems that this is the initial strong contraction
of birth, which bursts the amniotic sac and lets forth its fluids.
<p>
&quot;This is her Strength&quot; says
the voice, &quot;what man can match it, for length and intensity
of effort? [I.e., the entire effort of childbirth.] What man could
endure it, if he could experience it? Let it be marked as the
second of thirteen, and the first of Six.&quot; Done.
<p>
&quot;And be it known that another strength
is hidden therein; look again at the sigil.&quot;
<p>
Now the image behind the sigil is a
side-view of a woman, facing to my left. The initial small curve
of the sigil is her mons pubis; the large terminating curve is
her gluteus. The three spikes emanate from the folds of her labia;
one from her clitoris, one from her urethra, one from her vagina.
They are like lightning bolts of a vivid purple hue.  
<p>
&quot;This is a mystery, o man, one
which you are not well fitted to decipher. Though it is not beyond
you.&quot;
<p>
The ring turns so that the third and
fifth sigils are now before me. In the blank sector between, another
appears. Three curves, each curved towards the center. Too simple
to describe without a lot of verbiage. An image forms behind it
of a woman lying in bed. She is propped up on large, comfortable
pillows, surrounded and covered from the waist down by down comforters.
There is a sense of richness about the scene, of material comforts
gathered to her use. Her knees are raised beneath the blankets,
and her child is propped up against them. She examines the child
with a look of joy.
<p>
<img src="images/img09531.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="174">
<p>
&quot;This is her Glory, to see the
fruits of her labor before her, and to know she brought it forth.
And in the night does she hold her Treasure to her, and sing praises
of the goddess within herself. Mark this as the fourth of thirteen,
and the second of the Six.&quot; Done.
<p>
&quot;Now turn to the last of this side.&quot;
<p>
The ring turns so that the fifth and
seventh sigils are before me, and a new one appears between. Two
concentric quarter-circles, curved towards the upper left; a line
like a reversed &quot;j&quot; connects them at their right ends.
<p>
An image appears behind the sigil, of
a woman bending down over a crib, wrapping blankets around a child
therein. The child looks up at her with an expression of awe.
<p>
<img src="images/img01255.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="204">
<p>
&quot;This is her Responsibility, that
her creation needs be supervised and protected, and its needs
seen to for many years of Time.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Mark this as the sixth of thirteen,
and the third of the Six.&quot; Done.
<p>
The ring turns again to show both seventh
and ninth sigils. In the space between them, the image of a woman
making bread appears. She faces me, and kneads the bread on a
table in front of her. Around her are the implements of cooking,
and for various home crafts. 
<p>
I cannot see the sigil clearly, and
wait for it, looking closely. Once again, three simple curves;
I feel like there ought to be a fourth, but cannot discern where
it would appear in the sigil. Now there is a sense that a sun
is shining down upon her from the upper right corner of the image,
from outside whatever dwelling contains her, and that this is
an invisible presence that I mistook for a fourth line in the
sigil.
<p>
<img src="images/img17354.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="355">
<p>
&quot;This is her Wealth, that she have
the resources to maintain her creation and make it grow; and she
is the Magician who combines that wealth according to her Art.&quot;
(I note that her posture is remarkably like that of the Magician
tarot card. And now it seems that the sigil is the profile of
the house in which she works.)
<p>
&quot;Mark this as the eighth of thirteen,
and the fourth of the Six.&quot; Done.
<p>
The ring rotates to the next blank sector.
Once again I have trouble seeing anything; the power of the Part
seems to be fading quickly. I wait, and a sigil slowly appears.
Three curves again, this time forming a &quot;W&quot;. But where
the sigil of the third sector was a round-bottomed &quot;w&quot;,
this one has points below, and a single half-circle making up
the center section. 
<p>
Now an image appears. It is of a small
village green, upon which children play while their mothers watch
from seats around the perimeter. The two outer arms of the sigil
are like lanes leading in to the green. 
<p>
<img src="images/img04764.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="105">
<p>
&quot;This is her Joy, that her children
are healthy and active, and become more themselves as time passes.
And their play is her play, the relief from duty and the chance
for relaxation of responsibility, by sharing it with others like
her. Mark this as the tenth of thirteen, and the fifth of the
Six.&quot; Done.
<p>
The ring moves once more, to the last
of the blank sectors. Here there quickly appears another sigil,
a small half-circle above, curve downwards; below, a shallow,
long-armed &quot;V&quot;. A fourth line goes from the left end
of the &quot;V&quot; to the left end of the semicircle.
<p>
The image develops as quickly. The woman
is lying under a tree. It is night and she looks up at the sky,
wherein a full moon shines. Her face reflects the Moon's light,
becoming moon-like itself.
<p>
<img src="images/img21546.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="186">
<p>
The voice says: &quot;This is her Peace,
that she become like her goddess; still and reflective, yet ever
changing. The steady rhythm of her change becomes like silence.
<p>
&quot;And this is the last of the Six.
Mark it as such, and include the sigils in your record.
<p>
&quot;Now it is best that you invoke
this Part once more, that we might show you some other things
about it. For this concentration on the details distracts from
those other aspects. Keep as you have been doing in your other
exercises, as these have a cumulative effect with what is being
done here in Ponodol. Seek us again, on another day, and we will
finish.
<p>
&quot;For now, we are done.&quot;
<p>
I thanked the voice, and ended the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
I admit to having some difficulty dealing
with the image of woman presented here; it seems too medieval
and chauvinistic. But perhaps I am like those soldiers in the
first vision, incapable of appreciating what I am seeing. A peasant
woman from Mexico or India might find it perfectly appropriate
and valuable.
<p>
My impression is that these sectors
called &quot;The Six&quot; have planetary attributes like the
previous &quot;Seven&quot;, save that there is no sector for the
Sun in this group. The sectors fit more or less into the sequence
presented previously, but with the planets running in almost-reverse
order:
<p>
2 - Mars. The muscular effort of childbirth
is emphasized, and woman's greater resistance to pain. The lightning-bolts
are another form of Power, which (as was said) I don't immediately
understand. Possibly something to do with the chakras related
to the three body-parts, viz. Frater PVN. 
<p>
4 - Jupiter, due to the &quot;sense
of richness&quot; and &quot;treasure&quot; references, and in
the priestly sense because she sings praises to her goddess.
<p>
6 - Saturn, as authority/responsibility,
and as Time.
<p>
8 - Mercury, from the obvious Magician
references, and because the sigil is her House (BITh, means &quot;house&quot;)
<p>
10 - Venus, from the references to joy
and play. Netzach as the sphere of the Persona, in the refs. to
her children &quot;becoming more themselves&quot;. 
<p>
12 - Luna, for obvious reasons.
<p>
If this is in fact a symbolization of
a &quot;lunar zodiac&quot; then I don't quite see the logic of
it. There is a certain sense to the placement of the planetary
attributes, which can be seen if the thirteenth sector is placed
at the top of the wheel; most of the planets are equidistant from
it on either side. It would make even more sense if my tentative
attributes for the third and fifth sectors were switched around.
This is reasonable in the case of the third sector; the &quot;nymph
by the pool&quot; image is a long-standing Venusian symbol. But
I cannot see how Mercury would fit with the breast-feeding image
of the fifth sector.
<p>
Sunday, November 26, 1995  2:29 PM
<p>
Invoked Ponodol according to the usual
procedure.
<p>
I found myself back in the Temple of
the first vision of this Part, standing between the two bulls
that guard the circle. The center of the circle is back in its
&quot;starry&quot; form, and the thirteen-rayed &quot;sun&quot;
seen before is still there, as is the sigil. Now upon the rays
of the sun I can see the sigils given to me over the last two
visions, and in the body of the &quot;sun&quot; I can see a glyph
of Luna, a crescent moon overlaying a full moon.
<p>
(I put the word &quot;sun&quot; in quotes
because I do not believe it is actually intended to represent
Sol. Rather, the formation is like a shield or escutcheon.)
<p>
The voice of the Part tells me I may
now walk forward, and I do so, stopping when I stand upon the
shield. After a moment it seems as if I am falling through the
shield, while simultaneously being pulled through the glowing
panel at the back of the Temple. I get the impression that in
some way these two movements are really the same movement seen
in different ways.
<p>
Now I am in a long hall, moving rapidly
along its length. It curves in many directions as I pass. Every
ten feet or so, the halls is guarded by another pair of Bulls.
The style with which these are made changes gradually. At first
they are realistic representations, as one might see in a modern
sculpture or a Hindu temple. Moving further, they become stylized
in different ways in turn: Assyrian, Minoan, Egyptian, several
others I do not immediately recognize. The final few look like
three-dimensional versions of the Neolithic cave-paintings; more
abstract than even the most modern styles, but expressing the
movement and shape of the animal in a few elegantly smoothed curves.

<p>
Now the cave ends, and I am in a primeval
glade, with a pool in the middle. The full moon reflects perfectly
in the pool; there is no wind to disturb the waters. And around
the pool are the thirteen figures who passed this way before me
in the first vision of the Part. 
<p>
I can see that these are all women.
They gaze down at the pool in rapt attention, each focused on
the Moon's reflection. Now they shed their garments and enter
the pool from all sides. Their entry does not disturb the waters;
the Moon's reflection remains the same. Each puts her cupped hands
into the water and lifts them up again through the area of the
reflection. They pour the water over their heads. Gathering more
water, they pour it over their breasts; yet more, and they pour
it over their bellies, so that it drips down their clefts.
<p>
They sink down slightly so that the
water is up to their waists; they join hands and begin a prayer
of some sort, directed at the Moon in the sky.
<p>
A wind comes down from the sky, the
breath of the Moon. And now the waters of the pool are disturbed.
The ripples reflect randomly for a while, but then they come together,
distorting the image of the Moon in such a way that it becomes
the image of a bull's head. 
<p>
This image becomes more solid-seeming,
and suddenly a Minotaur bursts up through the surface; large,
muscular, with dark-brown skin and a mane of crinkly black hair
down the back of his head. He wears no clothes. He is very well-hung,
uncircumcised, and fully erect. He bellows and roars as if in
some intense anguish, or as if full of some power that he cannot
contain, which will torment him until he releases it. 
<p>
He grabs and mounts each woman in turn,
taking the first face-forward, human style. The second he takes
from behind, the third from in front, alternating around the circle
until he has taken all of them. Thus he has taken seven in human
fashion, six in the manner of the animal. 
<p>
With each woman he mounts, he seems
to become slightly less solid, and slightly less wild. By the
time he takes the last, he is a shadow, and seems exhausted. The
women, however, are energized, each in a different way; I can
tell by the colors of their auras. The Minotaur falls backwards
into the center of the pool, all but his head covered by the water.
His eyes roll up in his head and he sinks completely below in
a swoon. The waters are still once more, showing the full Moon's
reflection.
<p>
And now the voice says: &quot;In these
most ancient times, every child was a Child of the Moon; a child
of the Goddess begotten upon her worldly equivalents. The Bull
-- and therefore every man -- was simply a vehicle by which her
Power was transferred from the heavens to the Earth, by which
her innate Fecundity was made manifest. Men, those vehicles, were
constructed by Her so that they could not keep her power for themselves,
but must ever release it to the women who serve her.
<p>
&quot;It was said (perhaps with some
humor) that if men even tried to hold that power, or simply could
not release it, it would drive them mad. Men's urge to hunt and
fight, to poke animals and each other with their spears, was a
sign of this madness; a mad substitution of one spear for another.
For when a man had truly released all the Moon's energy unto its
rightful recipients, then the man became relaxed, docile, and
disinclined to any efforts.
<p>
(A side comment from somewhere unknown:
&quot;Or as your feminists might say, man is woman's way of making
more women.&quot;)
<p>
I get a flash here, of an ancient religion
in which each woman was initiated into adulthood by sexual congress
with a priest wearing a bull-mask; a formalization of the myth.
This carried on into civilized (in the sense of &quot;citified&quot;)
times in the rituals of the Goddess in Mesopotamia and elsewhere.
And in the agricultural cultures, the power of the Moon contained
within the man was sometimes put to purposes of fecundating the
fields instead of fecundating women, by slaying him there. But
more often a priestess would take the power into herself, and
then afterwards distribute it among the fields. Perhaps also it
has something to do with the traditional idea that a coven must
contain exactly thirteen witches.
<p>
(And I am reminded, parenthetically,
that many years ago I was told that Set's first form among men
was with the head of a bull of some wild species of cattle; I
still have the sketch of that head somewhere around here. The
lunar quality of the horns in that sketch is even more pronounced
than in domesticated cattle.)
<p>
&quot;Woman is ever the foundation of
culture. It's customs and practices must be centered around her
body and its needs. When this is not so, then that culture is
subject to the violent rises and falls that are man's way; such
cultures inevitably fail. Such cultures might rise high, as now,
but they as surely fall again, to a level where again the needs
of woman and children again become paramount in everyone's minds.&quot;
<p>
There is more, but I cannot hear it,
only sense it dimly. Something to do with the need for a jump
in perspective if current levels of technology and comfort are
to be maintained. That is, to a perspective that places its priorities
as stated here, but has a breadth of vision to account for how
the limits of our environment and resources affect the survival
of all women and children.
<p>
And now the Moon of the vision fades,
falling down below the horizon, and everything becomes dark. I
cannot see any more; I end the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
The basic theme running throughout these
visions is that the female principle is the principle of continuation
and maintenance, as the male principle (seen in other visions)
is that of creation and change. Without the female principle,
change would be chaotic; each change wiped out entirely by the
next. With the female foundation, change becomes progress, each
necessarily building on the changes that came before.
<p>
The female contains the male, both in
the amatory and the spiritual senses; in her, the power of change
is modified by the power of continuation to become Rhythm or cyclic
manifestation. Physically, her body follows the Moon. Socially
her children recreate, in a new phase, the cycle of birth-life-death
that she herself goes through, allowing for the extension of culture
over time. Spiritually the transcendental Mother takes the impulses
of the many Fathers and transforms them into enduring forms. The
universe, manifestation of the divine Mother and Fathers, evidences
cyclic behavior in all of its parts.
<p>
The tunnel of this vision is a symbol
of the enduring presence of the female principle, underlying all
societies while remaining essentially unchanged itself. The bull-statues
are in many different styles, but they remain bulls nonetheless.
<p>
The thirteen women obviously relate
to the thirteen sectors of the &quot;lunar zodiac&quot; in the
previous two visions of the Part. When the Minotaur takes them,
each becomes energized in a different manner. Possibly these thirteen
women/sectors are archetypes of different kinds of women, represent
different personality focuses within the overall theme of womanhood.
I will leave that for those better suited to judge.
