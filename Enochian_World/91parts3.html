Tapamal, Part 34 of 91, 1st of LOE.
Zodiacal King: Zurchol  Ministers: 2658  Mundane association:
Onigap (deduced by Turner to be Yucatan and Central Mexico, on
the basis of Kelly's descriptions.)
<p>
Tuesday, November 28, 1995  4:57 PM
<p>
Considering the Part last night, I sensed
that I would have difficulty getting into it; probably because
its nature is at odds with those Parts from ICH. This one is dark
and wild by comparison. This invocation is a warm-up, to get me
used to the energies and focused into their ways.
<p>
Invoked according to the usual procedure.
<p>
There is some confusion; I get images
that relate to widely separated parts of the world. One of these
is Kali as the Dark Mother, wearing a necklace of skulls, dancing
on the bodies of the dead. 
<p>
Then the image changes and I see a man;
he might be an Indian from Central America, or he might be Polynesian
of the breed who settled Rapa Nui and set up the god-statues in
their own image. The man is wearing a necklace of long feathers,
brightly colored like the plumage of parrots or birds of paradise.
 Beads of turquoise and gold separate the feathers and keep them
rayed across his chest. He has some sort of hat on, or it might
be a crown, made of stiff leather; it forms an upright ring around
his head. It has squarish, stylized glyphs or pictures embossed
upon it.  He wears a skirt of red, heavy cloth, mid-thigh length.
<p>
He holds a war-club in his left hand,
and an obsidian knife with a gold handle in his right. He stands
in the middle of a field of corpses, and his legs are stained
with blood up to the knees, as are his arms to the elbows. If
this is Yucatan, the man must be either Maya or Toltec; I don't
know enough to tell the difference.
<p>
This man is a panther, or his name is
&quot;Panther&quot;, or his power is that of a panther -- like
a totem animal; perhaps all three of these. He killed all those
around him, and none dared to resist him. There is a terrible
freedom in his eyes, and an even more terrible sense of separation
from other men; he sees no limits on his actions, none at all.
His spirit laps up the life-force of the dying and becomes exalted
from it. He sees himself as a great cat stalking the land, taking
whoever he meets for his prey, forcing the lesser beings to build
a den suited to his stature and then to answer to his will. In
his own mind, he is a power beyond all other powers; even the
gods are within his control. 
<p>
I don't want to see any more at the
moment. 
<p>
I know without it being spoken that
this Part relates to the path of Capricorn, which connects Binah
with Tiphereth in Achad's Tree. This is the &quot;Devil&quot;
aspect of the path, in its worst form, in which the individualized
self tries to take on the unlimited, undifferentiated quality
of Binah while retaining its &quot;selfness&quot;. 
<p>
Friday, December 01, 1995  4:35 PM
<p>
Invoked Tapamal according to the usual
procedure.
<p>
A great deal of resistance to entering
this Part. I do not know what it is, but there is an intimation
of great danger; somewhere, something is gibbering in fear, and
this is leaking over into me. 
<p>
A quick flash shows the sigil of the
Part overlaid on Central America. It roughly follows the west
coast of Yucatan, with the final line cutting across to the Pacific
at the ithsmus west of there in Mexico. Guatemala is also contained
within the power of the Part. 
<p>
I am in complete darkness now; an oppressive
darkness, as if shielded from even the dim light of the night-sky
by some canopy above. The air is extremely humid, and carries
smells and tastes of decay. Still the fear is present, somehow
preventing me from entering any further -- or rather, from seeing
what is surely all around me. The fear narrows perceptions. I
tell myself that it is not my own fear that I am feeling, and
immediately there is a sense of opening up, as the space around
me expands into a whole world.
<p>
A pair of yellow cats-eyes open and
peer at me from ten or twelve feet away. It is a jaguar, as black
as its surroundings. Only the eyes and a faint sheen on its fur
distinguish it. 
<p>
Now I am in the jaguar, looking out
from its eyes. The surroundings are not dark from this viewpoint;
I am in a jungle, looking at a very small hole in it created by
a fallen tree, too small to even be called a clearing. A capybara
or some similar large rodent huddles underneath the tree, tense
and ready to flee at any moment. 
<p>
I can feel the jaguar's mouth watering.
It gets ready to charge and pounce on the rodent. But the rodent
senses something and quickly jumps away into the undergrowth.
The jaguar paces forward and sniffs at the spot where it had been.
It looks both ways along the tree-trunk, then turns to the right
and moves silently towards the exposed rootball of the tree.
<p>
Coming around the roots, it looks at
their underside. It sees several small rodents hidden among the
roots. It bats at the roots with one paw, and manages to hook
one of them out on its claws. It grabs it with its mouth, crunches
it once, and swallows. The other rodents squeak and cower deeper
in the roots. The jaguar takes and eats another, and then walks
away, looking for bigger game.
<p>
The voice says: &quot;To the small and
weak, death is a great hunter; one who cannot be overcome nor
propitiated. One may only hope that it takes another and leaves
one alone for another day. 
<p>
&quot;It is the fear of the hunted that
you felt on entering this Part, o man who is a mage; its terror
mirrors the terror of men when they confront the 'Abyss' [I could
hear the quotes] unprepared. Binah is the huntress and the darkness
that conceals it; her absence of qualities is sheer terror to
those whose self demands that existence be qualified. What choice
does such a one have, in the face of Her, save to freeze or to
flee? 
<p>
&quot;One can step forward into the
jaws of death, but for many that is no choice; the seeming extinction
of self is an unacceptable solution. One may flee, but once the
hunter has the scent, there is no true escape; the emptiness pursues,
and one lives one's time in fear of negation. One may freeze,
ceasing movement and change, but that too is a death; the nature
of life is change, and if one fights change, then one is soon
exhausted, and dies despite one's efforts.
<p>
I get images here of a stepped pyramid
with a small temple at the summit. Priests stand before an altar
in front of the temple, and a human sacrifice is tied on the altar,
his chest forced upwards so that the breastbone is exposed to
the knife. And the sense is that this is identical with the &quot;Devil&quot;
card of the Tarot, with its man and woman chained to the altar.

<p>
&quot;The priests fear the negation
of Binah, which they perceive as a great hungry emptiness, not
as the glorious fullness that it is. And they sacrifice others
to propitiate that emptiness, never thinking of sacrificing themselves.
And in doing so, they become that very emptiness that they fear
so greatly; it seeps into them and permeates them, eating away
at them until they are only shells. Neither the soul nor the greater
life is left to them; they are hollow and dead; there is no immortal
part left in them.
<p>
&quot;And in the end, the sacrifice
becomes their own survival, for a time. They no longer seek to
placate a hungry god, but to suck up the life of those killed
to counteract the emptiness that eats away at them. But even this
does not avail them; pieces of themselves continue to slough away
like the body of a leper, until nothing cohesive is left, and
they are gone forever.
<p>
&quot;Now there is no point in continuing;
you understand all too well, and rightly do not wish to. Come
again to the next Part in order, and continue on. We are done.&quot;
<p>
I ended the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
My being is not suited to dealing with
this Part. I had my experiences of ultimate Fear very early in
my magickal career. Since then it has not played a very great
role in my development; Pain (a different Martial aspect) replaced
it for most purposes. One should not place too much confidence
in either my perception of the Part or my comments thereon.
<p>
Capricorn and its Tarot card have many
possible interpretations, most of them of a positive nature. The
sign is the sign of initiation, of the effort and discipline necessary
to achieve a goal, and the high place that one comes to through
that effort. But the sign's ruler, Saturn, is not only the planet
of structure and discipline, but also of endings and terminations.
Mars, exalted therein, is not only the Work and Will of the magician,
but also the planet of violence and fear. The negative, degenerate
qualities of the sign and planets predominate in this Part.
<p>
The man seen in Tuesday's vision is
an historical personage. One of the early Mayan kings, the one
who created most of their empire, was named &quot;Jaguar&quot;
or &quot;Red Jaguar&quot;, something of the sort. If I remember
correctly, the custom of the times was that nobility captured
in battle were sacrificed by the winning king to the gods of his
kingdom, and apparently went to their deaths willingly. Death-oriented
religions and cultures -- as the Mayans, Aztecs and some Kali-cults
-- are one part of the path's nature. 
<p>
The perceptual state of this king is
another example of the grandiose form of schizophrenia mentioned
in connection with an earlier Part. Here it is depicted as the
result of a downflow of Binah-force, in its form-destroying aspect,
combined with the self-exaltation typical of the Solar consciousness.

<p>
Friday's vision depicts these two forces
in a more common form, in which the superior Binah-force does
not combine with the Solar, but instead overshadows it. The result
is the fear, terror, and sense of imminent destruction of the
traditional &quot;Abyss&quot; experience as described by Crowley.

<p>
The Binah-force enters the person along
a dimension that he cannot perceive and in which he is incapable
of acting. He is effectively helpless before it, and has no real
escape. Hence its depiction as the invisible Huntress. Several
possible reactions to this situation are shown. 
<p>
The best, but least desirable from a
Self-interested viewpoint, is to actively submit oneself to the
death-experience. &quot;Freezing&quot; and &quot;fleeing&quot;
are the two instinctual variations of the flight-or-fight syndrome;
neither is successful in doing more than delaying the inevitable.
If one has gone far enough on the path that one has contacted
the Binah energies, it is already too late to avoid their effect;
the conscious self is the last part of the being to perceive the
contact, so it is already well-established. &quot;Freezing&quot;,
that is, resisting the changes it makes, is also futile; the finite
cannot overcome the infinite, only make the effects more painful.
<p>
The remaining response is one that leads
to the creation of a Black Brother. The being seeks to separate
itself from the transfinite by objectifying it, creating a finite
image between himself and it. Crowley called this image Choronzon,
the &quot;demon of the Abyss&quot;; for others it might be Satan,
Chthulhu, Set, Huitzilopochtli, or some other such image. The
being then attempts to propitiate this demon -- and delay his
own demise -- by feeding other people as substitutes. 
<p>
Note that if we were going up the Tree
instead of from the top down, this Part, with its emphasis on
Fear, would come before the Parts from ICH, all of which relate
to the ultimate finite synthesis called &quot;love&quot;. Even
though it is still a finite Ideal, one cannot experience it in
its purest form so long as one retains the conception of oneself
as a completely distinct, separate entity. This experience of
the death of self seems a necessary precursor.<br>

Gedoons, Part 35 of 91. 2nd of LOE.
Zodiacal King: Cadaamp. Ministers: 7772 Mundane association: India
Major (Southeast Asia and India east of the Ganges.)
<p>
Monday, December 04, 1995 9:30 PM
<p>
For a while I could see nothing except
vibrating lines of many colors filling my visual field; these
were like the visual effects that sometimes come when peaking
on LSD. They were accompanied by a sense of fragmentation also
similar to that of an acid peak.
<p>
Then I was looking down on southeast
Asia from the direction of India. The sigil was overlaid thereon.
The sigil started at about the location of Haiphong in Vietnam,
curled around the southern end of the region and northwards, ending
just east of the easternmost mouth of the Ganges. The Malaysian
peninsula was not included.
<p>
Now comes the image of a man, down on
his knees and with his head bent close to the ground. He is wearing
a coolie outfit or one of those pajama-like suits the Viet Cong
used to wear. But he does not seem to have Asiatic features; I
cannot place him in any ethnic group.
<p>
It is hard to tell what he is doing.
He seems to be sorting out tiny grains of something from the dirt;
he is picking up individual grains of rice and eating them. Bugs
also, and anything else that comes in front of his eyes. He does
not look up at all.
<p>
The image widens. I can see a truck
parked a short way away. It is piled high with sacks of rice;
one of these has a leak -- this is the source of the grains the
man seeks. It seems he could just stand up, walk over to the truck,
and take much more rice than he is finding on his knees. Why doesn't
he do so? Is he even aware that the truck is there?
<p>
He sits up straight for a moment, and
knee-walks a few feet down the road -- away from the truck. Then
he bends over again and goes back to his picking.
<p>
The voice speaks: 
<p>
&quot;One can become so accustomed to
one's routines of survival that one does not see riches even when
they are nearby, and free for the taking. One can become so accustomed
to hunger that a full stomach is not even imaginable, nor can
the means by which it can be gained. That which is reliable, though
it yields scant gain, is taken over the chances [it may have said
&quot;changes&quot; instead] that would bring more. 
<p>
&quot;So too in the spiritual quest,
one can get so used to one's routines of &quot;development&quot;
that one continues them even when they no longer produce good
results. When the culture is steeped in routines and ritual to
begin with, then the purpose of practices may be forgotten entirely,
and the practices be assumed to be the end in themselves. &quot;
<p>
I get side-images of monks in a monastery,
going through their daily rituals of work, worship, and meditation.
Everything is timed exactly; just so much time for work, so much
in the temple, so much in one's cell. Then doing it all over again.
Other images of the prayer-wheels that Tibetans like so much,
equally stylized, equally useless when the purpose is forgotten.
<p>
&quot;The intent of ritual activity
-- we do not mean the ceremonials of magick -- are to free the
mind from concern with the daily round of living. To free the
mind from the need to make decisions, to make efforts, that would
distract from the pursuit of the goal of enlightenment. But what
use, if the rituals are themselves so time-consuming that no time
is left for the mind to be free to roam? 
<p>
&quot;Inspiration, the descent of the
spirit, does not come when the mind is occupied, but when it is
without occupation; open, relaxed, attentive but not seeking.&quot;
<p>
The voice stops abruptly. The sense
of the speaker's presence is no longer there. Nor does any further
image appear. The power of the Part can still be sensed, however.

<p>
I wait for a while, simply focused and
ready, not seeking more. Then for a few moments, the shimmering
lines and the disorientation of the opening return. Then they
pass again. The voice continues, now seeming to come from a distance:

<p>
&quot;One can free the mind without
such ritualistic activity; it is a matter of careful judgment,
of examination of the details of life, and the elimination of
all those that are not essential. Then do the rest as the moment
demands, and take no thought for it beyond the moment of its accomplishment.
Nor be seeking forward in thought to the next task -- it shall
come in its own time, and be done when its time comes, not before.
Such is the way of the Taoist sages.
<p>
&quot;Let time become naught; let the
days cycle by as they will, and care not whether it be spring
or fall, summer or winter. Care not for the passage of the years;
make them invisible to your sight and thought. Do what is before
you when it is before you, and leave it when it is done. Out of
this comes a natural ordering of life, superior to any ritual
ordering.
<p>
&quot;And when the concerns of life
are so reduced to their essentials, then Time opens up in which
the spirit can come in, and the being is prepared for it to be
received. The myriad tiny moments that separated tasks before
now join together into larger moments, even days, when nothing
need be done except attend to the spirit. Tasks adjust themselves
naturally, when they have room to do so.
<p>
&quot;Now come you to the next of the
Parts; this one is done as well as needs be. Comment, and go on.
We are done.&quot;
<p>
I thank the voice, and end the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
Gedoons is the first of the Parts to
be governed by Cadaamp, the Zodiacal King of Virgo in the system
used for this work. The vision seems to be a general treatment
of the sign. The characteristics of Virgo are attention to detail,
and a love of routinized activity. This detail-consciousness often
comes at the expense of the wider view; routinization at the expense
of opportunities. The opening image of the man gleaning rice-grains
expresses this.
<p>
In Frater Achad's &quot;reformed&quot;
Tree of Life, the path of Virgo connects Hod, the sphere of the
intellect, with Geburah, the sphere of directed activity. It is
also one of the three vertical paths connecting the lowest triad
of the Tree with the middle triad. As such, it represents one
of the means used to move from the mundane-oriented region of
the Tree into the spiritually- and magickally-oriented region.
<p>
The intellect, the part of the mind
that deals with words and converts experience into word-groups,
is extremely sensitive to events. Everything we see, everything
that happens in our life, produces an immediate spate of activity
in the intellect, which often continues long after the event itself
is passed. We create descriptions of the event, play with inner
dialogs of how we <i>should</i> have reacted to it for best effect,
decide on contingency plans for future occurrences of similar
events, and so on. Anticipated events (and purely imaginary events)
produce equally furious activity, even though the events almost
never occur in the way we anticipate. 
<p>
The intent of the monkish lifestyle
is to reduce this activity of the intellect by taking away the
opportunity and need for it. &quot;Silencing the inner dialog&quot;,
as Casteneda puts it, is the first step towards becoming aware
of the spiritual world. When the person eschews possessions, there
is no need for concern with acquiring or keeping them. When the
person abandons status and recognition, family and society, social
affairs become much simpler. When basic survival is assured through
a minimum of communal work, or through begging, then many mundane
fears fall by the wayside. The intellect loses most of its usual
sources of stimulation. Those remaining minimum activities are
then converted into a routine, so that even they do not stimulate
the inner dialog very much.
<p>
But it is easy for certain personality
types to make such routine into ritual, and make the ritual an
end in itself, focusing on it instead of becoming unconscious
of it. Without a constant re-direction of the attention away from
the routine and towards the inner world, it becomes empty activity.

<p>
The &quot;Taoist&quot; view extolled
by the voice of the Part is a higher form of this principle, in
which even routine is abandoned. The activities of life and mind
become a direct reflection of the innate cycles of activity of
the spiritual self. The consciousness dwells in the present, and
as those energies of which it is an expression vary over time,
so does the focus of its attention. Everything is done as the
present moment dictates, with neither anticipation of possible
futures, nor mulling over of past events. Achieving this does
not constitute &quot;enlightenment&quot;, though one might get
that impression from certain famous texts. Rather, it is the perfection
of the relationship between action and thought on the one hand,
and the individual will, the &quot;atmic impulse&quot; on other.

Ambriol, Part 36 of 91. 3rd of LOE.
Zodiacal King: Ziracah. Ministers: 3391  Mundane association:
Orcheny (Islands in the marshes of the lower Tigris and Euphrates.)
Note: James shows a different, discontinuous sigil for this Part.
<p>
Thursday, December 07, 1995  1:44 PM
<p>
While practicing the visualization of
the sigil prior to the invocation, I heard an astral voice cry:
&quot;The Elixer! The wonderful Elixer!&quot; in tones of awe.
I was momentarily filled with a feeling of wonder, then it faded
again.
<p>
Invoked Ambriol according to the usual
procedure.
<p>
The center of the circle opened, and
below me I could see Australia. The sigil of the Part was overlaid
on it. The start of the sigil was around Darwin. It followed the
coast east to the opening of the big gulf, then jogged southwest
into the desert. The parallelogramatic section of the sigil enclosed
most of the Northern Territories and northern Queensland, roughly
contiguous with the watershed that drains into the gulf.
<p>
Now an image of The Star is overlaid
on the land and sky. My viewpoint revolves around so that I am
looking at the region from above the gulf. The water-carrier has
one foot on the gulf, the other on the land south of it; she pours
out water from her left-hand jug upon the mountains and hills
to the south, and it drains down through the watershed to the
gulf. She pours water from her other jug over the sea, and it
forms a typhoon, which stirs up the waters of the gulf and flings
them upwards.
<p>
Above her head a bright star appears.
It is not Polaris (as in previous visions) but Achernar, shining
with blue-white intensity. And it seems there is another water-carrier
among the stars above, and she pours down her water upon this
star, from whence it flows and meanders northwards until it reaches
the celestial equator near the Hunter's feet. There it enters
a lake surrounding the Hunter's foot; Rigel spins redly and its
heat vaporizes the water, which disappears into the background
of the sky.
<p>
Now the image of the earthly water-carrier
and her surroundings begins to waver, as if seen through disturbed
water; soon only the waves of the disturbance are visible. Simultaneously,
the river in the sky becomes more regular in shape, a series of
up-and-down strokes. The waves above and the waves below combine
and form into the glyph of Aquarius.
<p>
The voice speaks: &quot;As above, so
below. They are one; there is no separation between them, save
in the falsely discriminating minds of men. Why should the sky
not affect the Earth? And wherefore should not the Earth equally
affect the sky? They have run together since the beginnings of
Time, and all within their horizon is but a single realm, unbroken,
an un-hatched egg.&quot;
<p>
(I get an impression here that the waves
of the Aquarius sigil somehow represent the &quot;solve et coagula&quot;
formula in action. Each downward point of a wave is a condensation
of substance; each upward point is a dissolution of substance
into a vaporous state. Just so, the water condenses and falls
on the land; it flows to the sea and is again evaporated. Just
so, the clouds of gas in space condense into stars; these concentrate
until their heat is too great; then they explode their substance
into vapor again. 
<p>
(And each of the Earthly water-carrier's
jugs is one end of a process that contains several repetitions
of the formula; an additional polarity overlaid on the basic process.
So also the celestial river, running from Achernar to Rigel, is
a process containing multiple repetitions of the formula. What
this overlaid process might be, I do not yet know.)
<p>
The voice speaks again, answering my
thought: &quot;What else could it be, o man, but the distillation
of the wonderful Elixer, the essence of all things? And it is
all one process, above and below. So the waters of the world carry
with them the essences of the lands they pass through; these are
carried upwards in the evaporation to become one with the Aires.
Some condenses again with the rain, but other parts are carried
higher. And in the highest Aires are they boiled off of this world
by the power of the Sun, to become part of the great seas of space.
<p>
&quot;So too in the worlds of men; they
reincarnate ever, each time become more themselves, more their
own essence. At any point in time, some return again to the Earth;
others achieve a high enough place that they are released from
the bindings of this world into the greater universe. And what
happens then, is not for us to say; but the process continues
ever onwards.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Now think of what we have said
before: the release of a man from this world is the  true beginning
of his life, a life of freedom from all save self-defined limits.
There is nowhere barred to those who leave, nowhere they might
not pass. Those who travel the star-ways take from this world
their own distillation of its essence, and carry it with them
wherever they might pass. Thus is the Earth rejoined with that
realm from which she blocked her attention in a long-ago time.
With each such passing a tendril of her substance is carried along;
these bind to what they pass, and the links are re-made that once
were broken.
<p>
&quot;And in these links will the higher
process, that which takes place among the stars, eventually be
brought down to Earth again. The false division will be healed,
the separation in the minds of men destroyed forever. The illusion
that Here is not There [i.e., that the Earth is not part of the
Heavens] shall be overcome, and men once more pass freely from
realm to realm, even those who have not yet earned their passage
into the greater life.
<p>
&quot;Now go, and come again another
day, and you will see more, more clearly. We are done.&quot;
<p>
I ended the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
Achernar is the first star of the constellation
Eridanus, the River. It's name comes from an Arabic phrase meaning
&quot;end of the River&quot;. Whether it was supposed to be the
headwaters or the mouth is debatable; here it is the former. Rigel
in Orion lies very close to the other end of Eridanus. It is actually
a blue-white supergiant, not a red star as described here. But
the visible star is part of a four-star system composed of two
binaries; the complex orbits of these four might be likened to
a cosmic equivalent of the typhoon produced by the Earthly water-carrier.
<p>
The Achernar end of the River is close
to the Phoenix. The other end is at Orion. Orion lost his sight
and then regained it thanks to the rays of the Sun; the Phoenix
dies and is reborn. It seems to me that both might be an expression
of the principle being shown here.
<p>
Others of the voices have said that
the &quot;star-roads&quot; are endless, the travels upon them
never reach a final goal. Therefore this distillation process
must also be endless; the Elixer is never completed, but always
in process.
<p>
Sunday, December 10, 1995  12:50 PM
<p>
Invoked Ambriol according to the usual
procedure.
<p>
The night sky appears above the circle,
and then it seems that I am standing in the flood-plain of that
region described in the previous vision, hills to the south and
east, desert to the west, the great gulf to the north. And in
the sky, the sigil of the Part becomes one with Eridanus, though
they are nothing alike in shape; somehow there is an identity
between them.
<p>
And now I am in that sky-river, gliding
down it in a marvelous boat. The boat seems to be made of jewels
or stars itself, bound together with some kind of magick force.
It seems the essence of Night, that boat, and it passes through
places and times where no others could pass. It adapts, changing
its shape and nature as it moves, conforming to the qualities
of the spaces around it. 
<p>
In the bow of the boat stands the eldest
Set, in his form from before his demonification. He is also like
Night, and carries a myriad of stars within him. He bears a long
thin staff in his right hand, and in his left is a sphere that
is like an eye, and somehow also like a grail. He also seems to
change his nature as the boat moves along; his aura is never the
same from one moment to the next. Yet on some other level there
is continuity; adaptation and change are his nature.
<p>
There is something very confusing here;
at one moment it seems that the spaces change as we pass through
them, and at another that this god is changing the spaces. Or
perhaps he is creating them?
<p>
The voice speaks:
<p>
&quot;There is a subtle dance of powers
going on here, o mage; as there is for all those who travel the
star-roads. It is not like the Earth, where the changes man takes
upon him in incarnation are forced, to a great extent, by the
existing state of the world. Rather, here in the spaces of freedom
the world changes as the being who moves in it changes. Each new
potential manifested by a being instantly becomes one with the
existing state of the universe, becomes embodied in it with those
qualities already established. And the manifestation of those
qualities in space reflects back upon the traveler, causing additional
changes and adaptations in his nature. 
<p>
&quot;Thus there is a continual unfolding
of both universe and the being who travels; each takes on marvelous
new qualities, creates things previously unknown. And thus each
road is a river; not a fixed thing of earth, but a fluid, adaptable,
ever-changing flow. There are no guides here; how can there be
when each step and motion creates newness? There is no hierarchy
here, no rulership of one power by a greater power; how can there
be, when the attempt to rule changes the conditions as much as
any other action? Only voluntary cooperation among beings -- that
is, Love under Will -- allows them to be fellow-travelers for
a time, joining their creative powers in a dance of endless surprises.
<p>
&quot;Take you the bow position in this
boat of years, for a time, and see what happens.&quot;
<p>
I move to the front of the boat, and
in that motion become the god who stands there. I look forward.
After a time the boat passes into a distinct space, a sphere within
which certain qualities seem to maintain themselves over time.

<p>
In that space, passing by on the left
of the boat, I see my Temple of the Tablets. And below the boat,
in the relative terms of this space, I see a network of cubes,
the faces of each one connected to their nearest neighbors by
lines of light. These cubes are each a set of Tablets, like unto
those of the Enochian magick, but not identical. This network
extends down and away in every direction, seemingly endless. 
<p>
Then I see another Temple forward and
on the left; this one is of Fire. (The first was of Air.) And
looking far away to starboard, I see two more, in the other two
elements. Together they form a great square above the sea of cubes;
and as I move towards the midpoint between them all, another,
greater Temple forms within those bounds. It towers over the others
and seems to include them.
<p>
I reach the midpoint, and pass through
the central beam of power in that greater temple. It fills me
and seems to expand me for a moment. The boat seems caught in
an eddy, whirling around within the beam three or four times before
passing out of it again, and going on.
<p>
The boat quickly passes out of that
space and moves on. After a time, another thing comes closer out
of the surrounding space; this one is the Comselha pattern I devised
for the powers of the Tablets. It is like Oz in the old movie,
high, pointed towers, but in the middle of a circular plate. As
I move closer the space around me splits into three interrelated
parts. In one, the basic circular pattern is to be seen, my original
design. In another, &quot;above&quot; the first in some way, it
is the city that grew out of that design. And in the third, above
and larger than either of those, it seems an entire nation of
powers has formed upon that circular plan, each square of the
original design become a huge territory.
<p>
The boat passes out of this as well,
and back into the undifferentiated spaces again.
<p>
And the voice says: &quot;Though the
change is inevitable within the star-roads, yet one can see landmarks
there, creations that have gained a permanence of sorts in comparison
with their surroundings. These serve as reference points and points
of rendezvous for those who travel the roads. The ones that you
see are of course your own, which have gained such permanence;
there are many others, a few of which you have seen in your visions.
<p>
&quot;One can travel from landmark to
landmark, having confidence of arrival. Yet the paths between
are always different, always changing. And even these landmarks
change slowly, as those who arrive lend some of their own power
and experience to the permanent spaces. 
<p>
&quot;But there is joy in striking out
into the unknown, as well you know. One still encounters such
landmarks, but one never knows when or where they will appear.
And the blessing of surprise is added to the joy of going and
arriving.&quot;
<p>
While this was said, we passed by other
things. One like an upside-down ankh, the hole of which appeared
as a tunnel passing through spaces ordered in endless vertically-oriented
layers or planes. Another was a bow whose string vibrated in complex
wave-forms. Another was a cube whose inside was larger than its
outside. And others, too far away to see clearly.
<p>
The boat gave a sudden rocking motion,
and it was back in the stream of Eridanus, moving through the
sky towards Orion. All those other landmarks had vanished.
<p>
Looking down, it appeared that the &quot;water&quot;
of this stream was compose of souls, all being rushed along by
some unseen force. They did not appear disturbed or helpless;
rather there was a sense of partying, of travel for its own sake;
they appeared content with their circumstances. The overall flow
of souls was fairly constant, but one could distinguish groups
within the flow, marked by some common quality. The flow carried
them onwards, faster than the boat was moving.
<p>
&quot;Those who make the roads by their
travels are not the only ones who can travel them. Given the right
circumstances, any being may do so, but only in a passive way.
These others must follow the streams and currents previously laid
down; what they see along their way is not of their creation,
but the developing and elaborating result of a true Traveler's
work. And in doing so they too have a freedom of sorts; they are
not free of their own natures, but they are free of any given
world. Our Earth is a temporary exception, soon to be relieved
of that restriction.
<p>
&quot;These too are part of the wonderful
Elixer being distilled from the worlds; never forget that. Their
nature contributes as much to its quality at any time as do those
whose work is on higher levels, and is by their own will.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Now we have said enough. Comment
as you will, and go on to the next of the Parts. We believe you
will find it intriguing. We are done.&quot;
<p>
I ended the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
This vision returns to some very old
themes of my work. And from my own viewpoint, doesn't really reveal
much that is new about them. Much is promised, very little is
delivered. 
<p>
As described here, the &quot;star-roads&quot;
seem not much different from the traditional view of the &quot;astral
plane&quot;, which changes according to one's will, and according
to the unconscious impulses one projects upon it. Other visions
have in fact depicted them as a sort of super-astral, a plane
which is the Yesod of a Tree in which our entire Tree of Life
constitutes Malkuth. This meta-Yesod is supposedly the residence
of those beings who incarnate as planets, and many others of equal
scope. A vast society of such beings has been hinted at. Beyond
that, there is nothing more to say at this time.
<p>
The night-boat of Set seems to be a
complement to the boat of Ra. <br>

As I practiced visualizing the sigil,
I got an image of it overlaid on Greece. It began at the Bay of
Amvrakikos on the west side of the mainland, went south between
the Ionian Isles and the mainland, east through the Gulf of Corinth,
further east around Athens, then north and back west through the
Gulf of Evvoia (sp?). The Peleponesos was not included. 
<p>
Parnassus and Delphi were situated almost
exactly in the center of the sigil. It seemed to me that a thin
line of light was sticking upwards out of the mountain, and another
was sticking <i>down</i> into the Delphic temple. And these two
lines were somehow acting like the cables of an elevator -- they
remind me of the space elevator in Clarke's novel, though the
lines are nothing more than short segments. 
<p>
There was also an impression that there
was a hole in the Earth at the location of Delphi, with a short
conical upper section, leading to a narrow, cylindrical main section
below. There seemed no bottom to the hole.
<p>
I could get nothing more in this vision.
<p>
Seer's comments: 
<p>
The energy of this project seems to
be running out, as it did last year at about this time. Perhaps
this is a good place to stop for now. If the past two years are
any indication, the energy will come back some time after the
summer solstice.
