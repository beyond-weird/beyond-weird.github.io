<H5>Analysis of the First Enochian Key</H5>

<P>
(The following section fits into the &quot;Symbols and Visualizations&quot;
section of Enochian Temples at point 3. It was deleted from the
published version to save space.)
<P>
The first Enochian Key or Call is a recapitulation of the steps
by which the creator of the system brought it into being. The
Key follows the same macrocosmic-to-microcosmic progression used
in the example consecration ritual, but then supplements this
with a response from the microcosm directed at the macrocosm.
Note that the description of the downward current contains seven
significant phrases, suggesting the planets and sun, the macrocosm,
while the description of the response contains five significant
phrases, suggesting the four elements and elemental spirit, the
microcosm.
<H5>The Downward Current</H5>

<P>
1. Definition of context.
<P>
&quot;I reign over you, saith the God of Justice, in power exalted
above the firmaments of wrath.&quot; The &quot;firmaments of wrath&quot;
are the regions of activity within which creation takes place.
The god declares his full control over the act of creation, and
that as the creator he is outside the realm in which the act of
creation occurs.
<P>
2. Definition of the limits and qualities of the creation.
<P>
&quot;In Whose hands the Sun is as a sword, and the Moon as a
through-thrusting fire.&quot; An elegant equation, defining the
parameters of the creation. The god declares dominion over planetary
forces (Sun-Moon) and elemental forces (fire- air). He also declares
control over the two types of dualities: those in which one pole
is projective and the other responsive (Sun-Moon) and over those
in which two forces of similar polarity are balanced (fire-air).
Within the area of creation, the positive pole is attributed to
the element of swords, Air, and the anti-positive pole is attributed
to the element of Fire. This is reflected in the precedence followed
by the elements throughout the Tablets and Calls: Air first, then
Water, Earth, and Fire.
<P>
3. Gathering of the energies to be used.
<P>
&quot;Which measureth your garments in the midst of my vestures...&quot;
The word translated here as &quot;garments&quot; is used uniformly
to mean &quot;creation&quot; or &quot;being&quot; elsewhere in
the Keys. Another word is used for &quot;garments&quot; in the
next sentence of this same Key. Another word is also used for
&quot;midst&quot; further on in this Key. So the translation here
is questionable. A magickal image given to define this phrase
shows the scene through the god's eyes as he pulls endless threads
of living light out of a lamen on his chest.
<P>
4. Organization of the energies.
<P>
&quot;...and trussed you together as the palms of my hands.&quot;
The magickal image continues by showing the god gathering the
fibers of light into a bundle or cable. The god concentrates the
energies within the area of work in preparation for shaping.
<P>
5. Preparation of the material basis to which the energies are
attached.
<P>
&quot;Whose seats I garnished with the fire of gathering, which
beautified your garments with admiration.&quot; Having generated
the positive or spiritual pole of the creation, the god now looks
to the anti-positive or material pole. The &quot;seats&quot; are
the squares of the tablets in their two-dimensional form. The
god embodies a part of his will in the Tablets, defining the order
and place to which the spiritual energies will be attracted and
attached. When the energies are attached to the Tablets, the pattern
of will embodied in the Tablets extends back along their path
to the positive pole, conditioning all the perceptible expressions
(the &quot;garments&quot;) of the energies.
<P>
6. Definition of the modes of activity of the creation.
<P>
&quot;To whom I made a law to govern the holy ones,&quot; The
word translated as &quot;holy ones&quot; appears to derive from
the same root as the enochian words for &quot;fire&quot;, suggesting
that the holy ones are those who possess the spiritual will. The
god specifies the manner in which his creation will respond to
the mages and adepts.
<P>
7. Definition of the purpose of the the activity.
<P>
&quot;and delivered you a rod with the ark of knowledge.&quot;
The spirits of the Tablets are given authority over the dispensation
of the god's knowledge, including the power to initiate.
<H5>Returning Current</H5>

<P>
8. The energies respond to the creative will.
<P>
&quot;Moreover, you lifted up your voices and sware obedience
and faith...&quot; The connection between the two poles having
been made, and the conditions of their interaction being set,
the angels of the creation voice their response to the god, swearing
to continue to follow the god's will.
<P>
9. And affirm the success of the act of creation.
<P>
&quot;...to him that liveth and triumpheth,&quot; The spirits
of the Tablets affirm the existence of their creator by saying
that he lives, and affirm the success of the act of creation by
saying that he triumphs.
<P>
10. They affirm that the creator himself exists outside the realm
of creation...
<P>
&quot;whose beginning is not, nor end can not be,&quot; The spirits
affirm that the god exists entirely outside the creation's sphere
of activity. This phrase echoes the line beginning &quot;In whose
hands the Sun is...&quot; from a viewpoint inside the god's creation.
<P>
11. ...that his will is the source of their existence,
<P>
&quot;Which shineth as a flame in the midst of your palace...&quot;
Flame echoes the &quot;fire of gathering&quot;, and the palace
is the Great Tablet. The spirits affirm that they continue to
reflect the god's creative will.
<P>
12. and that he continues to regulate all of their activities.
<P>
&quot;and reigneth among you as the balance of righteousness and
truth.&quot; The god is the &quot;god of justice&quot;, corresponding
to Libra, the balances. Righteousness and Truth are Saturn and
Jupiter, who in turn are contraction and expansion, stability
and change, authority and responsibility, and numerous other complementary
pairs. The god reconciles all opposites. The terms also echo the
rod (active) and the ark of knowledge (receptive) of an earlier
phrase. It is also to be noted that in Achad's Tree, Jupiter and
Saturn are attributed to the paths leading respectively to Chokmah
and Binah from Kether. Their balance is the path of Shin, connecting
Kether with Tiphereth. Shin, Fire, is the &quot;flame in the midst
of your palace&quot;, and the beam of light in the center of the
Temple.
<P>
The echoing of the god's statements by the spirits of the tablets
also suggests that the conditions the god laid on the creation
as a whole are reflected in miniature within the creation. It
shall be shown that this is the case with the Tablets as we proceed.1
<H5>Concluding phrases</H5>

<P>
&quot;Move, therefor, show yourselves!
<P>
&quot;Open the mysteries of your creation!
<P>
&quot;For I am the servant of your god,
<P>
&quot;A true worshiper of the Highest!&quot;
<P>
In the remainder of the Key, the magician using it calls upon
the spirits to respond to him fully and openly. The word translated
here as &quot;servant&quot; might be better rendered as &quot;minister&quot;
or &quot;representative&quot;. The magician asserts that he has
a right to demand a response from the spirits because his acts
are in accord with the will of their creator.
