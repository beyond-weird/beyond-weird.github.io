<h5>The Nature of the Enochian Magickal System</h5>

<p>What most distinguishes the Enochian magickal system is that it is an artifact, a made
thing. Other systems attempt to describe the universe (or some part of it) as it is,
providing a framework which corresponds to observable natural structures and events,
attempting to work with forces in their natural states. This is not true of the Enochian;
like a product of human engineering it uses natural forces, but arranges and concentrates
them in ways that could never be produced through normal evolutionary processes. Every
aspect of its structure evinces the presence of deliberate creative intent behind its
existence. </p>

<p>It is equally clear to those who have used the system extensively that it is not the
product of human creativity, but of a being or beings possessing a much higher order of
perception and a much greater scope of action. The magickal beings who are bound into this
system are all (except the cacodemons) of at least the human level of development. Each
has a nature as deep and complex as any man, and each has an individual will as strong.
Further, the system appears to touch on every part of the magickal universe; no magician
has yet found any limit to its connections. Both of these facts demonstrate that the
origin of this magick must have been truly divine. No lesser source could possibly have
bound together the elements it contains; no lesser source could have made those elements
so instantly and perfectly responsive to the will of the user. </p>

<p>What is the purpose of this magickal machine? Experience shows that in some ways it is
like a computer system, in other ways like a communications network, a powerdistribution
grid, a means of transportation, and a trans-dimensional gate. Add to these the many
mundane tasks Dee believed could be accomplished through its use, and the Calls and
Tablets seem to be the Swiss Army Knife of magick. Whatever the magician wants to use it
for, it can accomplish; sometimes that accomplishment requires using it in ways not
intended, but it works nonetheless. </p>

<p>But however we think of it, we are likely to be wrong. This system has connections
encompassing more of the universe than our own minds can grasp; thus, whatever our
conception, it will not adequately reflect the reality. It is certain that even as we use
it for our own purposes, it affects us in ways we do not intend. There are few magicians
who have used it for any length of time who have not discovered its &quot;Trojan
Horse&quot; aspect: It lures the magician with the promise of power and glory; after he
has been drawn in, he finds he has irrevocably committed himself to the work of evolution.
It is equally certain that our actions are contributing to many other purposes on levels
greater in scope than our own. </p>

<p>From the standpoint of human magicians, I find it best to think of the Enochian magick
as an educational tool, one suited for training those who are in the process of evolving
into gods. It concentrates a great deal of knowledge into a compact and readily available
form, and allows students to extend their explorations in whatever directions suit their
natures and interests. It provides the instrumentality for students to test their
understanding of that knowledge, and gives instant and appropriate feedback to their
efforts. Further, as the students' abilities and comprehension expand, the system expands
with them, opening up new realms for exploration, eventually leading them into realms they
could not have imagined at the start of their work. </p>

<p>Aside from its inherent and unavoidable mystery, there is a great deal that is not
understood about the use of the system. The original records of Dee's works are spare in
their explanations, and contain ambiguities and contradictions sufficient to confuse the
most thorough and insightful scholar. Magicians in later times have attempted to resolve
these questions, sometimes by experiment, other times by fiat. Their efforts have often
served only to further confuse the issues. Much of this chapter, and the next, is intended
to point out these ambiguities, and where possible, to offer a practical resolution. </p>

<p>The basic system consists of: 

<ul>
  <li>Forty-eight &quot;Keys&quot; or &quot;Calls&quot;, invocations in an &quot;angelic&quot;
    language. Thirty of these are identical except for a single word. </li>
  <li>The Great Table, containing the Tablets of the Elements and a cross binding them
    together, which is sometimes formulated as a fifth Tablet called the Tablet of Union. The
    Table is built out of the names of a hierarchy of angelic offices, put together in a
    systematic framework. </li>
  <li>The Book of Earthly Knowledge and Victory, containing the names of the thirty
    &quot;Aethyrs&quot;- spiritual counterparts of various earthly regions - along with the
    names and sigils of the governors of each Aethyr and certain other information relating to
    them. The names and sigils of the governors are also derived from the Great Table, but in
    such a manner that no two of them cover an area of the same shape in the same sequence. </li>
  <li>The Heptarchia Mystica, a complex system of planetary magick which does not appear to be
    directly related to the foregoing parts. </li>
  <li>In creating the Enochian Temples, we will be dealing with only the first two of these
    four parts. </li>
</ul>

<p>Among the Calls, two are of a general nature, and serve to define the polarity within
which the system operates. The next sixteen invoke the elements and the sub-elements of
the Tablets. The remaining Calls, which differ only in one word, are used to invoke the
governors of the Aethyrs. </p>

<h5>The Divine Calls</h5>

<p>In the magickal universe, all things appear to exist as the product of the tension
between two extremes, a &quot;divine&quot; pole and a &quot;material&quot; pole. This is
true of the Enochian system as well; the First and Second Calls serve to invoke and define
the specific polarity within which the rest of the system exists. Despite the appellation
&quot;material,&quot; both Calls invoke forces which act from outside the region in which
the sixteen elemental Calls are active. An examination of the text of these Calls will
provide some clues upon which our intuition can work to understand the origins of the
system. </p>

<p>The first Enochian Call is a recapitulation of the steps by which the creator of the
system brought it into being. As such contains the entire Enochian system within itself in
symbolic form. It invokes the highest powers present within the system, and indirectly
invokes the system's creator. </p>

<p>The Call follows the path of creation from the macrocosm to the microcosm, then follows
the return current in the form of a response from the microcosm directed at the macrocosm.
Note that the description of the downward current contains seven significant phrases,
suggesting the planets and sun, the macrocosm, while the description of the response
contains five significant phrases, suggesting the four elements and elemental spirit, the
pentagram, and the microcosm. </p>

<p>Readers will note that the Call also describes the basic elements of a magickal
ceremony. The pattern shown might be adopted as a generalized ritual formula for works
both inside and outside the Enochian system. </p>

<h5>The Downward Current</h5>

<p>1. The Creator </p>

<p>&quot;I reign over you, saith the God of Justice, in power exalted above the firmaments
of wrath.&quot; </p>

<p>The creator declares his control over the forces to be used in his creation. He then
states his own nature, and declares that he is working from above or outside the realm in
which the creation takes place and is not subject to the conditions within that realm. </p>

<p>2. Definition of the limits and qualities to be used in the creation. </p>

<p>&quot;In Whose hands the Sun is as a sword, and the Moon as a through-thrusting
fire.&quot; </p>

<p>This elegant equation defines the general parameters of the creation. The god declares
his dominion over planetary forces (Sun-Moon) and elemental forces (fire-air). He also
declares control over the two types of dualities: those in which one pole is projective
and the other responsive (SunMoon) and over those in which two forces of similar polarity
are balanced (fire-air). Within the area of creation, the positive pole is attributed to
the element of swords, Air, and the anti-positive pole is attributed to the element of
Fire. This is reflected in the precedence followed by the elements throughout the Tablets
and Calls: Air first, then Water and Earth, ending with Fire. </p>

<p>3. Assembling of the energies to be used. </p>

<p>&quot;Which measureth your garments in the midst of my vestures...&quot; </p>

<p>The word translated here as &quot;garments&quot; is used uniformly to mean
&quot;creation&quot; or &quot;being&quot; elsewhere in the Calls. Another word is used for
&quot;garments&quot; in the next sen tence of this same Call. Another word is also used
for &quot;midst&quot; further on in this Call. So the translation here is probably
poetically true but not accurately literal. </p>

<p>Garments and vestures are almost the same thing; vestures are garments used in magickal
or churchly ritual, and therefor are themselves holy. They are intended to show the
assumed nature the magician is taking on for the work, or to indicate the purpose of the
work. The implication here is that the created beings are a direct expression of the will
of the creator. </p>

<p>A magickal image given by the angels to define this phrase shows the scene through the
god's eyes as he pulls endless threads of living light out of a lamen embroidered on the
front of his robes. In human magick this stage would be equivalent to a general invocation
of the forces to be used in the work. </p>

<p>4. Organization of the energies. </p>

<p>&quot;...and trussed you together as the palms of my hands.&quot; </p>

<p>The magickal image continues by showing the god gathering the fibers of light into a
bundle or cable. The creator takes the materials previously gathered, and brings them
together in a concentrated form. A human magician does this when he wills the invoked
forces to focus in his magical circle, or visualizes them gathering around him. </p>

<p>5. Preparation of the material basis of the work. </p>

<p>&quot;Whose seats I garnished with the fire of gathering, which beautified your
garments with admiration.&quot; </p>

<p>Having generated the positive or spiritual pole of the creation, the god now looks to
the anti-positive or material pole. The &quot;seats&quot; are the squares of the tablets.
The god embodies a part of his will in the Tablets, defining the order and place to which
the spiritual energies will be at tracted and attached. When the energies are attached to
the Tablets, the pattern of will embodied in the Tablets extends back along their path to
the positive pole, conditioning all the perceptible expressions (the &quot;garments&quot;)
of the energies. It is only in this joining of the spiritual force and the material basis
that the work is accomplished. These two together create a third thing, partaking of both
their natures but distinct from either, possessing its own life and powers. </p>

<p>Every magickal work requires a material symbol to which the invoked forces can be
attached. In theurgical work this is usually the magician himself, or someone the magician
is initiating. In evocatory work it is the Triangle of Evocation. For most other works it
is a talisman of some sort, which the magician prepares by purifying with fire and water,
symbolized here by the &quot;garnishing with fire&quot; and the &quot;beautification&quot;
of the seats. (It should be noted that from the standpoint of the Enochian god, the astral
and mental levels are just as &quot;material&quot; as the physical world.) </p>

<p>In the Enochian magick, the Great Table is the talisman to which all the energies have
been attached, and every copy of the Table (or any part of it) also possesses the same
connections through the Laws of Correspondences or Similarity. Even pictures of the
Tablets in mass-produced books will show evidence of the Angelic powers to astral sight,
and the intensity of the power will be seen to grow when even mild and occasional
attention is given to the picture. </p>

<p>6. Definition of the modes of activity of the creation. </p>

<p>&quot;To whom I made a law to govern the holy ones,&quot; </p>

<p>The &quot;holy ones&quot; are the angels of the Tablets. The creator here declares that
he has given them specific rules by which they must act. In human magick, this would be
equivalent to the Charge to the Spirits, by which the magician tells them of the way in
which he wants them to behave. </p>

<p>7. Definition of the purpose of the activity. </p>

<p>&quot;and delivered you a rod with the ark of knowledge.&quot; </p>

<p>The rod is the symbol of active power, the ark a receptacle for storage. So the
Enochian system is both a container from which knowledge can be drawn, but also a means by
which that knowledge can be put to use. </p>

<h5>Returning Current</h5>

<p>The creations here respond to their creator, hailing him in terms which express their
own natures -- in this case the four elements and their fifth, binding, element of spirit.
Thus they affirm that the work has been properly accomplished. </p>

<p>&quot;Moreover, you lifted up your voices and sware obedience and faith...&quot; </p>

<p>The connection between the two poles having been made, and the conditions of their
interaction being set, the angels of the creation voice their response to the god,
swearing to continue to follow the god's will. Obedience and faith are qualities of the
Element of Earth in the Enochian system. </p>

<p>&quot;...to him that liveth and triumpheth,&quot; </p>

<p>The spirits of the Tablets affirm the existence of their creator by saying that he
lives, and affirm the success of the act of creation by saying that he triumphs. Life or
livingness is a characteristic of Water. </p>

<p>&quot;whose beginning is not, nor end can not be,&quot; </p>

<p>The spirits affirm that the god exists entirely outside the creation's sphere of
activity. This phrase echoes the line beginning &quot;In whose hands the Sun is...&quot;
from a view point inside the god's creation. Endlessness or pervasiveness are
characteristics of the Element of Air. </p>

<p>&quot;Which shineth as a flame in the midst of your palace...&quot; </p>

<p>Flame echoes the &quot;fire of gathering&quot;, and the palace is the Great Tablet. The
spirits affirm that they continue to reflect the god's creative will. And in the
construction of the complete Temple, this phrase is literally true as well; the God,
echoed into a Temple of the Tablet in the form of the Elemental King, creates a brilliant,
burning beam which illuminates the Temple from within. </p>

<p>&quot;and reigneth among you as the balance of righteousness and truth.&quot; </p>

<p>Reigning is the function of a king, and the magickal image of a king corresponds to the
sphere of Tiphereth or Sol in the Cabala. This sphere also traditionally acts as the
&quot;spirit&quot; with respect to the four lower spheres, which are considered to
represent the four elements. </p>

<p>The god is the &quot;god of justice&quot;, corresponding to Libra, the balances.
Righteousness and Truth are Saturn and Jupiter, who in turn are contraction and expansion,
sta bility and change, authority and responsibility, and numer ous other complementary
pairs. The god reconciles all oppo sites. The terms also echo the rod (active) and the ark
of knowledge (receptive) of an earlier phrase. It is also to be noted that in Achad's
Tree, Jupiter and Saturn are at tributed to the paths leading respectively to Chokmah and
Bi nah from Kether. Their balance is the path of Shin (Fire), connecting Kether with
Tiphereth. </p>

<p>The echoing of the god's statements by the spirits of the tablets also suggests that
the conditions the god laid on the creation as a whole are reflected in miniature within
the creation. It shall be shown that this is the case with the Tablets as we proceed. </p>

<h5>Concluding phrases</h5>

<p>&quot;Move, therefor, show yourselves! </p>

<p>&quot;Open the mysteries of your creation! &quot;For I am the servant of your god,
&quot;A true worshiper of the Highest!&quot; </p>

<p>In the remainder of the Call, the magician using it calls upon the spirits to respond
to him fully and openly. The word translated here as &quot;servant&quot; might be better
ren dered as &quot;minister&quot; or &quot;representative&quot;. The magician as serts
that he has a right to expect a response from the spirits because his acts are in accord
with the will of their creator. </p>

<p>Elsewhere in Dee's records, it is said that the angels are bound by their covenant with
God to render obedient and faithful service to the magician, just as if the magician were
identical with the creator. Since the Call is spoken in the first person, the magician who
uses it is effectively taking on the role of the Creator, invoking that being's power into
himself. It is only in these last few lines that the magician drops back into his own
persona, and that only to affirm specifically the identity between himself and the
creator. </p>

<p>Where the system is being used for initiatory purposes, or for purposes of astral
exploration, it is best to use this Call before using any of the elemental Calls. In the
work of building the Temples of the Tablets, this Call can be used at any time. </p>

<p>The purpose of the Second Call is not surely known. I have conducted many experiments
to determine its proper use, without attaining results that would unequivocally
demonstrate what that use should be. The best that can be said is that this Call appears
to invoke the foursquare structural framework of the Tablets, the &quot;form&quot; aspect
as opposed to the spiritual essence invoked by the First Call. Angels invoked using this
Call with one of the elemental Calls express much less of their nature as individuals.
They act more as functionaries or bureaucrats, cogs in the machine of the angelic
hierarchy. The energies that they manifest are more raw, more natural or earthy than those
they manifest without it. </p>

<p>The content of the Second Call is much simpler than that of the first. It defines a
second aspect of the divine power, one which is still more holy than the powers of the
Calls that follow, but which specifically has control over the four elements, binding them
into an exact, fixed structure. </p>

<p>&quot;Can the Wings of the Winds understand your voices of wonder?&quot; </p>

<p>The Call opens by questioning whether the &quot;Wings of the Winds&quot;-- the Angels
of Air, highest of the strictly elemental angels -- are capable of comprehending the
powers being invoked here. The implication is that they are not and that, like the powers
invoked by the First Call, these are of a higher order than those. </p>

<p>&quot;Oh you, the second of the first,&quot; </p>

<p>Throughout the Calls, &quot;the first&quot; refers to the creator. The powers here are
a second aspect being manifested by the creator. The next five lines give these powers
specific control over the elemental framework of the Tablets. </p>

<p>&quot;Whom the burning flames have framed within the depths of my Jaws,&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;whom I have prepared as Cups for a wedding, or flowers in their beauty for the
Chamber of righteousness.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Stronger are your feet than the barren stone:&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;And mightier are your voices than the manifold winds.&quot; &quot;You have become
a building such as is not, save in the mind of the all-powerful.&quot; </p>

<p>Again we see the fivefold elemental pattern seen in the response section of the First
Call. But here the symbol of spirit is not the spirit itself, but a building, a structure
or form, created by the will of the divine. The use of the word &quot;palace&quot; in the
first Call, and of &quot;building&quot; here, strongly implies that in at least one of
their manifestations, these powers create a three-dimensional or higher-dimensional
structure. The Temples of the Tablets are one of these higher-dimensional forms. </p>

<p>As a general rule, the Second Call should never be used in the same session as the
First Call. Doing so exaggerates the tensions between the two poles, pulling the angels
and their powers in two different directions, reducing their ability to manifest either
side of their natures clearly. It can also stimulate an unpleasant mental strabismus in
the magician who tries it. </p>

<h5>The Elemental Calls and the Spherical Cosmology</h5>

<p>The Third through Sixth Calls are general invocations of the four elements, and also
serve as invocations of the four Lesser Angles in which the elements are not intermixed.
The Seventh through Eighteenth Calls are invocations of the remaining Lesser Angles, each
of which has a dual elemental nature. While we will not analyze the individual Calls in
detail, there are certain patterns which should be noted as demonstrating the cosmological
structure behind the Enochian system. </p>

<p>Careful analysis of the two divine and sixteen elemental Calls reveals that a definite
form of hierarchy or relative status is being expressed. This is a vertical hierarchy, in
which the powers are ranked one below the other, with the powers of Air highest, followed
by the other three &quot;pure&quot; elements and the dual-attribute angles in the sequence
defined by their respective Calls. The way in which this hierarchy is expressed in the
calls suggests that in this form, the elements form a sequence of concentric circles or
spheres around the earth, going from outermost to innermost in the sequence in which the
Calls are numbered. </p>

<p>In Dee's records, a similar sphericity is explicitly attributed to the Thirty Aethyrs,
and to the Divine Heptarchy. And (as shall be shown in the next chapter) the spherical
cosmology also provides one of the keys to a new, well-ordered and pragmatically reliable
set of attributes for the squares of the Elemental Tablets. Thus it may be that the
seemingly diverse elements of the Heptarchic and Enochian systems are united through an
underlying connection to this cosmological model. </p>

<p>The system of concentric spheres was the standard cosmological model of Dee's time, as
it had been since at least the time of Aristotle. Copernicus had only recently died, and
Galileo had not yet done the work that would eventually lead to general acceptance of a
heliocentric cosmos. And unlike modern cosmology, there was no division between the
evidence of physics and the teachings of religion; the model applied equally to the
observable world and the invisible world of the spirit. At the center of all was the
Earth, the lowest realm upon which all other influences descended. At the outside
surrounding all was the sphere of the zodiac and fixed stars, beyond which lay the realms
of God. Between these inner and outer spheres were others of an increasingly divine
character, some having visible appearances such as the planets, others invisible and
inhabited by various orders of divine and angelic beings. </p>

<p>Diagrams illustrating this cosmology were common in both religious and natural
philosophy texts; practically every group of things -- real or imagined -- that evidenced
some sort of order was converted into the system at one time or another. It was very
common for medieval grimoires (especially those concerned with Angel Magick) to represent
the beings they dealt with as occupying concentric spheres in celestial space. </p>

<p>There is no doubt that Dee, one of the most widely-read men of his time, saw such
diagrams many times and absorbed the principles involved as a matter of course. Neither
should we be surprised that those who gave the Enochian system to Dee and Kelly followed
the same system; they had to work, to an extent, within the conceptual limitations of
those to whom they were speaking. </p>

<p>In order to establish the concentric system as relevant to the Calls two things must be
demonstrated. First, that there is a sequentiality in the Calls, i.e., that the numbering
of the Calls is not arbitrary but reflects an intentional sequentiality in their content.
Second, that the end-points of the sequence can be connected by internal evidence to the
outermost and innermost spheres of the concentric system. </p>

<p>It is relatively easy to establish that the content of the Calls reflects a sequential
nature. Within the Calls are three groups. In the first group, the sequentiality is stated
explicitly, by reference to preceding calls. In the second group, the sequentiality is
shown by inclusion of successive directions in the Calls, going clockwise from the East.
The final group is connected by the fact that each Call contains a special name of God.
Table 1 shows the complete structure of these connections. Note that the last Call in each
group is also the first Call in the next group, so that there is a direct connection
between them. </p>

            Table 1. Connections between the Elemental Calls.
</pre>

<p>In the first group, we have connections demonstrated by the quotations listed. It is
instructive to note that while the Second Call refers to the First Call and the Third, the
Third Call refers only to the First. As was shown earlier the Second Call, while divine in
nature, creates the structure or form in which the powers of the system are contained. The
subsequent Calls invoke the powers it contains, and so it can be considered to be
partially outside the sequence. </p>

<p>In the second group, the directions are listed in sequence clockwise from the East
going one and a half times around the circle until the movement is brought to a halt by a
repetition of the direction South. If the sequence were extended backwards to cover the
four Calls of the pure elements, then the direction mentioned in the Call for Water is in
its proper place in the sequence. </p>

<p>In the final group the connection is clear, but the sequentiality is not obvious. It
seems as if we have five different but equally violent natures being expressed, and that
these only come to rest and balance, producing joy, in the last Call. One can argue that
the first five of these Calls all eventually move into the last, but justifying a sequence
among them is difficult. </p>

<p>But note the qualities of the three groups. The members of the first group are all
related (directly or by reference) to Time, Duration, or Eternity. The members of the
second group all express the principle of Space. The final group expresses the principle
of Activity or Motion, at first violent and unbalanced but finally coming into balance.
Each principle is dependent on the one preceding it; Space is meaningless if there is no
duration; motion is impossible without Time in which it can happen, and Space in which it
can occur. So on a slightly larger scale the final group can be said to express part of
the overall sequential nature of the Calls. </p>

<p>In order to demonstrate the connections between the Calls and the concentric spheres
cosmology, we need only look at the two Calls that would be on the spheres at the extremes
of that structure. The first two Calls, being divine in nature, must be considered as
operating &quot;outside&quot;, in the realms of God. The first of the Calls which might
lie within the spheres would thus be the Third. </p>

<p>The Third Call begins: </p>

<p>&quot;Behold, sayeth your God, I am a Circle on Whose hands stand 12 Kingdoms.&quot; </p>

<p>The god who speaks is outside the spheres of existence. He acts upon those spheres
through the outermost, representing the circle of the zodiac and the sphere of the fixed
stars. Further on the god indicates that the creatures of Air partially partake of the
nature of that sphere: </p>

<p>&quot;In the first I made you stewards, and placed you in seats 12 of government,
giving unto every one of you power successively over 456, the true ages of time,&quot; </p>

<p>Their twelve seats reflect the twelve signs. And they have power over the ages of time,
which ages (in magickal and astrological lore) are determined by the precession of the
equinoxes through the signs. In contrast, the creatures of the Fourth Call are given power
over the &quot;numbers of time,&quot; the means by which time is counted or measured,
which might obliquely relate to the planets and the neverrepeating patterns they take as
time progresses. The creatures of the Fifth Call are given power over the &quot;ends and
contents of time&quot;, the &quot;earthy&quot; physical objects which exist and have
finite duration within time. </p>

<p>&quot;Thus you are become the skirts of Justice and Truth.&quot; </p>

<p>The God of the Enochian system is the &quot;God of Justice&quot;, who reigns among the
creatures of the Calls as &quot;the balance of righteousness and truth.&quot; The Enochian
words for &quot;justice&quot; and &quot;righteousness&quot; are clearly variations on the
same root, so the God is equally &quot;justice and truth&quot;. &quot;Skirts&quot; can be
interpreted either as the circular &quot;hem&quot; of God's garment, or as the circular
border or margin of the region under the God's direct control. In either case it again
establishes that the creatures of Air are those closest to the divine regions among the
Calls. </p>

<p>So we have a fairly clear connection between the Third Call and the outermost sphere of
the concentric cosmology, the sphere of the fixed stars. The connection to the innermost
sphere, that of the Earth, is stated explicitly in the last of elemental Calls, the
eighteenth. </p>

<p>&quot;Thou mighty light and burning flame of comfort, which openest the glory of God to
the center of the earth...&quot; </p>

<p>The center of the Earth is the center of the Cosmic Onion, the opposite extreme to the
sphere of the fixed stars. The two Calls that begin and end the elemental Calls are
clearly associated with the two extremes of the concentric cosmology. And as was
previously shown, there is a definite sequentiality in the Calls between them. It is not
unreasonable to believe that those other Calls are intended to occupy their own spheres
between the two ends. </p>

<p>This idea is further reinforced by the fact that the Aethyrs were also shown in Dee's
records as occupying concentric spheres around the Earth. The 91 governors of the Aethyrs
have their names formed from the Great Table, just as do the angels and powers who govern
the regions controlled by the elemental Calls. Since the two sets of names cover the same
&quot;territory&quot; in their different fashions, it is reasonable to think that the
elemental Calls and the Aethyric Calls are actually two different ways of looking at that
same territory, and that the concentric spheres explicitly applied to the latter group
also apply to the former. </p>

<p>Additionally, the sequencing of the four elements in the Enochian scheme -- Fire
lowest, then Earth, Water, and Air -- has a direct relation to the spherical layering
found in the physical body of the Earth. The core of the planet is intensely hot and
molten; so much so that the heat escaping from the core contributes significantly to
maintaining the temperatures necessary for life to exist here. On top of this core of fire
floats the crust, the solid, &quot;earthy&quot; portion. The watery portion lies on top of
the crust, and the air surrounds it all. </p>

<p>The consequence of this correlation between the Calls and the medieval cosmology is
that we cannot assume, as many have, that the elemental Calls and their corresponding
Tablet regions are in some way limited to action within the lower, purely elemental
reaches of the magickal universe. Nor can we deny that they, as much as the Aethyrs,
represent a path of initiation, a path between the Earth and the heavens. As will be shown
in the following chapter, the Hierarchies of the Tablets can also be neatly fit into the
concentric view of creation, reinforcing this principle. The Calls, Tablets, and Aethyrs
are simply three different &quot;maps&quot; superimposed on a single underlying sphere of
existence. </p>

<p>With our modern knowledge of the universe, the concentric cosmology of the Enochian
system cannot be accepted on the same terms as it would have been by a man of Dee's time.
However, with some slight modifications it can still be considered valid for spiritual
purposes, as well as being in general (but not detailed) accord with the physical facts. </p>

<p>At various levels of existence we find entities that give the appearance of having a
centralized consciousness, or a focus that unifies the action of its various parts. Humans
and other living beings, planets, and stars all exhibit this characteristic. Such beings
also exhibit concentric spherical layerings when they are viewed whole. Humans have a
solid core, the body, which is surrounded by a cloud of water vapor and various chemicals
created by the body; they have a slightly larger &quot;aura&quot; of electromagnetic
fields, and an even larger aura of heat radiation. The planet has the four layers
mentioned above, and additional layers composed of magnetic fields and gravitational pull.
Similarly for the Sun. </p>

<p>We can come to some correspondence between the Enochian cosmological model and modern
knowledge by assuming that the system's concentric layers do not correspond to the entire
universe, as a medieval man would have believed, but instead correspond to layers in the
magickal being of the planet on which we live. </p>

<p>The outer &quot;divine&quot; layers would correspond to those layers where the
influence of the planet intermixes with the influences of its environment in the Solar
system. Spiritually, these would be the layers in which the consciousness inhabiting and
enlivening the planet resides, interacting with the other planets and the larger universe
on its own terms. The elemental layers would then correspond to the various portions of
its internal activity. </p>

<p>We know now that the signs of the zodiac are not direct influences of the real stars in
our sky, but rather are expressions of the Earth's changing relationship to the Sun over
the course of its yearly orbit. The sun being the most powerful entity on the next higher
scale of existence, the signs would still be appropriate as expressions of the highest
power manifesting within our world. The other planets, having a less powerful and
immediate influence, would act within the general conditioning set by the
terrestrial-solar relationship, and would still be considered to have a &quot;lower&quot;
place in this world's psychic scheme. Both modern and medieval astrologers determine the
relative &quot;divinity&quot; and power of the planets by their apparent rate of motion as
seen from the Earth's surface; there is no reason for changing anything in that area. And
within these external influences the four subjective &quot;elements&quot; still enact
their ever-changing dance. </p>

<p>We have lost nothing by narrowing the scope of the old cosmology. Indeed, we have
gained by doing so. In the old view the entire universe was contained within the spherical
scheme. It was a tidy cosmos, in which everything had its place and there were no
surprises. Once one understood the basic structure, one had understood everything; once
understanding was complete, wise action was inevitable; and having understood and acted
wisely, one was only a step away from the divinity. </p>

<p>All the factors of the old cosmology are still present, but with a difference. Where
the medieval universe was small enough that its creator could conceivably give attention
to every event within it, in modern understanding the universe is so immense that any
being capable of encompassing the whole could not possibly encompass all of the details
occurring within it. If there is a god who gives its attention to this world, as does the
god of the Enochian system, it must be relatively local in scope and influence. This
raises the possibility -- rather, the inevitability -that within the universe there are
other places where other gods work out schemes of creation different from our own. If we
achieve union with the local creator, we find that beyond him still lies a limitless arena
in which anything imaginable and unimaginable can occur. </p>

<p>And every local creation must interact with its environment on a variety of levels;
nothing stands alone; nothing exists totally apart. There must be links between our own
system and many of those other spheres. This is as true of the Enochian universe as it is
of the physical universe. The Temples of the Tablets provide (among their several uses) a
means by which such connections can be discovered and the connected spheres opened to our
exploration.1 </p>
