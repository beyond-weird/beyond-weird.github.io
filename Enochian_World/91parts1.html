Occodon, Part 1 of 91, 1st of LIL. Zodiacal
king: Zarzilg  Mundane association: Egypt. 
<p>
I recited the Call of the Aethyrs for
LIL, and invoked the part named OCCODON, and its 7209 resident
ministers, by the power of the zodiacal king Zarzilg. At first
the response was very faint, barely perceptible. I repeated the
invocation of the various names, and it increased slightly but
still did not seem inclined to generate any sort of image.
<p>
Thinking of images that might ground
and manifest this power, a picture of the pyramids of Giza suddenly
came into my vision with power and certainty. It was a view from
the west, with Cairo hidden in the valley behind them, and the
sphinx invisible somewhere beyond the left edge of the view. The
green of the Nile cannot be seen; there is nothing but sand. A
voice spoke:
<p>
&quot;In ancient times it was said that
the world began out of the division of the Waters; and so it was.
The primal waters divided out of themselves a portion of themselves,
a reflection; these became the 'waters below' as the primal waters,
taking on a role in relation to them, became the 'waters above'.
<p>
&quot;Thus was born the essential division
of finite existence; and within that first division did divisions
multiply. Each 'above' had its 'below'; each 'left' had its 'right';
each 'behind' had its 'before'. And each division generated more
divisions, until the world was shattered into a myriad of parts,
each unique, each without comparison to the others, yet meaningless
except when in relation to them.
<p>
&quot;Thus also, these parts of the
Earth which you explore begin not with unity, but with division;
there is nothing but division within them, division and perpetual
change. For that which is below and that which is above are confounded
in the curse of god; intermixed, intertwined until none can know
which is the greater and which the true lesser.&quot;
<p>
A flashing image here of the universe
as a multitude of independent particles, with energies flashing
between them. Some of these &quot;particles&quot; appeared as
great as planets or stars, others more minute than the smallest
quark, and with every range in between. The energies moved in
every direction, from small to large, large to small, and back
and forth among the middle sizes. It seemed that a tiny particle
was just as capable of influencing one of the &quot;greater&quot;
particles as those larger were of influencing it; there was no
clear hierarchy among them. 
<p>
Now the pyramid image returns, and my
viewpoint moves back away from it. A single pyramid remains visible,
and it becomes apparent that the landscape in which it sits is
a small chunk out of the Earth's surface, floating free in space.
Magritte could have easily painted this scene. 
<p>
Above the chunk of Earth a starry night-sky
is visible, color-tinged white pinpoints on a deep blue background.
But below the Earth there is nothing but a blackness, entirely
without perceptible features. A blackness which is utterly negative,
which does not absorb the finite into itself (as does the great
sea of the Supernals, and the greater sea of which it is the reflection)
but which <i>cancels</i> it, makes it not to be by saying &quot;no&quot;
to all its characteristics.
<p>
For a moment a tremendous stress builds
between the sky and the lower blackness. An electric current builds
between them, and suddenly becomes visible as twin lightning bolts
vibrating in place between the sky and the darkness. After a moment
the chunk of Earth vanishes from the middle of the scene, and
for a moment the planes of sky and darkness and the twin bolts
become the glyph of Gemini. Then the glyph transforms itself into
a view of Egypt seen from orbit. The top bar of the glyph becomes
the shore of Lake Victoria; the lower bar becomes the shore of
the Mediterranean Sea; and the twin pillars or bolts become the
sandy wastes that border the Nile Valley on either side. 
<p>
&quot;Thus is the world the center of
division; finite life and existence can have their day only within
the bounds of these great divisions of power, in the central area
where all the opposites mix in varied proportions. Move too far
towards the upper waters, and one returns to them, sacrificing
finite existence for the greater; move too far towards the lower
waters and one dissolves in their negation, becomes <i>not</i>.
Move too far towards any horizontal extreme between them and one
perishes in the dry death of false singularity. 
<p>
&quot;And thus also is this division
reflected in the Call of the Aethyrs, which has been called the
Curse of God; for there is no center within the world, no point
where one may become balanced and still without end. No point
can remain balanced, for the balance is ever changing, ever moving;
and the various parts pass in turn over the hypothetical point
of balance, seeming for a moment to be the center but then passing
out again into an unbalanced state.
<p>
&quot;So as well is the mind of Man.
The 'self', the seeming 'I' that inhabits the being is truly not
the center. For the mind of Man is a thing of many parts, interacting,
fighting and cooperating by turn in various combinations. It never
rests from change. The 'I' has no constant nature, but only the
nature it takes on from those parts of the being that are dominant
at a given moment. For all practical purposes, it <i>is</i> those
parts and their interaction, and nothing more. The seeming continuity
of its existence comes not from itself, but from the River of
Memory, carrying the sensations of past moments in itself, taking
them downwards in the being to be deposited like silt in the delta
at the edge of the Dark Sea.
<p>
&quot;Now 'I' [said humorously] could
continue this metaphor into many other areas. But needs not; we
have seen sufficient of it for the moment. But consider, as a
final example of the metaphor, the political customs of ancient
Egypt. Therein the seeming balance and centrality of the Pharaohs
(representatives of the Sun of &quot;Self&quot;) was never more
than a superficial image hiding the perpetual infighting of the
priests of different cities and gods. Each constantly striving
to make themselves dominant, each taking in turn the central position
and losing it again. And consider that the Sun-self of Egypt itself
shattered eventually into a myriad of divisions, and died, and
was carried by the Nile to vanish in the Dark Sea.
<p>
I asked the unseen speaker whether he
might show something of the ministers of this part of the Earth,
and of its nature in other aspects of being. It said &quot;Not
at this time.&quot; I asked if there was anything else to be seen
at the moment, and receive only silence as an answer. So I spoke
my thanks and departed the vision.
<p>

<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
The content of this vision is fairly
clear, and doesn't need a great deal of comment. Since we are
working here with a &quot;downward&quot; current, it begins with
a fall from unity into disunity, chaos, and discord. Appropriately,
Occodon is ruled by the zodiacal king of Gemini, the most dualistic
of the signs. The characteristics presented are typical of Gemini,
but raised to an archetypal level.
<p>
Egypt, the mundane region governed by
Occodon, is used as a metaphor for the Earth, the human being,
and human society, as they are affected by the power in the Call
of the Aethyrs. The four-sided pyramids might represent the seemingly-ordered
worlds of human experience, resting on a foundation of chaos --
the ever-shifting particles of the desert sands. <br>

Pascomb, Part 2 of 91, 2nd of LIL. Zodiacal
King: Zinggen. Ministers: 2360. Mundane association: Syria
<p>
7/15/1994 2:40 p.m.
<p>
I invoked <a NAME="Pascomb">PASCOMB</a> by the power of Zinggen and the Aethyr LIL, calling upon the
2360 ministers who dwell there to come and present its nature.
<p>
At first there was only a sense of a
very strange energy. A sort of quintessence of  sundering, without
any object. As if an act of ripping something apart had been separated
from the things being ripped and made into a spiritual ideal.

<p>
A voice said:
<p>
&quot;A mighty tearing suffuses the
universe, rending each thing from its opposite. That which is
above and that which is below are sundered from one another; that
which is to the right is sundered from that which is to the left;
that which is before is sundered from that which is behind. 
<p>
&quot;And all things are brought to
one level; each thing above is brought down, each thing below
is raised up; that which is before and behind, to the left and
to the right, are brought to the center and inextricably mixed.
<p>
&quot;And out of that mixture are new
dualities formed. None higher or lower than the others; there
is no ranking here. Observe:&quot;
<p>
There came before me the image of the
sign of Gemini seen in the last vision, with its straight side
pillars and the curved top and bottom bars. It underwent a transformation:
the portions of the bars between the two pillars broke away from
the parts outside; those outer parts blended into the pillars.
Gradually the two center parts of the bars moved towards the center
of the figure; as they did so, the parts of the pillars they passed
ceased to be straight and became smoothly curved towards the outside.
The bars met and merged together into one longer bar, and the
sign of Gemini was transformed into the sign of Pisces.
<p>
&quot;Thus it is with these parts of
the Aethyrs, which God has made into parts of the Earth. For she
is not a place of hierarchies, but a [spherical] surface; and
upon that surface are the powers arrayed in their might. That
which is shown as various spheres in Dee's diagram is not truly
so. The parts are dispersed about her surface like the colors
about the surface of a soap bubble; and like those colors, they
are constantly shifting, changing their places. At one moment
one might cover a great territory, only to be practically overthrown
in the next by its neighbors.&quot;
<p>
(As the above was said, it was impressed
on me in an instant that all the variations of the Earth's surface
were minute and indistinguishable with respect to the world's
size. The highest mountains and deepest ocean trenches vary less
than one part in sixteen hundred of the world's diameter. In relation
to its size, the variations in the Earth's surface are no more
significant than the variations in thickness that cause the color
shifts of the soap bubble. Why this should be emphasized, I don't
know; perhaps I missed something.)
<p>
Now I saw an image of the world with
the Aethyrs arrayed about it in concentric spheres. Again there
came the sundering force that opened the vision, and all these
spheres were broken into pieces. The pieces tumbled down towards
the Earth, and as they hit the surface they slid over and around
each other until none of them was above any other. Gradually they
expanded and shifted until they covered the entire surface. 
<p>
Each of these pieces seemed to be both
a sort of energy and a living liquid at the same time. I could
distinguish them by their differing shades and hues, each unique.
Now they seemed to be at war with each other; the effect was of
a bunch of brightly colored slime molds fighting for territory.
Each pushed against its neighbors, seeking to gain more ground
for itself. One might lose ground for a time, but was never completely
extinguished; if all its territory in one place was taken by its
neighbors, it simply sprang up again in another place where the
pressure was low. 
<p>
And it seemed to me that each of these
living &quot;parts&quot; was in fact the cause of some idea that
lives in the minds of men, or rather of those shared perceptions
and ideals that make up the identity of a nation or a group. Because
each part is unique in its essence, it follows that all groups
must be in conflict with each other at one time or another. Harmony
is the result of likeness or complementarity of nature; where
likeness does not exist, there must be friction and conflict.
Thus the idea of complete unity among nations is doomed to fail,
as is the unity or harmony between groups within nations. If a
certain type of belief or government is overthrown in a certain
part of the Earth's population, it will simply appear again in
another part, or as a minority belief within a particular culture.

<p>
The voice said: &quot;Thou hast grasped
it. Thus it was said to Dee that these parts governed the governments
of the Earth, and that one could manipulate those governments
through the use of the power of the corresponding part. It extends
through all levels of organization within the world; since all
individuals are unique, they must at sometimes be in conflict
with their neighbors. And thus it was said in the Thelemic book
that Horus, god of War, is the ruler of this world.
<p>
&quot;We would emphasize again that
the parts of the Earth, and the Aethyrs from which they spring,
are <i>not</i> expressions of the unity of existence, but of the
aspect of discord. In this they are the complement, the necessary
balance to the divine and angelic Names derived from the Great
Table by orderly means. Those names and hierarchies show the unity
aspect, the merging of the discord of events into the singleness
of spirit. Here we deal with the shattering of that unity, with
its expression in the unspeakable variety of unique events taking
place in the world at any moment. 
<p>
&quot;Now, in order to continue, we
would have you wait for an hour or so, and relax. For there is
more to see, but the time is not quite right. Return again today.
<p>
7/16/1994 8:04 p.m.
<p>
(I did not return to the vision until
now because the timing felt wrong.)
<p>
I again recited the Call for LIL and
invoked PASCOMB. After a few minutes the force of the Part came
strongly. The Voice continued.
<p>
&quot;Now, you have grasped the connection
between the power of these Parts and the actions of government.
Truly, the world is in a constant state of war, from the standpoint
of the Aethyrs. And the most active, violent of those wars at
present take place not upon the physical plane, but upon the planes
of emotion and reason, For each Idea has power within these worlds,
and any Idea which is supported at its core by the creative power
of God (as most are) cannot be eradicated wholly from the world.

<p>
&quot;Even should it be wholly washed
away from the minds of all living beings, it would arise again
spontaneously. For it requires not the power of men to maintain
its existence; its has an energy separate from their recognition
and support. Should it be washed away, then at some future moment,
some man or woman would (through natural affinity) touch its power
with their mind, and it would instantly become real within the
world again.
<p>
&quot;This war is perpetual, and the
only thing that changes its character are the slow changes in
the consciousness of God, as its creative plan evolves over time.
At any given point in time, some ideas are emphasized by these
changes and others de-emphasized. Thus in the previous age did
social ideas take an extreme hierarchical form with those on the
bottom serving those on top, while in this present age are social
ideas more oriented towards the masses of men and their needs.
<p>
&quot;But the dominance of one sort
of ideal does not eliminate the others; they remain always, and
insinuate themselves into the functioning of society and of life
in the details of activity where they cannot gain dominance in
the overall rulership. And if that dominance of an ideal should
fail, then others -- temporarily suppressed -- regain their prior
place. Thus the rapidity with which the Soviet Union devolved
into its cultural predecessors; the local cultures had not been
absorbed by the ideal, but only overlaid, partially smothered
by it.
<p>
&quot;And the war is reflected even
in the functioning of the living things of the world. For each
type of animal and each type of plant is at war with those upon
which it feeds, even as it is dependent upon them. And each unique
being fights against its neighbors for its share of the available
resources. Trees wage slow, years-long battles against each other;
lesser plants feed upon the detritus of that war, and wage their
smaller wars beneath. And so on.
<p>
&quot;Never shall this conflict be done,
no, not even should the Kingdom of Heaven come. For it is the
nature of the third of the three Great Aspects of God's creation
(of which the body, emotions, and mind are a part) that every
particle and composite being within the world shall respond <i>uniquely</i>
to the power of God's creative will. Where the proper goal of
each is unique [i.e., it's &quot;true will&quot; under the power
of the divine] then conflict inevitably arises.
<p>
(On an unspoken level, it was also mentioned
that unity lies only in the Second and First divine aspects, those
of Love and Will (or Being), both of which are entirely spiritual
in nature, and come into the manifest world only through the action
of initiated sapients.)
<p>
&quot;There is no unity within the manifest
world, nor shall there ever be. Those who seek to impose such
a unity, through law or morals or &quot;correct behavior&quot;
are doomed to failure. God wishes it so; were the manifest world
one in all ways then it would no longer be a fit material for
His creative activity, and for the creations of those lesser beings
who dwell within it. Creation is change, and change always brings
conflict. 
<p>
&quot;Now we have said enough and would
end here, if you will.&quot;
<p>
I said I had no questions that had not
already been answered in the nonverbal subtext of the presentation.
I thanked those who spoke, and ended the vision.<br>

Valgars, Part 3 of 91, 3rd of LIL. Zodiacal
King: Alpudus. Ministers: 5362. Mundane association: Mesopotamia.
<p>
7/19/1994 1:10 p.m.
<p>
<a NAME="Valgars">Recited the Call for
LIL and invoked VALGARS by the power of the zodiacal king Alpudus.
</a>
<p>
The vision opened with an image of the
glyph of Pisces as in the previous vision. The glyph was colored
a deep ocean blue. Immediately the crossbar of the glyph broke
in two places, close to the curves. The remaining part of the
bar contracted to a dot between the two curves, the parts of the
bar still connected to the curves were absorbed into them.
<p>
The two curves rotated about their centers
so that their lower ends came together. For a moment a half-moon
seemed to grow off of the top of the right-hand curve, so that
the whole figure seemed like an Enochian letter &quot;B&quot;. The dot between the
curves became a diamond. But the half-moon quickly disappeared
and the figure turned blood-red, becoming the glyph of Aries.

<p>
The glyph tilted away from me and moved
away at the same time. From below an image of the Earth came into
view, and the glyph descended, coming to rest with its two arms
conjunct with the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. The dot between
the arms marked the location of Baghdad -- actually slightly north
and west of there; perhaps ancient Babylon. The point where the
arms met did not quite touch the Persian Gulf; it ended in the
marshes where the two rivers meet.
<p>
The view descended towards the Earth,
and I saw that it was indeed Babylon that was depicted. The region
surrounding the city was green with growing crops and grassland;
not the dry waste of current-day Iraq. Across the river to the
west I could see forested hills.
<p>
The city was enclosed in a long wall,
save for a short stretch of the river bank near the center of
one wall. This gap did not seem to be deliberate, but rather the
result of erosion undermining the wall. Within there seemed to
be a smaller area with high walls as well; perhaps the area of
the palace and main temples. 
<p>
Now the viewpoint rotated around the
city to the eastern gate. A long thoroughfare extended west to
an unfinished ziggurat. I saw people moving down the avenue towards
me; they passed through the gate and dispersed to the four directions.
<p>
The Voice spoke:
<p>
&quot;The tower you see is of course
the so-called Tower of Babel. And the people are dispersing as
was said in the biblical myth. But it was not the hand of God
which produced this effect, except indirectly, through the power
of the Part governing this region. The symbolism of the Tower
is of course the symbolism of Mars, ruler of Aries. And it is
the characteristics of the sign and its ruler that are here represented
in one aspect. 
<p>
&quot;You know of course that Aries
represents the initial outpouring of force that begins any project,
any work of creativity. It is the force that overcomes the inertia
of matter and moves it into a different state. But this force
is short of duration; it gives out quickly, burns itself up. If
the work of creation were to continue, it would need to be imbued
with the longer-lasting force of Habit or Custom, which maintain
the new state. But that is to be seen elsewhere, not here.
<p>
&quot;What is shown here is the illusory
unity provided by the imposition of force upon disparate, chaotic
elements each having their own unique nature. Such unity never
lasts; as soon as the force is exhausted, or directed towards
a different goal, then it dissolves into its initial elements
again. This is as we said in the previous Part, here manifested
in its actuality.
<p>
&quot;The various cities of the lands
between the two rivers at times tried to impose their rule on
their surroundings by force. Their rulers sensed in their minds
the nature of the power of this Part, and attempted to manifest
it. But such rulership was not natural to the area, was imposed
upon a pre-existing &quot;culture&quot; in which smaller specialized
settlements coexisted in a complex network of trade. 
<p>
&quot;In this earlier culture, the specializations
of each town depended upon the resources available in their area.
One being close to clay deposits would engage in the manufacture
of pots and bowls. Another having flint would make cutting and
digging tools. Yet another might have timber, or medicinal plants,
fertile grain-growing lands, or grasslands for cattle. Each of
these would make the most of its local resources and trade along
the network for the other items they needed. 
<p>
&quot;This is not unlike the current-day
state of the world economy, though in miniature. And the failure
of the imposed rulerships of the great cities gives a lesson that
might be learned today. 
<p>
&quot;The early centralized rulerships
were initially accepted for the same reason that every government
since has been accepted. It seemed advantageous to the people
of the towns to give over a portion of their production in exchange
for protection from the larger losses to criminals and raiders
along the trade routes. But once the principle of centralized
rule was accepted, things rapidly went downhill. 
<p>
&quot;The rulers must draw more and
more on the productivity of the towns in order to widen their
rule. The wider the borders of the kingdom, the larger the portion
of production that must be spent on defense and internal regulation.
This is simple geometry. Eventually the point of diminishing returns
is passed; the rulers can no longer take enough resources out
of the economy to maintain their rule. The hardship for those
from whom it is taken increases until they are no longer willing
to support the &quot;national&quot; government, and the system
collapses. 
<p>
&quot;In the Babel incident, it is this
failure of resources that is the true cause of the disruption.
The craftsmen who were building the tower were drawn from many
peoples in the area, each of them with their own customs and variation
on the regional speech. When the rulers could no longer pay for
their services, they perceived this as a sign of divine disfavor;
their confidence in the communal project was lost, ethnic tensions
increased, and finally they left to return to their home towns.
<p>
&quot;This is the failure of every government
that seeks to rule by force, from ancient Uruk and Ur to the present
day. In those earlier cases, the process was sometimes advanced
by deterioration of the climate, or -- more commonly -- by the
failure of crops upon which the city-dwellers were dependent.

<p>
&quot;The region of the Earth governed
by Valgars shows this tendency with particular emphasis. One after
another came conquering rulers; many of them inspired by the imaginary
&quot;glory&quot; of the memory of their predecessors. The early
cities, the Babylonians, Assyrians, the Baghdad of ancient times
and the present, all have sought to rule and each has fallen back
into chaos when their power was no longer sufficient to the task.
Over and over the same story is replayed. Even now, the ruler
of Iraq perceives himself as the incarnation of an ancient Assyrian
ruler, dazzled by the vision of restoring ancient glories even
as his nation is rent asunder around him. 
<p>
&quot;Like the flow of the two great
rivers, the power of this Part seems mighty in its beginning and
continuation, but in the end it collapses into chaos; as the two
rivers become lost in the great marshes of their combined delta.
When their waters finally reach the sea, they get there through
a myriad of tortuous channels, not in the great unified flow that
their beginnings promised. And so it ends, always.
<p>
&quot;Now we would like for you to continue
with these visions; it seems to us that you would be doing a service
thereby. But be not concerned if there be interruptions, hiatuses
in the work. For this is necessarily a long-term project, and
it is certain that other tasks and opportunities will come between
at times. Do what thou will, when thou will, and we will be accessible
to you. We are done, for today.&quot;
<p>
I thanked the Voice for its presentation,
and ended the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
This completes the Parts attributed
to LIL. It is too early to speculate on the complete course to
be presented, but some obvious connections can be made between
these three parts.
<p>
First, all three deal in some way with
the chaos or disorder that precedes the initiation of a creative
act -- and which may well be stimulated by the first inflow of
creative force. There is an increasing constraint upon the unorganized
materia as the visions progress: Occodon defines outer boundaries,
Pascomb organizes the content of those boundaries into conflicting
elements, Valgars shows the first attempts to bring the materia
into conformance with a creative will. 
<p>
Second, each vision deals with a region
that is (loosely speaking) bounded by water on two sides. Egypt
by Lake Victoria and the Mediterranean Sea, Syria (mundane equivalent
of Pascomb) by the Euphrates and Jordan, and Mesopotamia by the
Euphrates and Tigris. The repetitive occurrence of opposed curves
in the astrological glyphs is probably connected with this.
<p>
I get the sense that the &quot;failure
of government&quot; theme of the three visions is a reflection
of the fall from unity embodied in the Call of the Aethyrs. Were
we taking the Parts in the reverse sequence, (as Crowley did with
the Aethyrs themselves) it may be that these parts would show
the final return to unity in the divine.
<p>
The presence of Babylon in the third
vision is odd, since Babylon has its own Part later on in the
series (number 80, Mathula). The region named Mesopotamia in Liber
Scientia is called Upper Mesopotamia today. I suspect that whatever
beings were the Voice of this vision were simply using it as a
convenient substitute for the city of  Sargon the Great, who created
the first empire with a true centralized government in upper Mesopotamia
circa 2500 BC, and whose empire ended 160 years later in much
the way described. The latter name was apparently buried too deep
in the silt of my unconscious mind to be dredged up on short notice;
it popped into awareness about fifteen minutes after the vision
ended.<br>

<a NAME="Doagnis">Dongnis or Doagnis,
part of ARN. Zodiacal King: Zarnaah   Servitors: 3636  Equivalent
to Cappadocia in Liber Scientia.</a>
<p>
August 24, 1994 circa 2:00 p.m.
<p>
Everything is dark, dark. And in the
center is a deeper darkness, that feels like a circular sinkhole
in the fabric of the space, a cylinder of emptiness in the midst
of things.
<p>
Now it seems as if this cylinder is
becoming lit from some source inside it. Lines of light trace
a rectilinear grid over its inner surface, and it becomes filled
with a light like daylight. It begins to rotate on its long axis.
Simultaneously, my viewpoint rotates about it in a horizontal
plane so that I am seeing its length from an outside point perpendicular
to the axis and equidistant from its ends. Its rotation is such
that the upper side is rolling away from my viewpoint.
<p>
I can still see the grid inside it,
vaguely through its surface. The grid becomes clearer, and begins
to shine from the outside as well. The shining potions become
raised in relief against the surface, and the whole takes on a
sense of solidity.
<p>
Suddenly the cylinder begins to move
away from me rapidly. It leaves behind an imprint of its shining
lines, like the cylindrical seals used by ancients governors.
It seems to be creating the surface it is imprinting as it rolls
along. The cylinder recedes into the distance and vanishes.
<p>
The long, paper-thin surface it left
behind now begins to curl upwards at the sides. The long sides
come together, but in such a way that the grid-lines at right
angles to its length are offset by one line at their meeting point.
The new cylinder thus formed has straight lines along its length;
the cross-lines, which were rectilinear in the original cylinder,
now form several helices around it, due to the offset. Those parts
of the &quot;surface&quot; that were not imprinted now dissolve,
leaving a cylindrical net of glowing lines.
<p>
This process propagates itself along
the length of the surface until any still-unconnected parts are
lost in the distance. Nothing else happens for a few minutes.

<p>
While all this was happening, I got
a vague impression that the helical net is a representation of
the universe -- no, specifically of the solar system. Each of
the helices represents a planet's course through space, while
the straight lines represent the course of the system as a whole.
And by correspondence, it also represents the psyche and experience
of man, wherein events are cyclic but progress forward in time.

<p>
Now a voice said, &quot;How else shall
chaos be taméd? How else shall the disorder of creations'
energies be brought into order? How else shall balance be attained?
Is it not said, 'Her course let it run with the heavens, and as
a handmaid let her serve them'? 
<p>
&quot;Change cannot be stopped or frozen;
that way lies the grave, and the end of things. Yet it can be
diverted, and set to run along a limited set of paths; paths which
lead, in the end, to the achievement of the creator's purpose.

<p>
&quot;Here in this region, the powers
previously shown, the powers of creative energy unleashed within
the Earth, are for the first time brought into ordering, so that
the dynamic changes that take place in the world, by the will
of god, shall all be (in the long run) of benefit to his purpose.

<p>
&quot;Yet is this ordering hidden from
the minds of men, and the lesser beings who inhabit the earth;
they see only the surface of remaining disorder, the clashing
of powers as they compete for influence over events. Thus is it
said 'Confound the understanding of her with darkness'. 
<p>
&quot;Now let us move away from this
for a time, for this is a profound mystery, and not to be revealed
in its entirety. By other means might we know more of the action
here. Let the 3636 ministers who dwell herein make themselves
known.&quot;
<p>
A multitude of beings appeared. Most
of them were dressed in judicial robes, some with the white wigs
of English tradition. All carried implements in their hands; some
a gavel, others a scale, others yet a book of laws. And among
them was one who carried about him the image of the Six of Pentacles
in the Rider deck; this one projected this image so strongly that
the rest were hidden.
<p>
The voice said, &quot;This card is called
'Material Success', and yet the image shows not a man among his
wealth, as would be the case for that meaning, but a man standing
with his head above the other people, carrying a set of balances
raised in the air above their line of sight, while with his other
hand he distributes gold to the lowly, some to one, more to another,
none to others. 
<p>
&quot;Thus it symbolizes the function
of this region; events conform to a balance on a high level, yet
that which comes into the manifest world (represented by the kneeling
figures) is of a seemingly random and capricious nature. And he
who acts within those higher levels knows of the balance, yet
cannot act within the world in a purely balanced manner. Thus
he seems unfair, even cruel, to those who know not the God of
Justice and his works and purpose. They unconsciously recognize
his inner wealth, and view him with fear, and envy, and resentment,
and with the urge to spoil. Thus does his balance evoke imbalance.
<p>
&quot;So also with the ministers of
Doagnis; they are concerned not with the justice of their acts
as seen by the uninitiated, or by the lesser creatures of Earth.
They act only to set god's limitations upon the chaos of his creative
energies, to channel the Timeless according to the dictates of
Time. For the outcome of those limitations in the worlds of men,
they care not at all. For the world is an illusion to them, a
place of horrors and joys quickly passed, ephemeral and unreal.
Tis all a stage to them, and the men and women only players; they
know that when the players remove their masks and exit the stage,
then is the play seen for what it was, and the great trials of
life are dismissed as a momentary dream.
<p>
&quot;Now, you could penetrate further
into this place, but it seems not necessary at this time. Come
again when you will, or go on to another region. Fare you well.&quot;
<p>
The sense of the voice's presence faded.
The image of the Six of Pentacles remained for a time, then it
too faded. I left the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
According to the system I was directed
to use for these visions, the Zodiacal King ruling Doagnis is
attributed to Libra. The overall sense of the vision, however,
was more Saturnian. The hole, cylinder, and rectilinear designs
of the early part are all related to that planet, as are the general
themes of  Time and imposed order.
<p>
Even when Libra does appear, in the
ideas of balance and justice, it is a lesser or degenerate form
of the sign's ideal. Justice is not seen as a balancing of injury
and compensation, or of mediation between conflicting goals, but
simply as selective restriction on the individual expressions
possible in nature. The consequence of such a view is often extreme
<i>in</i>justice. 
<p>
The three regions of LIL shown in previous
visions all had something to do with the theme of &quot;failure
of government&quot;, consequent upon the fall from the unity of
pure divinity. Perhaps it is not so surprising that this first
region of ARN should go to the opposite extreme, seeking to impose
an artificial unity (as represented by the rectilinear grid) as
a substitute for the real thing. 
<p>
The justice and order shown here is
the false justice of the religious or political fanatic, the person
who fears the unspeakable variety of existence, and therefor seeks
to restrict it to &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;correct&quot; manifestations.
It is the order of the person who mistakes his own internally
generated image of god for god itself, who mistakes his own limited
perceptions for those of god, and seeks to impose them on all
others. 
<p>
Compare the justifications following
the appearance of the Six of Pentacles with those of any idealist,
revolutionary or religious politician. Like those people, the
beings here justify their cruelties in the real world by claiming
to follow a &quot;higher purpose&quot;, saying that the miseries
they force on their fellow beings are necessary to promote the
higher good. Like the Voice of this vision, they even lay the
blame for it on those they oppress, saying &quot;It's all their
fault if they can't see the Great Purpose.&quot;<br>

Thursday, August 25, 1994 3:05 PM
<p>
As soon as I thought about doing this
vision, my head was filled with light, of an odd quality. The
old sci-fi hack's term &quot;sleeting radiation&quot; seemed perfectly
appropriate. It felt like my head was being irradiated by some
point-source that just happened to be coincide with its center,
but was in no way directly connected with it. The radiation gave
the impression of packets of energy that zapped outwards from
the source, each leaving behind a streak of energized paths in
the neurons of the brain. Each streak produced a sense of bubbling
energy in the brain.
<p>
I vibrated the Call and appropriate
names, and recorded the above paragraph.
<p>
After vibrating the names for several
minutes more, a space started to appear. Rather than appearing
and then remaining steady, it would become visible for a moment,
then it would disappear again, then reappear. Rather like watching
a movie with a pause between frames. The space did not seem to
exist when not visible; there was no sense that events there had
advanced any in the time between appearances.
<p>
Finally the appearance steadied. But
the situation was not entirely improved thereby; now it seemed
as if the space had two aspects, which I was viewing simultaneously.

<p>
In one of these views, I saw many people
dressed in violet-colored robes with trim in the complementary
yellow. Each carried some sort of box held before him. The boxes
were decorated with ribbons of many colors, which drifted and
waved about as they moved. I got the sense that the boxes held
holy relics of some sort, or were themselves relics. Each of these
people moved on a unique path through space, never touching or
colliding with others.
<p>
As they moved, one or another of them
would sing a note. And as that note reached the ears of certain
others, they would in turn sing -- usually a different note, but
one in the same key. Only a few responded to any particular note,
but all of them were responding to some note within any short
period of time. The overall effect was of a light rain in which
the landing of every drop produced a different tone. 
<p>
It also seemed that every time one of
them sounded a note, the ribbons on the boxes they held extended
a bit further out into the surrounding space, each ribbon still
waving in invisible currents. Eventually the entire space was
filled with crisscrossing ribbons, practically obscuring their
origins.
<p>
The other view was less striking. Balls
of light moved on slow orbital paths through the space. Occasionally
one would throw out a smaller bit of light, which would move along
until it hit another large ball. The receiving ball would momentarily
brighten and expand its diameter; after an irregular period of
time it would in turn throw out a smaller ball of light, at the
same time dimming and becoming smaller.
<p>
Turning back to the first view, I examined
the boxes more closely. Each was made of square panels with smooth
square borders covering about one-sixth of their width. The center
of each panel, each side, was filled with intricate carvings in
every imaginable style and subject-matter. The carvings moved
as I watched, so that the pictures unfolded their stories. The
movements went in jerks -- a change, then a short wait, another
change, and so on. 
<p>
E.g., in one showing a mass of ivy,
the vines would slowly move and sprout new leaves, live a time-lapse
image of plant growth. In another a macabre scene showed a woman
being slowly burned at the stake while peasants and a demon in
priests robes watched, danced, and talked among themselves. In
another a composer slowly set notes of a score onto paper. I had
the impression that if I looked long enough I could find the whole
world's history and human activity represented in the sides of
these many boxes. 
<p>
But at the same time I sensed that these
scenes were superficial. They did not in any way reflect the contents
of the boxes; they were all &quot;outside&quot; and no &quot;inside&quot;.

<p>
Examining the interior of one box I
found -- more boxes. Each was like the one that contained it,
in that it had ribbons waving about it and panels with pictures.
It seemed that each of the major boxes contained its own universe
of smaller boxes, and possibly each of these in turn contained
its own internal universe. And if I suppressed knowledge of the
enclosing level of boxes for a moment, it seemed that these smaller
boxes connected not only with those in their own &quot;universe&quot;
but as well with those in every other.
<p>
I began to weary of looking at this
Chinese-puzzle world, and thought it was time for the Voice to
come and make some explanation of things. After a few moments,
it did so.
<p>
&quot;You have already recognized the
essence of this vision, and I will leave it to you to explain
in your notes. Let us touch upon some other concerns at this time.
<p>
&quot;The boxes are, as you guessed,
entities of some sort or another; not always, or even usually,
human, but organizations of matter into complex forms. Any of
the kingdoms of nature might be represented, or any of many other
unrecognized systems. 
<p>
&quot;Each such entity carries with
it not only the behavior it presents to the world (in the form
of the pictures) but also its own complete history of existence,
and [emphasized] the history of every component that went into
its making, back to the very beginnings of things. And each of
these components continues to interact with the rest of the universe
in its own terms, even as it acts as a part of the larger whole.
This is the true living order of existence, as opposed to the
sterile, dead order of the previous vision. Explain the rest as
you will; it is no great difficulty for you.
<p>
&quot;Now, what I intended to remark
upon was the manner in which you might progress further in your
understanding of the Enochian universe and its god. This is a
matter not entirely related to these visions of the Parts, and
so should not be done by me. Bide a moment and another will come
and tell you.&quot;
<p>
I waited. After several minutes there
were brief shadowy images of a figure standing before me. Nothing
more happened, so I got up and went to the bathroom, then sat
on my bed and meditated for a while. 
<p>
There was a feeling that I needed to
be in a different space in order to understand what was coming.
Reaching out to sense that space, I tried to discard the power
of the Part and adopt the new one.
<p>
Shortly I had a brief sight of the Comselha
circle, as seen from high above. As described elsewhere, I noted
a toroidal field of force around it, with a beam projecting upwards
from the hollow center. I felt myself drawn into this beam. Gradually
it drew me upwards until I was within sight of the interstellar
nexus being built on the edge of the Earth's aura.
<p>
I noted that it's construction seemed
to be coming along well. Only a couple of unincorporated sections
remained at a distance from the main structure, and that structure
was solidly anchored by heavy beams directed at nearby stars and
the Earth. 
<p>
The core levels appeared to be completely
finished; I could see no gaps in the sphere. A larger surrounding
sphere was almost complete; I sensed that several individual lines
of force still needed to be anchored. 
<p>
Moving into the center of the sphere,
I saw a glyph high up on one wall. I could not see it clearly,
but it appeared to be a cross between the Hindu OM and the glyph
of Capricorn. Perhaps this was a designator for stars or constellations
in that direction? Other glyphs also appeared, but even more difficult
to see, as if as yet their force had not be completely set in
place here.
<p>
Sunday, August 28, 1994 1:03 PM
<p>
For some reason, I wasn't very happy
with the vision of Pacasna, and decided to do it again, just to
see if anything else could be seen. 
<p>
Vibrated the Call twice, vibrating the
name of the Aethyr a few times in between. Called upon Ziracah
to direct the ministers dwelling in Pacasna to come to my aid
and demonstrate the power of their part of the Earth.
<p>
Almost immediately I got the same sense
of &quot;bubbling energy&quot; the opened the previous vision.
No images appeared, but I started getting intuitions about the
Parts. 
<p>
It occurred to me that these first two
parts of ARN represent, in an odd way, the &quot;mother&quot;
and &quot;father&quot; aspects of existence. Doagnis placed a
heavy emphasis on Time and Regulated Motion as the sources of
Order. Pacasna places the emphasis on Energy and Innate Relationship
as a sort of non-imposed order, with an added fillip of Unpredictability.
So their essential natures are contrary.
<p>
It also occurred to me that Doagnis
places more emphasis on the influence of the &quot;higher&quot;
worlds, represented by the astrological forces, where events are
collected into a sort of synthesis by their relationship to those
forces. Whereas Pacasna places emphasis on the seemingly chaotic
manifestation of events within the &quot;lower&quot; worlds, where
the unique natures of things have their expression -- as represented
by the highly varied pictures that appeared on the sides of the
boxes. (Note that the boxes are all &quot;outside&quot; and no
&quot;inside&quot;, as might be said of manifestations in Malkuth
as the world of shells. Thus the duality of the two parts is shown
again, and the theme of Division common to the Parts in LIL is
continued as an unspoken background.
<p>
One might also contrast the two as representing
respectively the relativistic and the quantum mechanical views
of reality. The events in Doagnis occurred in smooth, continuous
changes of state; events in Pacasna occurred in discrete &quot;jumps&quot;.
<p>
And again, in Doagnis there is a definite
hierarchy of above and below. In Pacasna hierarchy is a matter
of arbitrary viewpoint; events on all levels are essentially similar,
and take place at the same time, with no way to tell which level
of events is causative or most significant. 
<p>
I also get the impression that the three
Parts in ARN are in mirror sequence to those of LIL. Where in
LIL the order goes 1-2-3, in ARN it goes 6-5-4. Thus I am doing
the Parts in backwards order, as far as their interrelationship
goes. It may be that this is the reason for my sense of dissatisfaction
with the visions; I am seeing the end before the beginning.
<p>
Having received these intuitions, the
energy of the Part lapsed, and I stopped attempting to receive
more.<br>

<p>
Monday, August 29, 1994 2:10 p.m.
<p>
Vibrated the Call and the appropriate
names.
<p>
I first saw the sigil of the Part drawn
within a circle on the ground. The name of the Part was written
in both Enochian and English letters in a border around the circumference,
so that the whole had the appearance of a simple talisman.
<p>
Next a woman appeared within the circle.
She had blonde hair and her face was hidden behind it. She was
crouched down on her right knee, her right hand on the ground.
Her left arm was raised and bent back as if she was trying to
remove something from the back of her neck. She wore a she wore
a white summer dress of some light fabric.
<p>
Her posture reminded me of the Crowley's
Tarot card &quot;The Star&quot;. But even more, it recalled one
of Rodin's more striking sculptures, called (I believe) &quot;The
Helmet-maker's Beautiful Wife&quot;. The sculpture shows a crone
in a similar posture, and carries a tremendous freight of sorrow
for lost things. The figure in the circle sends forth a sense
of great sorrow, and of being one on whom an unbearable load has
been placed. (I am reminded as well of another sculpture, I think
also by Rodin, called &quot;Caryatid Fallen Under Her Stone&quot;.)
<p>
Now the figure before me cries: &quot;Woe!
Woe! And again Woe! I am beset by those above me and those below.
The ones above me seek to bind me to them in unity; those below
seek to disperse me into chaos. Yet in myself I am neither one
nor many, and their pressure wearies my soul to death. How shall
I escape these evils?&quot;
<p>
An angel comes forward from the upper
right of my field of view, dressed in violet robes. It pulls the
figure out of the circle, and takes its place in the same posture.
After a few moments it hardens into stone, or forms a shell of
stone in its own shape, to take the load. The angel then leaves
this stone figure like a ghost leaving the body, and stands beside
the circle with the original occupant, who is now clearly a young
woman of an airy nature.
<p>
The angel makes a sign like alchemical
sulfur towards me, apparently expecting it to be returned; I do
so. Then another sign like the &quot;V&quot; of LVX, but the impression
is of a descending triangle over a cross. Again I return it.
<p>
The angel turns to the woman, and performs
a series of gestures I don't recognize. But I know as they are
done that they spell LILITH, followed by a gesture of releasing.
<p>
As the gestures are completed, the woman
goes through an astonishing number of transformations in an instant,
becoming many different women in turn. Without, seemingly, changing
her essential nature. Finally she turns into a woman of some non-Semitic
Middle Eastern race; long wavy black hair, dark eyes, olive skin,
in the skirt-and-girdle outfit seen in some pictures of ancient
priestesses. Snakes appear, curled around her wrists. Then she
vanishes, absorbed into the fabric of space itself.
<p>
&quot;Know&quot; the angel said, &quot;that
all acts of creation act upon a pre-existing substance.&quot;
Answering a question in my mind he said, &quot;There was no first
act of creation; all has ever been in process. And this substance
precedes even that process. None of any level of reality know
its origins or destiny.
<p>
&quot;This substance, protean, ever-changing,
livingness itself, is that out of which all creations come. Binah
is its reflection in our world, though it surpasses Binah in all
ways, and surpasses the Wheel and the Point as well. And here
it is reflected again in the substance of the Aethyrs, as it must
be in any of its children.
<p>
&quot;You will see her anon in other
Parts, as she takes on other roles with respect to this creation.
But in this place, as you have sensed, she is acted upon by the
force of the other two parts within ARN, as the substance upon
which each seeks to impose its form of order within the world.
And so she was first seen as placed under a burden, as the pressure
of one and the other sought to mold her into their preferred form.
<p>
&quot;But in her essence she is above
both, contains both, and cannot be so limited. And the action
of those Parts causes to be formed instead an image, an illusory
construct (of a lesser order of existence) which fulfills their
intent. 
<p>
&quot;Now the previous two Parts represent,
each in their way, the primary themes of the substance aspect
of existence within this world. [The word &quot;substance&quot;
was emphasized.] On the one hand, smooth motion, cyclic appearances,
direct causation and spiral progressions; on the other hand, sudden
jumps, indeterminacy, acausal relationship, and dynamic, mutually
affective interactions.
<p>
&quot;The lesser cannot contain the
greater, and so their action is futile in the extreme; certainly
no great part of the divine substance shall be formed to their
will. They cannot even contact it in its essence, for their level
is not high enough. But part of its manifestation [emphasized],
the product of previous cycles of creation, is amenable to their
intent, and visible to their eyes. And this portion they take
for the whole, and press upon. 
<p>
&quot;And in the process they summon,
for a time, by its intrinsic connection with Her, something of
the true substance. This gives new life to the old manifestation,
allowing it to mutate and change in accordance with their will,
taking on the desired characteristics without losing anything
of its past history. It groans like a living thing under the burden
of their will, until it is changed and the changes established
as a permanent nature. 
<p>
&quot;The task being complete, the summoned
portion of the divine woman's power is released, and the manifest
substance goes more or less its own way, in response to the subsequent
promptings of the creators involved. The direct activity of the
higher substance lapses, and whatever portion of its livingness
was involved returns into itself.
<p>
&quot;It is in this releasing process
that we ministers of Dialioa have our work. Our task is to ensure
that the higher substance does not remain, for to do so would
be to give greater weight to the actions upon its manifestation
than is desirable. There would be a continuing impression of the
will upon the substance aspect.
<p>
&quot;This is a subtle thing, but must
be understood. The substance forms the base of a creation, and
has certain characteristics inherent as a part of that creation.
But the purpose of the creative act, the goal of the creator's
impulse, grows out of the substance along another, different dimension.
It is an overlay upon the substance, not an inherent part of it.
<p>
&quot;To understand this, consider that
the image in a painting, and the emotional, mental, and spiritual
expressions built into the image, are not inherent in the paint
which the artist used. The pigments have certain qualities, yes,
but they are merely raw stuff of making, and it is only in their
artful combination that the higher purpose is revealed. That purpose
is never apparent to the consciousness of the atoms in the paint,
but only to creatures of the same or higher type than the creator.
It simply does not exist in the paint itself.
<p>
&quot;Thus also with the manifest portion
of the divine woman's substance. If her essence were to remain
in the manifest substance beyond the time when it has been prepared
as the raw material of a creative act, then the material would
attempt to respond to the higher purpose of the creator, and attempt
to build that purpose into itself. This is not desirable, for
if it attuned to one stage of the creative act, then it could
not properly respond to the later stages. 
<p>
&quot;It would be as if a glob of red
paint became infused with an indelible quality of &quot;violence&quot;,
so that it could never be used except in paintings of a violent
nature. Were the artist to attempt to use it to paint, say, a
rose in the hand of a young girl as an expression of innocent
appreciation of beauty, then the violence of the paint would send
the artist's intent awry. The artist wishes his material to have
just those generic qualities that make it widely useful, and no
more.&quot;
<p>
Here a pause of a few minutes.
<p>
&quot;Now is this woman, this Lilith
who takes all things into herself and gives them substance, too
much to be known within a single Part -- or even within a single
Aethyr. The Pan behind Pan is she; he is a silly country bumpkin
by comparison. Nuit she is, and Babalon of the Thelemites, and
many others; and none of these images touch even the hem of her
garment. The entire universe descends out of her womb, yet she
is not stretched or strained thereby. Time before time, Space
before space, being that precedes all being is she. One Mother
to whom the many Fathers apply themselves, she remains yet virgin.
No one truly knows her, yet all descends from her, is contained
in her, all is maintained out of her life.
<p>
&quot;Endless -- literally endless --
superlatives could be applied to her, and leave none the wiser.
Therefore will we cease. But she will come again, in many forms,
as we continue this path of the Parts. And she will come to you
again in time, as she has in past times.
<p>
&quot;We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
The appearance of Lilith in this vision
struck me as familiar, so I dug out my copy of <i>Vision and the
Voice</i> and re-read the section for ARN. There are some general
similarities of symbol, despite a contrast in the details. My
own symbol-set is substantially different from Crowley's, and
this of course affects the results. As well, A.C. was working
his way up through the Aethyrs, trying to force a return to unity
against the general flow of their force. Here we are working from
top to bottom, in line with the flow. 
<p>
The zodiacal king ruling this Part is
again Ziracah, Aquarius. Thus the opening image reflects the Water-Bearer
of the Tarot card. But there is a strong Saturnian element in
the aura of burden, oppression, and sorrow that surrounds her,
and this expands into a more general Binah nature.
<p>
The cry of the figure supports this
position; &quot;those above&quot; are Kether and Chokmah, whose
force descends and gives form to the unconditioned primal substance
of Binah. &quot;Those below&quot; represent the dispersal of the
Abyss, and the transformation from transcendental wholeness into
the myriad of finite events that make up existence in the lower,
non-transcendental spheres. She is neither one nor many because
the distinguishing characteristic of the primal substance is its
total <i>lack</i> of distinguishing characteristics. It is NOT
anything that can be comprehended or imagined by a finite consciousness.
<p>
Finally a minister of the Part appears
and (being like in nature to the Part) takes the place of the
woman for the completion of the transformation into finite form.
Just as the Saturn aspect represents a minor and lesser part of
Binah. The creation of a finite form having been completed, the
angel releases the remaining substance back into its transcendental
state by invoking the yet higher state of which it is a reflection.

<p>
My own conception of Lilith comes from
the goddess-religions of the age of Taurus; she has nothing of
the demonic aspects added by the male-oriented cultures of the
following Aries age and perpetuated by the fears of the Piscean
age. She is an aspect of Innana or Ishtar as All-goddess, specifically
the starry night-sky, as her name LIL-ITh might be translated
as &quot;night's essence&quot;. The last form she takes in the
vision before vanishing is the form of that goddess. This same
form appeared in Crowley's vision, but he interpreted it in terms
of the corrupted tale of Eve and the Serpent.
<p>
The function of the priestess of Lilith
was to attract men to the temple for the performance of the sacred
rites. In Thelemic terms, she is the priestess calling &quot;To
me! To me!&quot; And each woman, in her initiation into the temple,
took on the role of Lilith with some man, invoking her &quot;under
her stars&quot;, becoming the goddess for a period of time. Any
child issuing from such union was considered a child of the goddess
and some god, not of the human bodies through whom the act was
performed.
<p>
In the higher aspect represented here,
she is the primordial &quot;stuff&quot; out of which all creative
entities form their creations. The creative, &quot;male&quot;
counterparts are the multiple entities of the region Pacasna,
a multitude of Hadits to her Nuit. To make the connection between
Lilith and Nuit even firmer, the former name might be interpreted
as LI-LITh. &quot;LI&quot; means &quot;To me&quot; or &quot;unto
me&quot;, the call of Nuit; LITh means &quot;none&quot;, Nuit's
nature.
<p>
The remainder of the vision deals with
aspects of the divine creative process, and is best understood
through meditation. I believe that the overall nature of this
Part can be summarized as concretion of essence followed by release
of any excess essence.
<p>
This completes the regions of the Aethyr
ARN. 
<p>
It has occurred to me while re-reading
the visions that there is some connection with Achad's Tree being
developed here. The visions of LIL might represent the descent
of the creative force from Kether to Chokmah, via the path of
Jupiter. Thus representing the initial imbalance that results
from movement away from the Still Point. 
<p>
The first region of ARN, with its heavy
Saturnian flavor, is the secondary descent from Kether to Binah,
via the path of Saturn. Note the resemblance between the &quot;grid&quot;
of that vision, and the grid surrounding the hermaphrodite in
Crowley's version of the card, or the bindings of the wreath around
the herm in other versions.
<p>
The second region of ARN, strongly Aquarian-Uranian,
would then represent the passing of the male creative power from
Chokmah into Binah via the path of Aquarius. The final region
is Binah itself, the primordial stuff reflected into the lesser
area of creation that is the Earth.
<p>
Obviously, with 91 Parts there is going
to be a lot of overlap somewhere along the way, in any correlation
between them and the Tree. It seems more likely to me that the
Parts will only occasionally become congruent with the Tree, and
that the rest of the time they will touch on things outside that
matrix. <br>

<p>
Thursday, September 01, 1994 3:29 PM
<p>
Vibrated the Call and invoked the names
as usual.
<p>
The sigil of the Part stood before in
vision for a time; an air of aggressive presence radiated from
it. I absorbed some of this radiance into myself, and as I did
so began to see into another space behind it.
<p>
The second space was filled with light
of a bright, electric-green color, just slightly greener than
Mt. Dew soft drink. Within it were tiny flakes of another shade
of green, also electric, so that the overall effect was of a liquid
with particles suspended in it.
<p>
Nothing happened for a time, and my
thoughts drifted off into things I might add to the book. After
a brief time my attention returned, and I noted that my astral
body felt as if it were occupying the same place as the sigil.
Gradually the viewpoint drifted forward through the sigil. Turning,
I saw it as a gate into the space where I now stood. My viewpoint
was now split in two, half continuing to see the green space,
the other half in whatever place the gate of the sigil led to.
<p>
I vibrated the name of the Part for
several minutes. Nothing more happened. Finally I gave up on trying
to get the Part to manifest as a vision, and tried instead to
simply get its energies to come into my body. I withdrew all my
attention into my body and reoriented to this new purpose.
<p>
The effect was immediate and overwhelming.
I was hit with a flow of force that threatened to dissolve my
awareness into a swirl of particles and blow it away. For a few
moments I was so disoriented that I almost fell out of my chair.

<p>
Leaning back and closing my eyes, I
tried to relax my magickal body to accept the forces. For several
minutes there was chaos; the force, like an abrasive wind, whipped
away parts of myself that were not in tune with it, stripping
off parts that were attuned to lower levels of reality and leaving
behind only their higher-plane equivalents. 
<p>
Finally the worst of it was over and
I began to see clearly again. It was apparent that on some level
everything removable had been stripped away from me, leaving only
a skeletal structure of adamantine hardness. There did not seem
to be any pattern or balance to what remained; it was simply composed
of those parts of my structure too tough to be affected; within
my aura they formed a structure as random and jagged as the casting
of a deep-sea worm. 
<p>
The force continued to flow, and it
became apparent that these remaining parts were in some way either
restricting that flow, or casting a shadow such that I could not
see this Part clearly. Perhaps both. Worse, it was clear that
the very mind-set necessary to my visionary work was itself adding
to the restriction; perhaps my nature as a being was simply incompatible
with the forces here.
<p>
This constricting feeling became stronger.
I assumed the asana called &quot;The God&quot; in the hope that
this would allow a freer flow. It did not. Physical symptoms began
to appear -- shortness of breath, feelings of constriction from
my clothes, wristwatch, and glasses. After several more minutes
I got up, stripped off all of it, and sat on my bed in half-lotus.
This eased the physical sensations (but did not completely erase
them) and I could give my attention fully to adjusting to the
force.
<p>
For the next half-hour I gave my attention
to deliberately relaxing the parts of myself that were resisting,
one by one. Eventually I had to stop from exhaustion; the work
was that hard, and remained incomplete. I lay down and drifted
in a half-trance for a while, then got up and completed this record.
<p>
I am tempted to skip this Part and go
on, but I resolved at the beginning to do them in order, and it
seems best to continue, despite the difficulties. I would guess
that it will take at least two more sessions before I can penetrate
into the Part fully. 
<p>
Friday, September 02, 1994 1:17 PM
<p>
Vibrated the Call and appropriate names
as usual.
<p>
Upon vibrating the name Samapha, I became
filled with an energy much like yesterday's; power with a very
high vibration rate, which tended to throw off anything it contacted
that was not of a compatible nature. While still completely in
my body, it seemed that this power had somehow cast off parts
of my aura, leaving behind structures similar in function but
of a much higher quality. There was also a sensation of heat distributed
throughout my body, but particularly noticeable on the insides
of the thighs and calves.
<p>
Turning my vision to the astral level,
the first thing I saw was an image of the Tarot card &quot;The
Lovers&quot;. This lasted only an instant; a third figure was
added between the man and woman, and the background transformed
until it was the card &quot;Judgment&quot;. Specifically, the
version seen in Wang's G.D. deck. The angel was within a white
triangle surrounded by a circle formed from the Great Serpent.
<p>
(I suddenly understood that the green
field that opened yesterday's vision was in the flashing colors
of fire. The electric green would flash with red, and the darker
green flakes would flash with scarlet.)
<p>
Now a voice said: &quot;Judgment has
come; but what is it that is to be judged? A man? No. A demon?
No. Only that which is of the nature of the Fire can pass through
the Fire. As it is said: ultimate sparks of intimate fire.
<p>
&quot;That which is of the Earth is
not of us; nor that of the Sun, nor that of the Realms of Death
and Destruction; we are wholly within the highest. Power is ours;
power to create the world, power to destroy it again. We are the
essence of the divine creative will, personified and made manifest.
We descend from on high, and that which we touch is burned to
ash, burned to make way for that which is to come, in glory, from
the all-highest.
<p>
&quot;And shall you pass us, O man?
Not at this time; we speak not for the future.
<p>
&quot;We descend from on high, and everything
before us is laid waste. The gardens of Isis are desiccated and
burned. The might of Horus is laid low. The dissolving seas of
Set are evaporated into steam, which rises up into the sky and
disperses. The realms of Thoth survive, but are transforméd;
only glittering crystalline threads remain where once were living
thoughts of the purpose of god. 
<p>
&quot;Call us the Teeth of the Serpent.
For as the Serpent rises up the Tree, so his head is in Kether,
and his teeth clasp the Still Point. There is nothing manifest
that is closer to that point than we; for even though our Path
is not the first, yet our nature is not changed from the Point,
while those that descend to the left and to the right do deviate
in nature from the essence. Being of the path of balance, we retain
its nature.&quot;
<p>
(The vision had a tendency to dissolve
back into pure power, and this power kept building up in my magickal
body. I could not sit still, and went outside to sit on the grass
for a time, hoping the plants' vibrations would cool me off a
bit. Seemed to work.)
<p>
&quot;Now, the Serpent of the Tarot
card is not the serpent who climbs the Tree. The former has his
tail in realms beyond this world; and in wrapping himself about
the Still Point he becomes a sphere of sevenfold vibrations radiating
therefrom. 
<p>
&quot;And so are we, though wholly of
this world, the reflection of events beyond. As was the goddess
of the previous vision. 
<p>
&quot;Where she was the reflection of
the ineffable substance from which all things come, so are we
the reflecting of that which stimulates things to come out of
her. We are the serpents who wrap themselves around her outstretched
arms. The dual helical coilings they show are the nature of our
motion; spiraling down into the lower worlds, yet balanced because
we turn in both directions at once. And this is the swirling power
that you felt yesterday, stripping off the dross from your magickal
bodies, leaving behind only a pattern of god-stuff, for a time.
<p>
(Brief pause here.)
<p>
&quot;There are other aspects of this
Fire that descends from Kether; it takes on other forms as it
passes through the so-called Abyss, and as it approaches Tiphereth
below. That which destroys when confronted in its essence can
be the support of being when diluted. And the key to the vibrations
that make up the worlds; the sevenfold vibration of the Great
Serpent is reflected in the sevenfold nature of the lower worlds.

<p>
&quot;But these aspects are taken by
others; we ourselves are not the ministers thereof, but only of
the destruction manifested of pure divine will. Therefor is our
number 4400; the number of Fire and blood and sparks, but writ
large in the sky by the will of god. 
<p>
&quot;Take you of our essence, o man.&quot;
<p>
The visual aspect had faded while the
voice spoke. Now a cup of white gold appeared before me, upon
which was raised the image of the Greater Countenance enclosed
in a triangle, which was enclosed by the circle of the Great Serpent.
(Yet it seemed that the Countenance was somehow greater than that
which enclosed it.) The cup was surrounded by an aura, again of
glowing white.
<p>
I took the cup in my hands, and they
seemed stripped of solidity, so that from halfway up my forearms
there were only the ghosts of hands to be seen. I could not feel
the cup, but only a vibrating numbness.
<p>
For some reason I did not drink, as
is the usual custom in such instances. Instead I raised the cup
above my head and brought it downwards through my body from head
to toe. When it reached the bottom there was an upwards pull;
I moved it until the hollow of the cup was congruent with my heart,
where the pull stopped. I released the cup and it gradually dissolved,
releasing its fire into the magickal body.
<p>
&quot;We prepare you for that which
is to come. As you continue in these visions you will find our
power of use; perhaps not in any obvious fashion, but as support
and sustenance when none other is available.
<p>
&quot;For now, continue as you have.
You shall know when the time is right for each vision. Do not
seek to push too hard, do not be in too much of a hurry. For the
absorption of that which is gained shall make each further step
easier.
<p>
&quot;For now, farewell.&quot;
<p>
The energy of the Part remained, but
the sense of contact ended. And so I closed the vision and returned
fully to my body.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
The connection to Achad's Tree hinted
at in previous visions is here made overt. In that Tree, the path
of Fire connects Kether with Tiphereth. So these visions have
so far covered all the paths that descend from Kether, plus the
reciprocal path of Aquarius between Chokmah and Binah.
<p>
The aspect of Fire dealt with here is
entirely transcendental. As the minister indicated, there are
two other aspects of this path that will be dealt with elsewhere.
The ministers describe themselves in various cabalistic ways,
explained in the following footnotes where they are not obvious.
All of these indicate that the ministers represent the first extension
of the divine will into the Pillar of Balance. They are not Kether
itself, but are as close to it as it is possible for a manifest
being to come. 
<p>
Beyond this they hint at connections
to realms transcending even the Supernal Triad, as the complement
to the Goddess of the previous Part. The Sumerian theme is continued
by relating them to the Serpents on the arms of that Goddess.
Why they should use this ancient form is not known. I would think
that the modern Nuit and Hadit, with which I am much more familiar,
would be a better choice; especially considering the other references
to Liber AL. But their connection with Hadit is only hinted at,
subsumed into the older version.<br>

<p>
Sunday, September 04, 1994 1:35 PM
<p>
Vibrated the Call of the Aethyrs and
the appropriate names as usual.
<p>
The first image was of a man in bronze-age
armor walking from downstage right to upstage left. He wore greaves,
cuirass, helmet and arm guards, all finely detailed with images
of martial scenes. At his left hip he wore a bronze shortsword.
In the background I could hear sounds of many men marching in
order.
<p>
Gradually this image was overlaid and
supplanted by an image of the Tarot card &quot;The Tower&quot;.
Particular attention was somehow called to the gap between the
crown and the top of the tower, at the point where the lightning
strikes it.
<p>
A voice said: &quot;How shall the power
of the Mother be transmitted into the lands of the Son? Shall
it be as a torrent of water raging in a stream bed? No. Shall
it be as mighty winds hurling objects about? No. Shall it be as
an hundred mighty earthquakes that shake the world? Perhaps, but
not at this point. No. It shall be as a stroke of lightning which
burns the mortar of his castle to a dust of lime, and loosens
the connections between the stones. 
<p>
&quot;For was it not said to you, Our
god is a god of terror and wonder? Was it not said to you that
he shall destroy your dwelling places and make of them a place
for the beasts of the field? He shall stretch your souls to bursting,
tear the seams and threads that hold them together.&quot;
<p>
(While this was said I was flashing
on my own thoughts on this matter, explained in substantial detail
in the paper <i>Divine Creation and Initiation </i>and somewhat
in <i>The New Aeon</i>.)
<p>
&quot;What shall be said of this place,
o man, that you have not already understood to the roots of your
being? For you have gone through this process times without number,
and known the terror of its inception and the wonders that lie
at its end. Is it not so?&quot;
<p>
I said yes, it was.
<p>
&quot;Just so. And in the ending of
the life of man the life of god begins; there is no gap between,
simply blindness and unwillingness to look.
<p>
&quot;Now to explain briefly to those
who might read: The Tower is the Mind of Man, the Ruach, which
comprises all that he is as an individual. It begins deep in the
Earth and is built by the powers arising in the lesser sea, the
roots of emotions in Man. These are the urges of the physical
organism to survive, and grow. 
<p>
&quot;Very deep are these urges; they
originate in the cellular level and so are carried up through
all the levels of organization within the living finite being.
The cells have an intrinsic urge to coordinate and compete with
each other to form organs and bodies. Similarly, after many intermediate
levels, the various specialized parts of the mind have the urge
to form a complete self-aware mental being out of their disparate
functions and purposes. 
<p>
&quot;The process of initiation carries
this further; through conscious effort and direction, the mental
being so produced in turn increases the coordination and linkages
between the parts that created it. This is the prime function
of the Adept.
<p>
&quot;The end-result of this process
of coordination is a being whose entire finite existence is closely
tied together into a single functioning unit. This is the Tower
as we speak of it here.
<p>
At this point I felt we were getting
distracted from the essence of the matter, and cut off the vision
for now.
<p>
Monday, September 05, 1994
<p>
I seem to be having the opposite problem
with this part than I had with the immediately previous one. There
I had trouble entering; here, I am so thoroughly familiar with
the effects of the Part's power, and have internalized it to such
a degree, that the power tends to follow the existing paths in
myself rather than forge new ones. I recognized the process of
the Part instantly, and my recognition pulled the presentation
into established lines of thought. I felt that there was no point
in allowing the Voice to rehash things I could explain better
myself.
<p>
Everything that exists consists of many
lesser parts in a relationship to one another. In simple physical
objects the relationships tend to be relatively static. In living
beings the relationships are a dynamic homeostasis. Entities on
magickal levels -- including those we call the personality and
the soul or solar self -- are also complex systems in a dynamic
balance.
<p>
Whenever a new source of activity or
energy is introduced into a dynamic system, it produces a disruption
of the existing patterns of balance. Some relationships are broken
entirely; others are stretched out of shape and their action distorted.
The connections between all parts of the system become looser
and behave in strange ways until the new source is incorporated
into the system.
<p>
We see this on every level of human
experience. A new environment tends to make us anxious or puts
us into a heightened state of alertness until we can define our
relationship to it. An unusual object confuses our senses until
we become familiar with it. Social interactions in a group change
when a new member is admitted. And so on.
<p>
Initiatory magick is nothing more (and
nothing less) than a constant, willed repetition of this process.
The magician invokes some source of magickal energy, or some being(s)
existing on a higher level of organization than himself. The response
brings new contacts and energy into the complex system that is
himself, producing a &quot;mind-expanding&quot; experience, stretching
and breaking the habitual relationships between parts. Incorporation
of these new contacts and energies into the system produces a
new dynamic balance and a broader scope of perception. Certain
levels of organization are relatively stable, and relatively common
in group-experience; these we call &quot;grades&quot; of initiation.
<p>
In Achad's Tree of Life, the path of
Mars connects Binah with Geburah. And the movement from the latter
to the former provides the archetype of the process represented
by this Part. Like any other energy, the entrance of Binah energy
into the self produces a disruption and stretching of relationships.
Since Binah is a transcendental power, it cannot be fully absorbed
or integrated into a finite being. The integration must take place
within the transcendent realm.
<p>
During the initial inflows of transcendent
energy, and for some time afterwards, the finite self isn't capable
of actually perceiving them. All it can perceive are the effects;
a raising of awareness coupled with the &quot;stretching&quot;
of itself to a point of near-dissolution. This is the experience
of the False Sephira, Da'ath. 
<p>
It recognizes that something outside
its perceptual range is causing the effects, but cannot see those
causes; its internal relationships and library of experiences
are not the right sort to reflect transcendent events. Thus it
&quot;sees&quot; a gap in existence, a blankness beyond which
it cannot penetrate. This is the perception of the so-called &quot;Abyss&quot;.
Like Da'ath, it is an illusion or hallucination due entirely to
inadequate perception; it has no existence except as a construct
in the mind of some person. 
<p>
But the process of adaptation goes on
despite the blindness of the conscious self. The difference from
previous cases is that a configuration of internal relationship
centered around a sense of individuality, around a reflective
&quot;I&quot;, cannot absorb the transcendental powers. To integrate
them into the being, the parts that make up the individual self
have to achieve a permanently &quot;looser&quot; relationship
to each other, and become reoriented so that they respond directly
to the impulses coming from the transcendental levels. 
<p>
The relationships among the parts are
not greatly changed by this; everything that made up the individual
soul is still present and active. The only difference is that
the individuality that was created by their intense interactions
is superseded as governor of the being by the transcendental aspect.
It's importance gradually diminishes and it fades away.
<p>
It is the state of permanently &quot;stretched&quot;
connections among parts that is the essence of this Part of the
Earth. It's initiatory aspects are the most immediately important,
but it appears in many other aspects of existence as well. 
<p>
The analogous activity on the physical
level would be a solid heated to just below the point where it
liquefies. In the biosphere, it would correspond to the increased
activity in some kingdom of nature brought about by a sudden increase
in the available nutrients. E.g., a year with an unusually bountiful
crop of nuts and fruits would produce an increase in the population
of the animals that eat them. This in turn would create pressure
and competition among them for territories, an increase in the
population of predators, etc., all of which would require general
adjustments in the relationships among the biosphere's various
systems.<br>

Sunday, September 11, 1994
<p>
Procedural change: Up to this point
my procedure has been to simply vibrate the Call of the Aethyrs
and the names of the Zodiacal King, Part, and Aethyr, and allow
the vision to manifest in whatever way it happens upon. This has
produced a rather wide variety of presentations in the preceding
visions. 
<p>
In the hope of producing some additional
consistency, I am changing the procedure. Before vibrating the
Calls and names, I will enter a neutral magickal space and inscribe
a circle with a narrow border on the ground. In the center of
the circle will be the sigil of the Part, along with its name
in English and Enochian characters. In the border, at the top
of the circle, will be the name of the Zodiacal King in English.
In the border at the bottom will be the name of the Aethyr in
English.
<p>
The intent of this is not to make a
&quot;magickal circle&quot; in the normal sense. In fact, I will
stand outside the circle during the invocations. Rather it is
more like a talisman &quot;writ large&quot;, an attractor for
the forces invoked and an anchor-point. Any invoked force or being
will not be expected to stay within the confines of the circle,
but can move about or change the surroundings as appropriate to
their presentation.
<p>
Sunday, September 11, 1994  1:50 PM
<p>
Invoked Andispi according to the revised
procedure.
<p>
The image of the circle quickly gave
way to another space, wherein there was a big red valentine-style
heart, with a smooth, shiny surface like vinyl. An arrow was stuck
through the center of this heart from back to front. I got the
impression that there was a thin cord or thread attached to the
arrow.
<p>
The scene went into motion and the arrow
passed entirely through the heart. It then looped downwards and
again hit the heart, this time from below. It passed out through
the cleft at the top and again looped around to the bottom. It
repeated this procedure many times, each time leaving behind it
a loop of thread which billowed outwards from its attachment points.
Soon the heart was surrounded by lines like the lines of a magnetic
field. The arrow then vanished.
<p>
The voice said: &quot;Is it not said
that our god is a god of Love? And yet, what is Love? There is
the dove and the serpent, but are these all? No. The rainbow is
also a sign of Love, after another fashion. And it is this Love
that binds the universe together.&quot; 
<p>
(Humorous background thought of apologies
to Lucas and Spielberg.)
<p>
For a moment there was a flash of the
Great Serpent of the Judgment card seen previously. Now the Serpent
transformed himself into a circular rainbow, which pulsed, sending
off shock waves in the seven colors throughout the space. I thought
of a Cepheid variable throwing off a spherical shell of light,
and of the heart of a moment before, and understood that they
were representations of the same idea in different forms. 
<p>
&quot;Seven are the thoughts of God;
seven are the stars of the Bear, each a beating heart sending
one of those thoughts into the universe. The Dragon wraps about
them and basks in their light, warming himself at their fire.
He is heated by the thoughts of God until he glows with a white
heat himself, and must throw off that heat as light into the circle
that is the zodiac. And within this circle dance the Seven who
are gods to this world.&quot;
<p>
At this point I noted that my own aura
was echoing the pulses of the Serpent, and was surrounded by a
rainbow ring. My attention became wholly engrossed in the pulsing
radiance for a time, and thought stopped.
<p>
Gods, what a sensation! It was as if
my magickal body had become seven bodies, each of a different
color and note, and all my thoughts and knowledge, and all the
structures of my being, had been decomposed into these primal
notes and separated by their colors. No thought or perception
that required admixture of these notes could exist. No composite
things at all.
<p>
Each of these bodies was distinct, though
for the most part they moved together, one leading and the others
following after a few moments, giving an impression like the video
effect where motion of an object leaves a trail of ghost images
behind it.
<p>
&quot;Now,&quot; the voice said (and
my consciousness quickly collected itself), &quot;as it is in
the heavens, so it is on this world, within the range of being
called the human Tree of Life. The Dragon is concealed within
the Supernals; he absorbs the vibrations emanating from the Still
Point, and transforms them, stepping them down so that they can
make the seven lower worlds of the Tree. (I say 'he' but there
is no true sex here.) 
<p>
&quot;The Dragon is everywhere in the
Supernals, but his motion downwards comes primarily through the
path of the Arrow, from the sphere of Wisdom. For as the Solar
system gods are within the zodiac, so are the spheres within the
sphere of the Fixed Stars. (Save for Binah, who is both within
and without.) And you remember, o man, that upon a time it was
said to you that Saturn is properly Malkuth, not Binah.
<p>
&quot;This is the highest function of
the path of the Arrow. Now see the image as it should be for this
aspect.&quot;
<p>
The image of the Tarot card &quot;Temperance&quot;
appeared before me, but with some differences. The angel of the
card was enclosed within the half-circle of a rainbow, the ends
of which were at the level of the angel's elbows. There were no
mountains in the background, just the night-sky, with the Bear
and the Dragon visible through the arch of the rainbow. The circle
of the zodiac surrounds the figure and rainbow. 
<p>
The angel's arms formed an upright triangle,
forearms horizontal, hands with palms facing each others, separated
by about a hand's length. In front of him was a square altar,
on which stood a cup or grail whose vertical cross-section was
a downward-pointing triangle. From out the angel's palms flowed
two streams of rainbow liquid, which mixed together between them
and fell the short distance into the grail. 
<p>
&quot;You understand this aright. Explain
as you will, by your ingenium.&quot; (The voice had apparently
been monitoring my thoughts as I examined this image.
<p>
&quot;It is this last step, the admixture
of what was separated, that is rightly the place of Andispi. 
The separations of the thought of God were present in the previous
visions of LIL, but hidden in the general chaos of the beginning
of creation. They are here re-mixed in the moment of transmittal
from the transfinite to the finite aspects of existence.
<p>
&quot;Know you that it is the glory
made manifest that is our place, the heavenly powers brought into
the vision and being of men. We are pure still, not admixed, each
a different one of the notes of God's voice. Thus when we touched
you did the mixed become separated. That which passes through
us becomes mixed in its descent, as the Tarot image shows.
<p>
&quot;Now to other things: Pursue these
visions as you will, each in its own time.&quot;
<p>
Here the voice paused a while, though
the sense of contact did not diminish.
<p>
&quot;We are done.&quot;
<p>
I thanked the ministers for their presentation,
and closed the vision.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
Andispi is the first Part ruled by Lavavoth,
whose attribute in the system being used for this project is Sagittarius.
It's symbols play a large part in the presentation for this Part.
<p>
Sagittarius is an odd sign, with multiple
aspects. It is the sign of one-pointed focus towards a goal (represented
by the arrow). It is also the sign of what is erroneously called
&quot;synthetic&quot; thinking, usually with Gemini and Mercury
representing the opposite pole of analytic thinking. I say &quot;erroneous&quot;
because the Sag mode of perception and thought involves both taking
apart of perceptions (analysis) and joining or blending of multiple
perceptions (synthesis). The same is also true of Gemini.
<p>
It would be more correct to say that
Gemini deals with the object-like aspects of perception, while
Sagittarius deals with the vibration-like aspects. Within their
separate aspects, each has the capacity to distinguish salient
features of experience, and to make connections between experiences
based on those features. In this vision, these functions of Sagittarius
are shown as part of a more universal process, the one by which
transcendental powers are translated into finite events. 
<p>
We begin with a reprise of the Great
Serpent image seen in Samapha. As was said there, &quot;in wrapping
himself about the Still Point he becomes a sphere of sevenfold
vibrations radiating therefrom.&quot; That point is expanded here,
though the symbolism is a bit confusing.
<p>
The heart and the Cepheid variable are
similar in that they both pulse with a single rhythm. That is,
each has a single vibration, and could thereby be said to be the
archetype of a particular energy. One might associate them with
Kether, but I am not certain.
<p>
Having shown them, the vision expands
this idea and shows the stars of Ursa Minor as the seven manifest
vibrations of some invisible divine entity. BN OISh, Hebrew for
Ursa Minor, has the same value as ThBL, Hebrew equivalent of &quot;cosmos&quot;.
The shortened version OISh, also used by the Voice, has the same
value as RQIO, &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;firmament&quot;. This
can be taken as a confirmation that it expresses a set of universal
principles or powers.
<p>
The constellation of Draco spatially
&quot;wraps around&quot; the Bear, figuratively absorbing the
vibrations shed by the Bear's stars. In turn the Dragon re-radiates
and distributes the heat in a different form, bringing the cosmic
power down to the solar level in the form of the zodiac. And within
the Zero of the zodiac another seven powers move and act.
<p>
In Achad's Tree of Life, the values
of the paths connecting the Supernal Triad sum to 510. This is
the value of ThNIN, the Hebrew name for Draco. Thus, as the Voice
says, he is &quot;concealed within the Supernals&quot;, reflecting
the cosmic scheme down into our local scheme. As Ursa Minor represents
the cosmic &quot;thoughts of God&quot;, so Kether represents the
will of some entity existing outside the limits of our Tree. The
Dragon in the Tree transforms the power of Kether into a form
consonant with those limits, and sends it downwards through Chokmah
and the path of Sagittarius, which connects Chokmah with Chesed.
So we have a complete parallel between the cosmic and local schemes:
<p>
Cosmic  Local
<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>
A Hidden God, Still Point at the center
of Kether expressing through seven Suns
<p>
Constellation Draco 
<p>
Draco as Supernal Triad
<p>
Zodiac constellations Chokmah as Sphere
of the Zodiac
<p>
Seven Planets Vibrations that eventually
form the Seven lower Spheres of the Tree

<p>
In the modified Tarot image, the upward-pointing
triangle is the Supernal Triad; the downward-pointing triangle
is the second triad, and the square altar represents the &quot;elemental&quot;
worlds below Tiphereth. The overall symbolism of the image compresses
the two parallel lines above into one.
<p>
The vision of Andispi completes the
three Parts within the Aethyr ZOM. 
<p>
Comparison with Crowley's vision of
ZOM yields only one point of similarity: the symbolism of the
Great Serpent surrounding the Still Point. This takes only two
paragraphs in Crowley's account; the rest is concerned with confusion,
delusion, and various horrible versions of sublime images. One
might wonder at the differences, but should not be surprised.
It was Crowley's belief that the first three Aethyrs resided entirely
within Kether; his inability to penetrate them is thus somewhat
of a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is also clear from the footnotes
to <i>The Vision and the Voice</i> that Crowley decided <i>in
advance</i> what he should be seeing in each Aethyr, according
to a questionable set of attributes for the Enochian characters.
His results largely reflect his expectations, with the occasional
unusual insight forcing its way through a thick curtain of inappropriate
symbols. 
<p>
The current seer had a substantially
different view of the matter going in. What is surprising is that
the results have not conformed to my expectations to any great
degree. I expected to find a lot of differing powers, but all
of basically the same level of reality. That is to say, a &quot;horizontal&quot;
distribution like political divisions on a map, with varying customs
and themes in each &quot;country&quot;. Instead, it is shaping
up more into a vertical progression, though not so orderly a one
as might be expected; we are not following the paths in sequence
down the Tree. 
<p>
While not conforming to my expectations,
the visions are certainly conforming -- in a general way -- to
my knowledge and symbols. I have used Achad's Tree of Life exclusively
for almost a quarter-century; the symbolism of the G.D. Tree,
which figures so largely in Crowley's vision, is entirely alien
to my perceptions. But there are surprises as well; the Sumerian
goddess Inanna has not figured largely in my previous work, aside
from a few invocations of her Venusian aspect; the more cosmic
aspect here is new to me. The Great Serpent has hardly figured
at all; I discovered the connection to the Supernal Triad years
ago and could not make sense of it, and so forgot it.
<p>
The Parts in the Aethyr ZOM present
in essence three aspects of Fire: Pure, divine Fire in Samapha,
destructive Fire in Virooli, creative Fire in Andispi. These are
presented in terms of the three paths of Achad's Tree that descend
vertically from the Supernal Triad, and thus transmit the divine
will into the manifest worlds. Note that only the highest aspect
of each path is shown, that which has the greatest influence from
the sephira at the top of its length. If indications are correct,
we can expect that somewhere further on we will see Parts that
show the paths' powers with the upper and lower sephiroth in balance,
and with the lower sephiroth dominant. 
<p>
There are some odd reversals presented
among these aspects. The divine fire erases its creation; the
destructive fire dissolves into unity in Binah; the creative fire
of Love or Art, instead of unifying, brings about a deconstruction
of unity into a sevenfold diversity. No doubt much meditation
will be needed before I can explain this.
<p>
Examining the previously-done triads
of Parts, we see some continuing patterns. In each Aethyr, one
part represents a &quot;positive&quot; pole, another an anti-positive
(but not necessarily &quot;negative&quot;) pole, and a third that
balances or transcends them. An alternating &quot;vertical&quot;
polarity is overlaid on this: in the Parts for the First and Third
Aethyrs, the first Part in the sequence was the balancing form.
In the second, it was the last in sequence. There may be an additional
threefold connection among these first three Aethyrs as well.
The overall flavor of the first Aethyr seems to me to be more
or less neutral; the second Aethyr was clearly &quot;female&quot;,
the third clearly &quot;male&quot; in mode. We will see after
the next nine Parts whether this pattern continues.<br>

91, first of PAZ. Zodiacal King: Lavavoth  Ministers: 2360 Mundane
association: Thebaidi. (Thebes and environs.)</a>
<p>
September 15, 1994
<p>
While preparing the picture of the sigil
for this Part, I found myself unconsciously vibrating the name
of the Part and its Zodiacal King. Checking the astral to see
if anything had happened as a result, I saw the image of a downward-pointing
arrow punched halfway through a horizontally positioned thin disk.
The disk was colored like an archery target, in the spectral colors
but not in the spectral order; from the center outwards the colors
were yellow, orange, green, red, blue, indigo, violet. This puts
the colors in the astronomical order of the planets, save that
the Moon is in the outside circle. 
<p>
(A sourceless thought explained that
violet was Uranus in this case, not Luna, the latter being an
occultly &quot;dead&quot; planet at this level, and a mask for
Uranus at all levels.)
<p>
Later when practicing visualizing the
sigil, the image of a square, flat-roofed temple formed in the
square portion of the sigil, and the other lines became stone-paved
paths leading to the Temple. The final vertical stroke of the
sigil became a wider path or road running alongside a river. The
temple was somewhat generic in styling; made of stone, columns
supporting a roofed portico completely surrounding the enclosed
central portion. The columns had the papyrus-leaf headers of Egyptian
work, but nothing else was particularly distinctive.
<p>
When each of these things happened,
I considered starting the vision immediately. However, the timing
felt off, so I did not do so.
<p>
Monday, September 19, 1994  4:11 PM
<p>
Note: Uranus is currently transiting
square my Neptune, and inconjunct my Pluto. I have been experiencing
an unusual mental and physical excitation, somewhat similar to
an adrenaline rush, but extended over time. Don't know how this
is going to affect my ability to penetrate the part. My consciousness
feels somewhat distanced from things, compared to its normal states.
<p>
Invoked the Part according to the revised
procedure. 
<p>
My viewpoint tilted upwards so that
it was above the sigil, looking down. Behind the sigil I saw into
a space wherein the arrow-and-target described above was present.
It floated in a rich blue sky among clouds. 
<p>
Now invisible ripples seemed to move
out into space from the colored disk, like ripples on a pond.
These expanded and became spherical. Each ripple passed through
the Earth below, leaving behind a general vibration in the aura
of the planet. Continuing outwards into the solar system, they
expanded until they hit one of the planets, at which point they
disappeared and the planet sent back a strongly focused ray to
the Earth.
<p>
Examining the Earth more closely, it
seemed to be composed of a multitude of tiny, elemental-like creatures,
each of a different quality. It was these that were excited by
the ripples, not the physical substance of the planet. Their activity
increased and took on a churning quality, roiling upwards and
down again like the turbulence cells in a flask of boiling water.
I realized that these &quot;cells&quot; were the Parts, in their
horizontal aspect. 
<p>
The rays of the planets also appeared
to affect these cells of elementals. Some of the cells became
distorted from the ideal cylindrical shape, becoming mushroom-shaped,
or like an hourglass, or a stalagmite. Others bent in one direction
or another. Seen from far-off, there was a sort of pointillist
effect, or like a test for color-blindness where an image was
formed from dots of different colors. In this case, they spelled
out the word &quot;Life&quot;. (I heard the word &quot;ChIH&quot;
in the back of my mind as I read it.) 
<p>
The Earth rotated, the planets moved
in their courses, and the image shifted. Now the image of a woman's
face took up the entire surface of the world for a moment, seeming
as if seen through a gate into another space. The image shifted
again and the air above the planet seemed completely filled with
castles or cathedral-like structures. Each of these had a different
word above its gate, but I could not read them from this position.
<p>
Ripples went out again from the arrow
and target, repeating the previous movements. And again, and again.
Each time the structures covering the world mutated and transformed,
so that everything was in constant motion, but even the motion
was structured. (All of these things were formed out of the elementals.
I could see them like tiny, irregularly-shaped planes that shifted
and turned under the impact of the ripples and the rays. There
was a surprising economy in their movements; no one elemental
ever changed very much from its previous position, but the cumulative
effect of their shifts was a dramatic change in the overall structure.)
<p>
The force was getting washed out, so
I withdrew from the vision at this point.
<p>
Wednesday, September 21, 1994  3:31
PM
<p>
Performed the invocation as per revised
method. Very difficult getting into the visionary state -- think
the Uranus transit is still interfering.
<p>
Finally got in, and visualized the sigil
within a circle on the ground. After a few more minutes vibrating
the names, a cylinder formed in the air above the circle, and
within it there appear again the image of the Temple described
above. I was looking at it from the northeast, and in the middle
distance behind was a red sandstone cliff, with two great gods
carved into it, and an opening in the wall between them. Karnak?
<p>
A voice said: &quot;The Nile is an arrow
that passes between the gates. And at its midpoint of its travel
stands the Holy City, interpreting that which is above to that
which is below, and that which is below to that which is above.&quot;
(I took this to mean that, as Thebes stands between Upper and
Lower Egypt, so this Part stands between the upper and lower regions
of existence. I.e., between Chokmah and Chesed.)
<p>
The voice continued: &quot;Enter into
the Temple, o man.&quot;
<p>
I stepped into the circle and felt a
distinct difference in the quality of the power there. Very bright,
like intense desert light, but unfocused, without a center or
source. It permeated everything, and myself, without being disturbed
or diverted by it.
<p>
I was like Gulliver in Lilliput; too
big to fit the scenery. I tried reducing my size and could not
do so. Finally I shed part of my astral body and reformed a small
one to fit the scale of things. The larger part remained ghost-like
above the river.
<p>
I seemed to be in Egyptian garb, unintended.
A kilt made of red and blue panels, and a torc of gold with designs
in black enamel or inlay. Bare torso, skin a reddish color. There
was something funny about the shape of my head, but I could not
see it from outside.
<p>
Moving to the temple, I mounted three
shallow steps onto the portico. A tall square opening allowed
entrance to the interior. Entering, I was immediately struck by
a wave of power radiating from a statue in the center of the building.
At first I thought it was a reflection of the waves seen coming
from the target in the earlier vision, but decided I was interpreting
prematurely.
<p>
The statue at the center was a statue
of Set, seated in the asana called &quot;The God&quot;. He held
nothing in his hands. Concealed within his upright ears there
seemed to be the twin curves of the symbol of Uranus, with the
cross between them just above his skull, and the dependent circle
residing just behind his eyes.
<p>
The voice: &quot;Now is it given to
you to become the priest of the god Set, as you have been his
[some concept involving qualities of &quot;gate&quot;, &quot;bearer&quot;,
and &quot;avatar&quot;] in the past. You have stood before men
and upheld his power, even as they attempt to usurp his image
to their own designs. 
<p>
&quot;You stand between the higher and
the lower, combining both, as Set does so stand. Neither one nor
the other, your feet are in the worlds of men, and your head is
in the heavens; you blend them with Art where others cannot see
to link.&quot;
<p>
(All this time I was shifting back and
forth between a position in front of the god, and a position identical
with his. When outside his body I could hear the speech; when
inside all was silence, and a terrible concentration of force.)
<p>
&quot;And know that this is the sense
of the Tarot card of this Path. The angel stands with one foot
on the ground, which is the Four-fold Establishment of Chesed;
the other foot is on the Great Sea of Binah. He has taken up the
substance of both in his cups, and combined them through the formation
of vibrations, which are the waves that pass between the cups.
All this under the rainbow, as it is done. And in the background
above the mountain is the radiant spark of Hadit, the creative
impulse, in this case emanating from Chokmah. For who but a Magus
could wield the power of the Mother? Who else but a Magus could
stand upon her and not sink? 
<p>
&quot;Do you seek a Word to give to
men? Seek not; it is not necessary. For this task is above the
worlds where a Word is given to men; it is an Artful weaving of
the transfinite with the finite, the creation of a new link in
the chain of achievement, the opening of the path to the stars.
Not the establishment of a Power. No. Not the creation of a religion
or a guide for their lives, but the opening up of Freedom, full,
clear, and without restriction. 
<p>
&quot;Weave the substance with the form,
the divine with the world. Weave your threads together so tightly
that men cannot see through to the Abyss. Let the evil of separation
be banished, let it be gone forever. 
<p>
&quot;You are not leading men, but opening
the Door wide, and allowing them to pass through. And having come
out of the house of the Mother, where shall they go? Wherever
they will. None shall stop them or say them nay. The Greater World
is wide, and there are no further gates, nor boundaries. O men,
visit the many houses wherein the creators dwell; learn from them,
assist in their work. But if this is not desired, then build your
own house. 
<p>
&quot;Now, we who dwell here, in the
Thebes of the spirit, salute this work and He who conceived it.
Let it be done rightly and with straight ways. Amen.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
Thotanp is the second of three Parts
in sequence attributed to Sagittarius in the system used for these
visions. In descending Achad's Tree of Life, the path of the Archer
is the first to cross from the transcendental to the finite realms,
as the previously-viewed path of Mars is the first to cross in
ascending the Tree. 
<p>
In the Part Andispi, the highest part
of the path, dominated by Chokmah, was considered. The separation
of the divine light into spectral colors there suggests a wave-mode
equivalent of the division into independent points which represented
Chokmah in a previous Part. It also suggests the dispersion typically
attributed to the so-called Abyss.
<p>
Here the path is equally influenced
by Chokmah and Chesed. In Monday's vision, the separated colors
are re-organized and made into a single entity, represented by
the target. The outward-moving &quot;rings&quot; of power are
typical of the expansive quality of Jupiter. These have both a
direct and an indirect effect upon the Earth. The direct effect
transfers the divine will-aspect of Chokmah into the Earth as
an archetype in Chesed. The indirect effect, through the planets,
creates a dynamic state in which the archetype can be developed
and fully manifested over time. (Shown by the effect of the planetary
&quot;rays&quot; on the &quot;cells&quot; in the Earth's aura.)
<p>
This Part seems to show another factor
contributing to the state of conflict between the Parts, as shown
in the visions for LIL. The stimulation of the ChIH (attributed
to Chokmah) forces the Parts into a state of activity, with their
individual reactions to the stimulation producing the conflict.
Yet at the same time the Chokmah force creates a linkage between
the Parts, so that on a higher level their activity is coordinated.
<p>
Wednesday's vision translates the Chokmah
- Chesed linkage into religious terms. As in the first Part, the
Nile represents a flow of power from the divine towards the material
pole of existence. The deserts bounding it were related to the
pillars of Gemini in the first Part; here the Nile becomes the
downward-moving arrow of divine intent, passing through the &quot;gate&quot;
formed by those pillars. Upper Egypt becomes a metaphor for the
transcendental realm, Lower Egypt for the finite realms. Thebes,
at the point between, translates one to another. As the center
of religious power, it &quot;translated&quot; divine decree into
directives for mundane action. And at nearby Karnak and the Valley
of Tombs, the dead were &quot;translated&quot; from the mundane
realm back into the divine. Being a center of religious power,
it properly belongs to Jupiter, ruler of Sagittarius and Chesed.
<p>
(Note that Thebes is also &quot;in between&quot;
from an historical perspective; its time of power was during the
&quot;Middle Kingdom&quot;.)
<p>
The remainder of Wednesday's vision
becomes more personal, but maintains the theme of linkage between
the transcendental and finite levels. In one of the major themes
of my magickal practice, the god Set governs the golden rectangle
in the Tree of Life formed by the sephiroth Chokmah, Binah, Chesed
and Geburah. Thus his realm includes both finite and transfinite
levels of existence.
<p>
The seer's own nature is next said to
be identical to the god, though on a smaller scale. His task is
to erase the illusion of separation from the minds of men, showing
the transfinite and the finite to be one world, with no gaps or
breaks between them. (None of this is news to the seer; he has
been doing this for several years now.) The mention of the grade
of Magus is not an affirmation of an existing state, but a promise
for the future.

<a NAME="Axziarg">Axziarg or Axxiarg,
11th of 91 Parts, 2nd of PAZ. Zodiacal King: Lavavoth. Ministers:
3000. Mundane association: Parsadal (capital of ancient Persia).
</a>
<p>
Thursday, September 29, 1994  approximately
2:00 p.m..
<p>
Invoked Axziarg according to the revised
procedure.
<p>
My viewpoint rotated to above the circle,
and the center of the circle became transparent. Moving through
it, the first thing I saw was a man on horseback riding very fast.
There was no landscape around this figure. He wore leather clothes
and carried a large pouch on a strap across his shoulder.
<p>
My viewpoint retreated and a landscape
formed. He was riding southwest over a high plain, with a line
of mountains in the distance to the north. The viewpoint retreated
further and I could see that he followed a road leading from just
southwest of the Aral Sea to a point somewhat to the north and
east of the Persian Gulf. Descending again at this endpoint, there
was a city whose central portion was made of large stone palaces
and public buildings, surrounded by many other quarters of buildings
made of rammed earth or mud. Roads radiated out from the city
in all directions. I happened to notice that over one of the gates
to the central city, there was carved a figure like the winged
disk, save that the central disk contain some complex design with
a motif of rays -- possibly a stylized wheel? 
<p>
Now it seemed that the great Arrow of
the previous two visions was descending from the sky over this
city. Slowly but not ponderously it descended. As it came close
to the ground a great wheel of magickal force seemed to begin
rotating in some space coincident with the city. It rotated in
several dimensions at once -- &quot;a wheel turning upon itself&quot;.
 The closer the arrow came, the faster that wheel turned. The
arrow touched the ground, and dissolved into it; at the same time
the outer portion of the wheel's rim exploded into a million smaller
arrows of many colors, all of which flashed outwards over the
face of the earth. 
<p>
I could not see exactly where they landed,
but suddenly many other smaller wheels appeared, spread over an
area that reached to the Mediterranean in the west and into India
in the east. All these wheels were of different sizes and turned
in different directions and in different planes.
<p>
A voice spoke: &quot;In the end of its
journey, the power of the Arrow becomes the power of the Executive,
combining authority with communication to create coordination
among disparate parts. This is not the power of a King, for the
King draws all to himself and seeks to make it one under his command.
The executive's power is the power of Principle, or of Policy,
the ability to see the design whole, and to show to each part
the place in that design to which its nature fits it. Thus each
part remains independent in most of its activities, but works
those activities under the design.
<p>
&quot;And who is to say whether the
design or the part's nature dominates? For where greater design
and individual nature are fitted, there is no conflict. The lesser
acts according to its nature, and the design is fulfilled. 
<p>
&quot;Thus is the power of the Will
of God, the father-aspect, brought into the lower worlds. Those
who seek to impose some design on men, by Law or by Force, are
not at one with that Will; and thus do their schemes go awry,
in the end. For the Will is change, and the seeking of change
for the growth of Art; it never ceases to move and evolve. But
the rules of Law and Force seek only stasis, a prevention of change,
an eternal repetition of what has been already accomplished. 
<p>
&quot;There is no law in the Will of
God, save only this: Thou shalt change as your nature dictates;
thou shalt evolve, will you or not. And if you change beyond the
bounds of Law, what of it? Law touches only was has been; it does
not see what is truly new, but always lags behind. Leave behind
the definitions that Law places on reality; create new definitions
according to your nature and the Will. Law shall not see them
until they too, in their time, become established.&quot;
<p>
(The sense of this paragraph is that
one circumvents the restrictions of established reality by creating
a new reality in which its restrictions are irrelevant.) 
<p>
&quot;O man, you who hears these words,
so too must thou do. For the work of the divine is a creative
work; one cannot rely on the thoughts of the past to create the
future. The following of teaching is for those on the Path [of
initiation], those who do not yet know the will of God direct.
This is right and proper, for the Path is a traveling in blindness;
a groping through concealing thickets wherein the goal cannot
be seen. Those who tread it have no knowledge of what is to come
to them or of what they seek, and therefor have no recourse but
to seek out the signposts and markers of those who went before
them.
<p>
&quot;But you have stepped out of the
thicket into the limitless fields of the divine, wherein every
direction is good, and every step opens up an infinite number
of new directions, all of them good. Freedom is yours, the full
freedom that the gods have among themselves. But what shall you
do with it? Shall you stand in one place, frozen by the multitude
of choices open to you? No. Move you must, and move you shall.
<p>
&quot;No guides are there to direct
your course, no authorities to trammel your will or limit your
choices. Creation is the only rule here; Art the only goal, Change
the only means. You must throw off all the limits and rules of
the past, even those of the divine Mother. She is not the creative
power, but the stuff of creation. Therefor those who are at one
with her are not creators; they only wait. [That is, the state
of stillness characterizing the Masters of the Temple is not a
creative state. See Crowley.] To create you must break that oneness
again, and become a star in her firmament, a power that makes
her substance the material of your Art.
<p>
&quot;Like every creator, you must speak
the One Word: Amgedpha!
<p>
&quot;Take your place in the company
of stars. Nine years ago were you lifted into the arms of the
Mother, and presented to the gods. Nine years ago were you held
up as you took your first steps within that world. For nine moons
of moons have you worked there, and proven that you could stand
there unassisted. For nine years have you been the One who is
None; now you must become the None who is One. 
<p>
&quot;Take your place. And how shall
you do this? Thou shalt will it, and it shall be so.&quot;
<p>
&quot;We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
This is the last of three Parts in sequence
associated with Sagittarius. Following the interpretation suggested
in earlier Parts, it represents the lowest aspect of that Path,
which connects Chokmah with Chesed in Achad's Tree of Life. Therefor
the Chesed influence dominates here. 
<p>
The capital of the Persian Empire is
fitting for this part, since the governance of that empire had
much in common with the conditions described here. The empire
was held together by a large system of post roads, and a sophisticated
messenger service similar to the American Pony Express. The rider
who opens the vision is a symbol of both Sagittarius and this
link of empire.
<p>
The capital city of the empire is seen
as the hub of a Jupiterian wheel, and then as a different sort
of wheel, a chakra. Under the stimulation of the incoming divine
will from Chokmah, this wheel first becomes energized and then
radiant. Its radiation stimulates the activity of other chakras
within the &quot;body&quot; of the empire. Each of these lesser
chakras is a  Persian satrapy, which takes the power of the central
wheel and transforms it according to its own nature. This is in
keeping with the Persian practice: overall policy was set in the
capital, but the policy was generally adapted to the customs and
needs of the regions and their special ethnic groups. 
<p>
This blending of disparate regions under
a single policy is a social equivalent of the synthetic aspect
of Sagittarius. The mental equivalent is the abstraction of meaning
from different ideas or experiences and unifying them in a meta-idea,
something which connects to them, but exists on a higher level
than the things it connects. In magickal work, this aspect is
seen in the way in which many seemingly unconnected things, such
as colors, divine names, geometric symbols, Tarot images, etc.,
become unified into the experience of a particular &quot;pure&quot;
magickal power.
<p>
The presentation next segues into something
which is not strictly connected with the nature of the Part. It
seems to be a contrast between Chokmah and Chesed on one hand,
and Binah and Geburah on the other. The nature of the Father or
Will aspect is set against that of the Mother; the nature of one
is to change, the nature of the other is to support and maintain.

<p>
The remainder of the vision gets personal.
There was a great deal happening that was not recorded, because
it was non-verbal and non-image-like; it will take time to absorb
before it can be translated into words. It is obvious that the
ministers are setting me up for initiation into something like
the grade of Magus. There are enough connections between what
they say and events over many years (and things I have been thinking
in the last few weeks) to make such a step seem appropriate. The
idea is so attractive that I am tempted to resist it out of principle,
as being too good to be true. But I did that the last time this
sort of thing happened, and later regretted that I had done so,
wishing I had instead thrown myself into the spirit of the moment,
and left evaluation for afterwards when the powers had subsided.
For the moment I will simply wait, keep inner silence, and see
what happens in succeeding Parts.
<p>
The &quot;One Word&quot;, Amgedpha,
is an Enochian word meaning &quot;I begin anew.&quot; The English
of this word was first used to me by the Enochian angels in a
series of twelve short meditations called <i>The Zodiacal Round</i>.
These meditations deal with the zodiac as the steps in the divine
creative process. The first verse, attributed to the name ORO
and the sign Pisces, reads:
<p>
And God said: &quot;The time has come
to create again. Let the old forms be washed away. I begin anew.&quot;
<p>
Shortly after, I was converting Laycock's
Enochian dictionary into a database, and discovered the Enochian
word. I have no idea of the context in which it was given to Dee.
<p>
The event mentioned in the following
paragraph occurred during the series of explorations recounted
in <i>Touring the Earth Tablet</i> and <i>The Book of the Seniors</i>,
and represented my first halting entry into the Supernal triad.
Neither then nor now did I consider that event to be an initiation
into the Binah grade; by my own standard, that initiation was
accomplished less than two years ago. 
<p>
The lunar symbolism also connects to
events of that time. One evening I was told, out of the blue,
that some important but unspecified event would take place in
a certain number of lunar months, and that in the interim I would
learn to &quot;stand on my own&quot; in the Supernals. My memory
says that I never did &quot;hear&quot; the exact number of months
involved. But counting the lunar months from the end of the Earth
Tablet working to now, it is about six months less than nine lunar
years, or about 111 lunar months. Since 111 is the value of ALP,
Aleph, The Fool, the last sentence of this paragraph serves as
a confirmation of this calculation, given before I did it. 
<p>
The &quot;One who is None&quot; refers
to the relationship between the finite solar self and the transcendental
being of Binah, whose nature is Not. This relationship occupied
most of my attention during the period mentioned. The &quot;None
who is One&quot; refers to the transition from Binah into Chokmah.
Having become Nemo or no-one, dissolving himself into the no-thing-ness
of the Mother, the Master of the Temple must now reformulate himself
as a star, a creative point of power in Chokmah. <br>

<a NAME="Pothnir">Pothnir</a>,
Part 12 of 91, 3rd of PAZ. Zodiacal King: Arfaolg   Ministers:
6300 Mundane association: India (Pakistan and India south and
west of the Ganges)
<p>
Friday, September 30, 1994  2:00 PM
<p>
Began to get images as soon as I formulated
the intention to invoke Pothnir.
<p>
The first of these images was like the
Tarot card The Sun, with some modifications. The sun in the image
was still smiling, but an intent fierceness overlaid its original
beneficence. There was no crown to the hill within the wall; it
had vanished and only an emptiness remained. Below the hill the
male and female children still danced with hands linked, but now
they wore costumes representative of Life and of Death. And those
costumes switched from one to the other with great rapidity, so
that I could not tell which of them was truly Life, and which
Death. 
<p>
The second was of the Ganges, seen from
space above India. It was oriented so that it was more or less
horizontal to my point of view, with its mouth in the Bay of Bengal
to the right, its origins in north central India to the left.
Gradually this image was overlaid with one of the Tree of Life,
and the river was identical with the path connecting Geburah and
Chesed.
<p>
Now I vibrated the Call of the Aethyrs,
and invoked Pothnir according to the revised method.
<p>
The circle disappeared, and I was in
a city in India, looking at it from a point in the center of the
river. Stone steps lined the bank in front of me, and these steps
were filled with people coming down to wash in the holy river.
Some were penitents, holy men, or mourners dressed only in loincloths
and smeared all over with ashes. Others were families in colorful
garb, carrying bundles of flowers or baskets of fruit and food;
some made sounds with bells, cymbals, and other instruments. Mourners
and celebrants alike entered into the river and began to wash
themselves.
<p>
There was a sense of intense heat in
the air, sourceless, as if the sky had caught fire and was radiating
heat downwards from every point of its area. And the sunlight
was equally intense. The heat penetrated everything. With the
non-living things, it passed right through. Among the living,
those who were not in the river seemed to absorb a certain amount,
but then began to re-radiate it, forming a spherical shield that
protected them from absorbing more. But with those who were in
the river, the water carried away the heat as fast as it was absorbed,
so that while the people did not contain any more of it at any
moment than those on land, a great deal more of it passed through
them. Each, according to their needs and desires, was cleansed
and sanctified thereby. 
<p>
I knew without seeing directly that
somewhere upriver others were burning the bodies of the dead,
and throwing the ashes into the river; or simply tossing in the
coffins unburned. I sensed that even further upriver was a palace
or seat of governance. And at the very headwaters was a survey
tower, built by the British as a benchmark point for their mapping
of the continent.
<p>
At this point I sensed that I was still
too washed out from yesterday's invocation to get much more here.
I decided to end the vision and try again another time.
<p>
Sunday, October 02, 1994  1:50 PM
<p>
Vibrated the Call and invoked the Part
per the revised method. During the Call, I &quot;heard&quot; a
multitude of voices echoing the words as I spoke them.
<p>
The voice said: &quot;What is creation
but the em-body-ment of the Will in the shifting streams of Life
and Death? The Sun arises and dies daily; the moon dies monthly
and is reborn. The Serpent sheds its skin in season, rising anew
from the shards. 
<p>
&quot;The ideas and thoughts of men
also have their time, bursting with vigor onto the scene, living
their life, becoming outrun by the changing world, dying and drifting
downwards in the waters to become the sediment out of which future
dreams spring and grow.
<p>
&quot;So too with the thoughts of God,
though their season is long and many men come and go before its
time is run. Think you that a single life, a single mind, might
embody all of even one of God's thought? It is not to be. 
<p>
I saw again the Ganges with the people
there. But now it seemed that those people were all of humanity,
living their lives out. Their various cycles were out of phase,
so that at any moment there were always a great many in every
possible stage of their cycles.
<p>
The heat beating down on them was the
will of the divine. And while that will was one and remained one,
it became many in touching the people. In each one it touched,
it dissociated part of itself that was fitted to the person's
nature and phase. And at no moment was the will of the divine
fully expressed even by all of those it touched together. 
<p>
The people went through their cycles
of life and death, and as they changed the parts of the divine
will that touched them also changed; a particular thread of that
will might continue with one person for a time, and then jump
to another person, only to be replaced by another thread in the
first person. All of them were constantly acting out a portion
of the divine will, but it was not always the same portion. Nor
was its manifestation in them constant; it changed as their cycles
changed them.
<p>
It seemed that only after many generations
had come and gone was the will completely expressed. It unfolded
gradually in time, reached a peak at which a great many of the
people seemed to resonate with a single vibration, and then faded
again. And another thought of God was waiting to take up those
who were no longer needed to express the old one.
<p>
&quot;There is no Word that man can
speak, that expresses the complete will of God for a time and
place. Such are merely aspects of the will that have greater force
in the attention of men at that moment; a great many other aspects
also are present and operating, but the consciousness of Man does
not see them clearly.
<p>
&quot;You yourself have seen powers
operating in this time whose range of expression and effect dwarfs
that of Thelema, or any other 'magickal Word'. You have tried
to describe them for men, and in the end admitted failure; their
scope was even beyond the range of your vision. 
<p>
&quot;Knowing this, o man, can you think
that in your time of true magehood you will do better? It is a
consummation greatly to be wished, it is true, but it is not to
be. Not for you, or for any man. And if this is so with respect
to the god of this world, how much more so will it be when you
enter into the greater universe, and bring its powers to bear
upon this world? 
<p>
&quot;No. Thou hast made the Gate, and
will become the gatekeeper. But the keeper cannot know all that
passes through his realm and places of power. You cannot stop
the suns from shining through the gate, save by closing and sealing
it. And that you will not do, for it would defeat your purpose.

<p>
&quot;Most of those who pass through
will do so unannounced, will work their effects, and depart again
unremarked. This world will be touched by many, and be the better
for it. Neither we who are the ministers of God, nor those into
whose ranks you were admitted in the late time, can do anything
about this. Nor would we wish to, remarkable as that might seem.
For you work not for us, nor to our purposes, but to those of
yourself, and one other. And in this, she is the ruler whose word
is law.
<p>
&quot;Now, as you descend again into
the worlds of men, passing through the Parts of the Earth, there
will be many and various things said that will be of interest.
Continue on.
<p>
&quot;We are done.&quot;
<p>
I ceased to seek either vision or voice,
but the altered state of perception produced by the Parts power
continued for a time. Nothing more of interest appeared before
it faded.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
This is the first Part governed by Arfaolg,
whose attribute in the system being used is Scorpio. But the content
of the vision seems to be rather a combination or intersection
of the Path of Scorpio with the Path of the Sun. The first two
images seen are an explicit statement of this.
<p>
In Achad's Tree, the upper hexagram
sometimes symbolizes the daily path of the Sun, the four inner
triangles with apices in Tiphereth, Geburah, Chesed and Kether
representing the quarters of the day. The path of Scorpio connected
Chesed with Geburah, and represents the horizon, the point of
transition between the upper world and the underworld, between
the lands of the living and the dead. 
<p>
In the vision, the Ganges becomes another
metaphor for this path, watery to fit the element of Scorpio.
The intense daytime heat of India becomes the power of the Path
of Sol, which intersects Scorpio's path in its descent from Chokmah
to Tiphereth. 
<p>
The image might well be a representation
of the process of incarnation. Those who are not in the river
absorb only so much of the Sun's power, and then achieve a state
of relative stasis. Those who have entered the river, whose lower
halves are in the worlds of night, of incarnation, have connected
themselves to both poles of existence. Power flows through them
and thereby transforms them.
<p>
The last image of Friday's vision simply
uses real landmarks along the Ganges as symbols for other paths
that cross or touch the path of Scorpio. Those tossing coffins
into the river are the path of Fire, the palace is the path of
Capricorn, the tower the path of Mars.
<p>
Sunday's vision jumps back up the path
of Sol towards Chokmah, showing the same scene from the transcendental
viewpoint, and uses it to show some more ideas pertinent to the
task of a Magus.

<p>

La<a NAME="Lazdixi">zdixi, Part 13 of
91, first of LIT.  Zodiacal King: Olpaged  Ministers: 8630  Mundane
association: Bactriane (Northern Afghanistan, southeast Turkemenazi)</a>
<p>
While memorizing the names and sigil
for this Part, I got an image of a large outcropping of rock jutting
out from a grassland. The image went into a time-lapse mode. The
grasslands dried out under the sun and turned to desert. The wind
blew away the sand from around the outcropping, making more of
it visible. Finally the wind eroded the outcropping until it took
the form of a crouched lion, like the Egyptian Sphinx.
<p>
Friday, October 07, 1994  approximately
2:30 p.m.
<p>
Invoked Lazdixi according to the revised
method.
<p>
The circle opened, and through it I
could see a region of what would be called &quot;high plains&quot;
in America. High plateaus interspersed with rolling hilly country.
Sparse grass covered the flatter portions, with clumps of low
bushes present, usually on the downhill sides of large boulders.
Overall the region appeared arid, though a river could be seen
running from west to east at some distance to the north. The sun
shone with great intensity, but the air was cold, and a biting
wind blew from the east. 
<p>
A camel caravan appeared from the southwest,
moving northeasterly to intersect the river. I could see the point
it was aiming for; the river spread out and became shallow over
an area of fine gravel. Obviously a well-used ford.
<p>
My viewpoint moved around to the north
of the ford, looking south. A long line of forbidding mountains
could be seen there, tapering off into more plains in the west.
The land in between all sloped gradually in my direction. 
<p>
Now the image of a lion's head appeared,
huge and ghostly above the mountains. There was a strong impression
that the spirit-lion held all this land as its territory, but
that it held itself aloof, not deigning to insert itself into
events there. A strong Leonian emanation came from it, and I spent
several minutes just attuning myself to it and absorbing it. 
<p>
[Looking back a week later, my memory
gives the impression that the mountains were the body of the lion,
so that it was half spiritual and half material. Or half transcendental
and half finite. There is a sense of this lion crouched over the
trade route like a house cat dozing over a trail of ants; aware
of the movement in front of it, but not terribly impressed by
it. None of these impressions were present at the time of the
vision; they appeared only when I examined my memory of it.]
<p>
The caravan reached the ford and began
to cross. Suddenly the ground began to shake in an earthquake.
The rumbling and roaring seemed to contain the lion's voice hidden
within it. The gravel of the ford shifted, and one of the camels
became mired in it to the knees, breaking its leg in the process.
Several other camels broke away and began a panicked run to the
south, directly towards the lion. The remainder were brought under
control by their handlers, who held them still and waited out
the quake.
<p>
The camels who had run eventually fell
into fissures opened by the quake, and died. The handlers took
what was useable from the camel in the river, then killed it.
The loads were rearranged on the remaining beasts, and the caravan
continued to the northeast, towards Samarkand.
<p>
Now the voice spoke: &quot;The voice
of the Lion is the voice of the Sun, ruling over the wastelands
of the spirit. Those who seek to cross his territory do so at
their peril, for though he does not act or speak of himself, yet
the whole world does speak with his voice. Even his own Word is
imperiled therein, for the world cares not, but acts according
to its nature.
<p>
&quot;Oh ye who seek the spirit of God,
beware! Oh ye who seek to bring the spirit to Man, beware! For
herein are the material and the spirit of God both shattered into
a million fragments in the shaking of the Voice. Can you hold
your place, O Man, in the quaking of the world? Is your will steady
and free of attachment, o Mage? If not, then all your works shall
be as naught.
<p>
&quot;That which arrives at journey's
end is not that which began the journey. A child of that beginning,
it may be, if all is done aright. But never is the thing itself
brought undisturbed and intact through the travels. Look you:&quot;
<p>
The scene changed to a more abstract
plane. I seemed to be in some occult space which refined reality
into a few essentials, sort of a laboratory miniature. To one
side of the space, a diagram of the Tree of Life stood, as if
as a key for reference during experiments.  My viewpoint was at
Chokmah, looking down the path of Sol towards Tiphereth. 
<p>
What I saw next is difficult to describe
meaningfully, though I saw it clearly.
<p>
First a concentrated point of Will was
ejected downwards along the path of Sol. About a third of the
way down, it seemed to hit an invisible wall and shattered. Sparks
flew out in all directions along curving paths, like the trails
of subatomic particles in a cloud chamber. 
<p>
Next, a &quot;beam&quot; of Will was
directed downwards. It was clear to my senses that the directing
entity had the intent of producing a specific effect or form on
a lower level, and was trying to control the way in which its
will moved so as to produce that effect. Again, it reached about
a third of the way down the path. This time the &quot;beam&quot;
was split up into many different beams of different colors. These
beams passed through the area of dispersion and recombined on
the other side. They did seem to produce some effect there, but
the effect was clearly not what the will-er had intended. I got
the impression that it was distorted or perverted to the point
of uselessness.
<p>
The third event was the most difficult
of all to describe. It seemed that this hypothetical will-er was
again sending downwards an intent to create; but this time it
reached only so far as the point where the others dispersed. There
it spread out into some pattern which did not directly reflect
the original intent, but did maintain its cohesiveness. 
<p>
But at the same time, this creator somehow
caused a stimulation in the sphere of Tiphereth, producing a directed
energy which rose upwards towards the midpoint. The effect this
energy produced was an active willingness to respond to the downward-directed
will, and to convert it into a form on the lower levels. This
power of responsiveness rose up until it was almost at the same
level as the pattern of Will. As they touched, all the finite
substance in the area immediately re-configured itself so as to
accurately reflect (as far as possible) the Will's pattern. This
reconfiguration started at the point of contact and worked its
way downward, changing at every level, until it came back to Tiphereth
and manifested there as a centralized, cohesive entity. I got
the impression that this final entity was exactly what the original
intent had wanted produced, even though the intervening levels
did not seem to reflect the original intent, but only the pattern
it had created.
<p>
(I know I am not saying all this right,
but it is the best I can do.)
<p>
The voice continued: &quot;The meeting
place between the finite and the transfinite is a problem not
only for those who seek to cross it going upwards, but also for
those who, from the higher level, seek to create something in
the world. The will alone cannot truly create, for the stuff of
the world has its own nature that does not, as yet, fully reflect
that will.
<p>
&quot;Thus in the first instance, when
a creator simply formulated his will in its most compact form,
and sent that will into the world, it did shatter and fail. And
in the second instance, when he sought to control the manifestation
directly across the interface, did it also fail.
<p>
&quot;For an act of creation to succeed,
it requires not only the [transcendental] Will, but an active
readiness in the stuff of the [finite] world to respond to that
will, to relate to the intent of that will and bring its various
elements into a relationship which reflects that will. 
<p>
&quot;This directed readiness, this
willingness to relate and to shape itself to the Other, is what
we call Love. It arises not from the instincts or the emotions,
or the intellect, but only from the heart. The Will alone will
always fail, as will Love alone; neither by itself can fulfill
the needs of Creation. But together, they produce the flowering
of all Creation. Thus it is said that &quot;Love is the Law, Love
under Will&quot;. 
<p>
&quot;Now, this combination may be attained
in several ways. For those incarnate creators, such as yourself,
it is often the case that his own being serves as both poles of
the equation. He stands simultaneously in both the finite and
the infinite. From the latter, he directs his creative will down
into the worlds; from the former, he generates the magnetism of
the heart that causes the world-stuff to respond to and reflect
that will. 
<p>
&quot;The great god Heru-Ra-Ha is the
symbol of this. For he contains within himself Had, a god of Chokmah
as we have previously seen, and Ra, a god of this path of Sol,
and Horus, who is the Son, and therefore Tiphereth. He is the
archetype of all true creators, who stand in both worlds at once.
(There is another, related interpretation of Him, as you know.)
<p>
&quot;Other great creators choose not
to embody both poles in themselves. Instead, they themselves stand
wholly within the transcendental realms, sending their will downwards.
And they seek out disciples, cooperating beings of a lower level
of initiation, to be the lesser pole. The combined souls of these
disciples, seeking to respond to the divine impulse of (as they
think it) their deity, bring down and manifest the creative impulse,
through their love of the divine. 
<p>
&quot;Of this second sort, the creation
of the Thelemic current of magick is the best recent example.
For Crowley, though he claimed to be the Magus of the current,
was not truly its creator; he was only the prophet, the fore-speaker,
who brought word of this creation into the minds of men, showing
them that there was an opportunity available to participate in
an act of divine creation. It was not Crowley's work, but the
response and the seeking of those who heard his words, that truly
established the Thelemic current. 
<p>
&quot;We have said enough for now, and
see that you have business that must be attended. Re-invoke later,
if you will, or stop and comment upon what has been said. But
think also on this in your meditations, for if you are to become
a true creator you must understand it fully within yourself.
<p>
&quot;We are done.&quot;
<p>
(Continuing about 3:45 p.m....)
<p>
&quot;Now there are many and subtle
things that might be said about this Part, but we will say only
a few.
<p>
&quot;First the Tarot Card, which reflect
in its own way the principles which we speak of. For at the top
of the card is the Sun, the creator shining the light of his will
onto the lower worlds. And below him is the ring-pass-not which
divides (and unites) the transcendental and the finite realms
from each other. This ring is being torn down by such as yourself,
and will vanish in future times.
<p>
And below the ring, is there not the
symbol of human love? Male and female joined together in joy and
love, in the delight of play under the Sun. And is not the play
of children commonly so, that they take some vision of things
as they are in the world of adults, and act it out within the
more limited reach of their own realm? They take the will-to-be
of the adult, and make it their own will-to-become, exactly as
the disciple takes the will of the creator. 
<p>
&quot;Thus is love under will expressed
in this card.
<p>
&quot;Another thing to be considered
is the reason why creation always stems from the transcendental
level. Those who act on lower levels do not truly create, save
when they receive an inspiration from the divine, and translate
it into the worlds as Art. All else is simply the repetition of
patterns and capabilities already present, mere elaboration, however
marvelous it seems. 
<p>
&quot;The substance of the four worlds
of matter -- that is, of the physical, astral, intellectual and
image spheres -- is purely responsive. Its responses are marvelously
complex, but without the continued insertion of power from some
outside source, they quickly devolve into inertness. Thus if the
power of the sun were withdrawn from the earth, all would eventually
freeze and die. Similarly on the inner levels.
<p>
&quot;The substance of the three worlds
of relationship, of Love, are more active in their seeking, but
their nature is to transfer power from above to below, not to
generate it themselves. They create an intermediate vehicle for
the divine will, a vehicle which in its turn stimulates the material
worlds into activity. &quot;
<p>
(This vehicle is a soul or some other
centralized entity in Tiphereth. A soul magnetically influences
the stuff of lower worlds, causing it to bring a creation into
matter.)
<p>
&quot;New things do arise within the
lower worlds, for the elements of chance and randomness are intrinsic
to their nature, and the interactions of various created beings
and things produce many complications and elaborations not inherent
in the original impulses of Will that created them. This is the
lower nature of Horus, Ra-Hoor-Khuit, in which conflict between
beings causes an endless unfolding of unusual aspects of creation.
But these must either be in line with one of the existing currents
of creative activity, or must be seized by some creator for the
potential he perceives in them. Otherwise, they live for a time
and dissolve back into the general noise of existence.
<p>
&quot;The transcendental Will is the
only source of new creative activity within any of the worlds;
being transcendent, it is not limited, has no defined characteristics,
and therefore can go beyond what is to what may be. The lower
worlds are all defined; they are substance containing definite,
and therefor limiting, natures. Each can only act in accord with
its nature. But the Will modifies that nature, adds to the capabilities
of the substance, makes them more than they were.&quot;
<p>
At this point I felt the power was waning,
and decided to cut things off.
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
According to my atlas, the opening scene
is an accurate description of conditions in the Bactrian region,
though no doubt the image was somewhat compressed compared to
the reality.
<p>
Lazdixi is the first Part to be governed
by Olpaged, Zodiacal King of Leo in the system being used. But
the vision clearly relates to the path of the Sun, which connects
Chokmah with Tiphereth. The aspect of that path being considered
here is somewhat higher than that seen in the previous Part, Pothnir.
<p>
The Bactrian region is used as a metaphor
for the Wasteland, an equivalent of the so-called &quot;Abyss&quot;
in certain versions of the Grail myth. A portion of the ancient
trade route to China becomes the path of Sol. And a ford in a
river becomes the functional equivalent of the false sephira Da'ath,
where things fall apart. Note the fine gravel, the shattered remains
of previous destruction. 
<p>
A caravan becomes either a creative
impulse moving downwards into matter, or a human soul reaching
upwards into the spirit; all depends on the viewpoint chosen.
Samarkand, central stop of the trade route, is the goal of this
caravan, so probably it is an impulse moving down to the central
sephira Tiphereth.
<p>
A sphinx rules over this wasteland;
and like the traditional sphinx, it challenges travelers. Not
with riddles; the sound of its voice is apparently a sufficient
challenge. But there is a riddle implicit in the situation nonetheless,
as shown in the abstract lessons that follow. The riddle is, how
to send a creative impulse of divine Will from Chokmah into the
lower worlds, in such a way that its intent is not destroyed in
the region of the Abyss?
<p>
The abstract lessons show that sheer
force of Will is not enough, no matter whether that will is sent
in a single pulse, or as a continuing flow of will-to-control.
A complementary impulse, originating from below, is required for
the Will to make itself known in the finite worlds.
<p>
Some difficulties in the transit from
the divine to the finite levels are discussed, and it is shown
how these are overcome through the Thelemic law of &quot;Love
under Will&quot;. The phrase is shown to not only be a philosophical
principle, but a necessity of the process of divine creation.
And that this is true both for the lone Magus, and for beings
of higher levels.
<p>
(As a practical matter, I believe this
vision indicates that the proper mode of creation involves sending
energy from the heart chakra and the ajna chakra into the throat
chakra, and there combining them, so that the voice of the mage
embodies both their powers.)
<p>
The part following the interruption
is educational but not terribly significant, IMO. There was a
lot shown that was not contained within the words, and which I
couldn't translate or retain myself. So the potential import was
lost.
<p>
As an aside, it might be noted that
the Bactrian region was historically one where shattered order
was the rule. Under the Persians it was chronically rebellious,
splitting off from their empire several times. It was one of the
last regions conquered by Alexander the Great prior to his death
and the dissolution of his empire. 
<p>
And today, as northern Afghanistan,
it is a region where tribal and, even more, family loyalties are
given a higher place than any larger community. Towns and cities
in the region are really nothing more than collections of family
enclaves, walled off  from each other and guarded with a zealous
paranoia. This fragmentation seems to me to accord with the conditions
given in the vision. As one American reporter remarked on returning
from the region, &quot;The Russians should have known better than
to invade a place where people fight wars for <i>fun</i>.&quot;

<a NAME="Nocamal">Nocamal, 14th of 91
Parts, 2nd of LIT. Zodiacal King: Alpudus  Ministers: 2306  Mundane
association: Cilicia (Southeast seacoast of Asian Turkey, abutting
the Gulf of Alexander)</a>
<p>
Friday, October 14, 1994  10:12 PM
<p>
Invoked Nocamal according to the revised
procedure.
<p>
The vision opened, and I seemed to be
a giant standing above the Earth. Below me I could see a fertile
crescent of plain bounded on the north and west by mountains bordering
a plateau. To the south was a sea; I could see waves traveling
leagues to strike the shore and be refracted back again. More
mountains, more like large hills, to the east.
<p>
My body shrank so that it was closer
to the scale of what I was seeing. To the northeast, there was
a deep gorge cutting through the mountains. To either side of
its entrance high rocks jutted upwards like pylons or weather-worn
pillars. The sky was overcast here, but bright light shone down
the gorge from the other end.
<p>
Coming down the gorge was a procession
of men, going in pairs. All of them wore belted robes with the
hoods thrown back; the robes were a rich violet color. Their headgear
was red, and came in many styles. Before them, riding on a white
horse, came Death with his banner, as in the Tarot card. 
<p>
Death reined in between the pillars,
and the men continued on, one of each pair passing to either side
of him. As they came into the plain, the spread out to either
side so that they formed a crescent with its points facing to
the southeast. Death now moved somewhat forward, so that he was
near the focus of the crescent, and lowered the banner he carried
in the direction he faced. On the banner was a stylized silver
rose, and this rose was exactly at the focus. It seemed to me
that the line of the gorge, plus the curve the men made, plus
the circle of the rose together made the symbol of Pluto.
<p>
A power seemed to radiate outwards onto
the plain. Like Pluto's force, it worked underneath the surface.
Above ground, it was merely a great brilliance; below ground,
it worked as if drawing or pushing things irresistibly upwards
into the light of day. 
<p>
Now hands and feet and heads began to
appear out of the ground. Soon people were pushing and dragging
themselves out of the ground, like drowning swimmers who had just
dragged themselves out of the water, and stood there gasping for
breath, in sheer amazement at still being alive. These all faced
Death and bowed deeply.
<p>
Death raised his banner again and set
it in a stirrup or cup on the left side of his saddle. He spoke:
&quot;It is not my power that has raised you up; only the gates
of passage are mine; the lands beyond are otherwise, and there
will you go.&quot; And in an instant all present (except Death
and his men) were transported to the other end of the gorge, from
which the light earlier shone.
<p>
Here it was bright all around, with
a sort of red-tinged brilliance. I could see no details of the
land. But above in the sky was a great angel, arms held out and
down at 45 degree angles, left leg crossed over right, so that
he formed the symbol of alchemical sulfur. Somewhere behind his
head shined a star, like one of the fiercer of the stellar brethren,
so far away that it had no disk, but so brightly burning that
it was nearly blinding. And around this star shimmered a ring
of vibrating rays, of all the colors, concealing the Great Serpent.
This ring gave the impression that the angel had a halo, but I
knew it was not so.
<p>
I waited for a few minutes more, but
nothing more seemed to be forthcoming, and there was no Voice.
So I ended tonight's vision, to try again tomorrow.
<p>
Saturday, October 15, 1994  6:44 PM
<p>
As the vision opened, I was high above
the plateau seen before. Below I could see many people streaming
out of the gate to the lower seacoast plain, following a path
that went through the relatively barren land here. But only a
portion of the path was visible; as it passed northwards, it --and
everything else -- dissolved again into a brilliant featureless
glow that covered the north from top to bottom.
<p>
As the people moved north, they too
seemed to dissolve. First their bodies became reduced to a series
of connected reflective planes -- sort of a Picasso-like or post-modern
rendition of a human body. Then these too dissolved, and as they
approached the glowing region, they became sparks of fire and
passed through. 
<p>
I followed the sparks into the glowing
region, and found that it was not a region at all, but simply
an interface. I felt like one of those medieval images of a monk
traveling through the spheres of the pre-Copernican heavens; he
breaks through the sphere of the fixed stars and is suddenly confronted
with the glory of God. But here that is reversed; I broke through
the seeming glory of the divine, and beyond it is the blackness
of space, filled with stars. The sparks coming through with me
waft away on an invisible breeze, transforming into stars among
the many already there.
<p>
&quot;What is it that draws the souls
of men upwards, o mage? Do you think it is the Will of God? It
is not. Do you think it the encompassing nurturance of the Mother?
It is not. No, it is the pure, unaltered fire, the essence of
Being, reaching down into the created worlds and pulling itself
to itself. For all things created are, at their root, Fire; and
Fire speaks to Fire.
<p>
&quot;Take away that Fire, and creation
dissolves into nothingness. Bring that Fire, and creation also
dissolves, but after another manner, gradually, and with the gains
and experience of its many lives retained. 
<p>
&quot;Now, in this Part, as in all the
others, we are concerned not with powers and principalities, not
with things, but instead with transitions and relationships, the
movement [emphasized] from one state to another. And what greater
movement is there than this, the drawing of souls out of matter,
and their return into the heavens from which they came?
<p>
&quot;Fire is Life. This is the word
of Chokmah. But Fire is also Light, and this is the greater word
of Kether. The one creates, the other returns, and brings about
return. And who can say if they are truly two and not one? Not
I, nor any of my kind.
<p>
&quot;In the early stages of this vision,
you saw the hidden Fire, that fire which is at the core of all
finite things. And the power of Pluto is like unto the power that
draws those fires out of their insulating nests, their comfortable
abodes, and frees them once more to stand above the worlds.&quot;
<p>
Here my attention was directed back
to the moment in yesterday's vision when Death radiated his force
into the Earth. Then it was focused upon a single particle within
the Earth. It seemed to me that in this state the sparks of Fire
were in a form of stasis, or a deep sleep, in which they did not
expend any of their intrinsic energy. When the Pluto-like energy
touched a spark, it was brought into a state of activity and began
expending its energy. Its &quot;insulation&quot;, its material
form, somehow sealed it off from drawing in more energy to replace
that being spent; thus the sense of drowning -- more properly,
suffocation -- that I had noticed. The spark (which is a human
soul, in some cases) forces itself upwards in order to have free
access to that which it needs to renew itself. 
<p>
&quot;In the next stage of the transition,
the sparks are free of their containers, yet retain the memories
thereof, and the patterns of action established there. They live
within the greater Fire, and draw sustenance therefrom, but are
still in some ways not purely of fire themselves. Here the greater
Fire acts to reduce them, to abstract them burning out the dross,
purifying, converting the memories of matter into patterns of
energy. This is the reduction of life-experience to a set of symbolic
relationships, as is done by those in the so-called &quot;adept&quot;
grades, which the Thelemites call the &quot;Lover&quot; grade.

<p>
&quot;And eventually even these are
burned away, turned to vapor and dissipated. And there is nothing
left but a spark of Fire, indistinguishable from any other, indistinguishable
from the Greater Fire itself, but still unique. And this spark
passes back into the realms from which it was sent in the beginning.
<p>
&quot;Thus, you might call this Part
the Part of Sublimation by Burning. That which enters under its
power is made more rarefied, closer to its own essence, by the
power of Fire. 
<p>
&quot;There is nothing here of great
import to your personal work at this time; you have seen this
power at work many times before, and the lesson has been learned.
In the future you will see it again, but not yet.
<p>
&quot;And thus we complete this vision
of the Part. We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
Here we return again to the Path of
Fire, connecting Kether with Tiphereth in Achad's Tree of Life.
But at a somewhat lower level than in the previous contact. What
was seen here covers the path's action in the region between the
two horizontal paths it crosses: that of Aquarius between Chokmah
and Binah, and that of Scorpio between Chesed and Geburah.
<p>
The sigil of Nocamal bears a surprising
resemblance to the shape of the Part's mundane association. The
starting point of the sigil would be at about the location of
ancient Antioch; the next two lines would be the seacoast of Cilicia,
the remaining lines the Taurus Mountains separating it from the
rest of Anatolia. Tarsus, the city of the apostle Paul's birth,
would be just about at the point of the sigil's upper &quot;v&quot;.

<p>
The gorge of the opening image and its
gate-like entrance are a poetic rendering of the Cilician Gates,
a pass through the mountains that was, and still is, one of the
main routes into the middle east from Anatolia and Europe. Here
it is used as a metaphor for the Path of Fire. The connection
with Paul is perhaps apropos, since a blinding light is seen later
in the vision.
<p>
As in the Part Pothnir, the vision suggests
an interaction between the descending path and the path it crosses,
so that the Fire is transformed by the Scorpio influence into
a generative or re-generative power. The &quot;dead&quot; are
raised up out of their coffins of matter, as in the Tarot card
&quot;Judgment&quot;, but this is done through the process of
death itself, acting as a front for the fiery power. 
<p>
The final image of Friday's vision confirms
the path being dealt with by showing a somewhat modified image
of the Judgment card. Some elements from the previous vision of
this path are repeated to affirm that it is a continuous process.
<p>
Saturday's vision continues the confirmation.
The people pass through the gates and enter into the Wasteland,
the region of the so-called Abyss. Beyond the Wasteland there
seems to be only light; perhaps an expression of the way the divine
is perceived from the finite levels. But the light turns out to
be another front; from &quot;above&quot; the Abyss, the divine
is seen not to end in some conclusive oneness, but instead opens
up into a region of infinite possibilities. 
<p>
The Voice explains the remaining aspects
of the vision well enough.<br>

<p>
Saturday, October 22, 1994  12:14 PM
<p>
While memorizing the sigil, I got an
image of what seemed to be a river between two lands. It was rather
narrow along most of its length, but spread into a circular lake
towards one end. And as the waters left the lake again, they spread
out into very many small channels, like those in a river delta.
This picture then became more abstract, the river banks turning
into two lines like long-handled spoons with the hollows of their
bowls facing each other.
<p>
Invoked Tiarpax according to the revised
method.
<p>
A voice said: &quot;Is this the Sun
among us, who shines with the glory of God, yet to the Earth is
as a light of comfort? Who among us would have this light for
his own, let him only look up, and it shall shine upon him. 
<p>
&quot;To no one in the world is it denied.
Nay, even if he shall be in the caves of the Earth, it shall shine
and warm him, giving hope in despair, encouragement in seeking,
joy and life everlasting in the finding.  
<p>
&quot;This is the Sun who lights the
Earth, giving to her elements the spirit that binds and raises
them.&quot;
<p>
While this was said I was surrounded
in vision by shimmering curtains of light, like auroras brought
down to earth, constantly in motion.
<p>
&quot;Would you penetrate the curtains
the divide the Earth from the Sun, o men? (Not you, o seer.) It
is easy; simply become like the Sun, giving of yourself without
thought of self, or of return. No other way is as quick, or as
certain. For the light of the Sun is the Love that encompasses
all without exception, giving freely; not because it desires return,
or desires to be raised up by others, but simply because its nature
is to do so. 
<p>
&quot;If you make distinctions among
those to whom you would give, then there is failure. For to distinguish
is to exclude, and the Sun excludes none; neither does it make
any difference between one thing or another. It shines, as it
is said, on the just and the unjust, on the sinner and the saint,
on the man and on the woman. Therefor do you also, if you would
rise into his realm.
<p>
&quot;Now rend those curtains before
you, o mage.&quot;
<p>
I performed the sign of Rending the
Veil. And suddenly before me stood the Great Table of the Elements,
but as I had never seen it before. The Table had multiplied itself
in all directions, forming a lattice that filled all space and
time. And each square of all those Tables (which were still one
Table) was a living world in itself. And it seemed that every
one of that near-infinite number of squares was connected to my
own body; not a one of them was left out, and no part of my being
remained unconnected to them. Similarly each was connected to
some aspect of the Earth, with not one aspect left unconnected.
Soon the difference between body and squares diminished, and it
seemed that there was nothing but the Table, the activity in its
squares, and a mysterious aware &quot;something&quot; that bound
them together.
<p>
I remained in this state for quite a
while; I didn't count the minutes.
<p>
&quot;Do you understand the concept
of sacrifice, o men? When the divine threw down into matter those
sparks of itself that became men and women, it was not a fall.
There was no sin involved, no rejection of the divine. How could
that be? For they were the divine itself. And when those souls
further threw themselves into matter, again it was not for rejection
of that which is above, but for the saving of that which is below.

<p>
&quot;Every life of every man and woman
who has ever lived has been a sacrificial act, aimed at the saving
of the matter of the world. 'Saving' in the sense of bringing
it out of the state of inert negativity into a state of activity;
then bringing it into a state of alignment with the divine will.
And eventually, bringing it into a state where it is itself indistinguishable
from the divine. Many aeons of time will this last task take;
and all the men and women of Earth will be long gone to other
realms before it is done. But it is begun here, and much has been
accomplished.
<p>
&quot;Every man and every woman is a
savior, whether they will it or not, whether they know it or not.
Every act that takes place within the worlds of Earth is a saving
act, serving that purpose no matter what it seems to them. Those
who are selfish, even those who are exclusively evil in their
acts, they still serve this end. Their mere presence, as suns
within the world, serves to make them so. By binding themselves
to matter they bring the light to it, within the limits of their
individual power; they raise up that matter, teach it to remain
in an active state, make it more responsive to future acts of
the divine will. And so it shall go.<br>

<p>
Sunday, October 23, 1994  12:43 PM
<p>
&quot;Now, you have known in past times
that certain portions of the Tablets of Enoch are dedicated to
the purpose of saving matter, of bringing it into a spiritually
active state as described. And in another did you see -- and act
upon -- the certainty that the Tablets as a whole are dedicated
to the Great Work. Is not your tower of light founded upon this
notion?
<p>
&quot;Yet be aware that the Tablets
as a whole, the Great Table, take, in a sense, the position of
the Sun with respect to the worlds of Earth. Just as the sun shines
down upon all from above, so too are the powers of the Tablets
a light that penetrates the earth at all points, but does not
originate therein. The angels touch the earth, but they are not
of the earth; their realms connect to it along a dimension that
does not impinge greatly upon the events that take place there,
but only upon the energies that support those events.
<p>
&quot;This is a difficult saying, I
know. Let me try again. 
<p>
&quot;The Tablets and their angels and
powers, they are the distributed and elaborated form of a divine
concern for the earth that is, in its essence, a great, singular,
solar Love. The power of that Love is freely given to men, without
conditions set thereupon; they may take it and make use of it
as they will. The one who created the Tablets and Calls is like
the sun described yesterday; it makes no distinctions upon whom
it shines, nor does it seek anything in return. 
<p>
&quot;Yet those who use the Tablets
and Calls, as you have done, inevitably find themselves being
touched by that being's Love, and they become (each within their
momentary limits) the vehicles and channels of that love; as it
is said, pouring down the fires of life and increase continually
upon the earth. The greatest of them become identified with that
Love, and with the one who expresses it; they seek to become as
that being, making themselves over into gods, seeking to create,
in their own ways, an equivalently powerful expression. Have you
not done this yourself, in your recent previsions?&quot;
<p>
(The Voice speaks of some thoughts I
have had -- really visions of possibility -- in which I had thought
of means of bringing down the divine light into the world in such
a way that it would bypass all the constrictions that existing
structures in the four worlds place upon powers that pass through
them. I was trying to find a way to bring that power directly
into the roots of things, so that they would be illuminated from
within, so to speak. Not until this moment had I connected these
thoughts with the way the Enochian god has set up its creation,
though my ideas were the same in essence.)
<p>
&quot;As to whether and how you will
succeed in your seeking, I know not; it is not within my power,
or that of any in this place, to see. 
<p>
&quot;Continue on in your exploration
of the Parts. There is much more to be seen in coming weeks and
months.
<p>
&quot;We are done, and bid you to fare
well.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
Tiarpax connects with the city of Alexandreia
Oxiana, which lies on the Oxus river between the ancient regions
of Bactriana (see Part 13) and Sogdiana, current-day Uzbekistan.
The Oxus drains west into the Aral sea, and Oxiana is rather far
from the river's delta, so the opening image could not relate
directly to the physical properties of the region. However, the
city was one of Alexander the Great's easternmost outposts, intended
to be a mustering and jump-off point for conquests further to
the east. Perhaps the images relate to the flows of men into and
out of the city, rather than to flows of water.
<p>
The presentation that follows the image
is clearly related to the path of Sol in Achad's Tree, and is
probably our final visit to that path is this series, assuming
the close connection between Tree and Parts continues. The zodiacal
king, Zinggen, is related to Pisces in the attributes being used
for this work, and his influence probably accounts for the concentration
on the Love aspect of Sol, and the avoidance of the more common
Kingly symbolism.
<p>
The presentation is unusual for being
almost entirely verbal, with only one image in the body of the
&quot;vision&quot;. There were a great deal of unrecorded non-verbal,
non-image-like perceptions in the background, but these related
mostly to my personal work.
<p>
Sometimes profound truths become so
common that they are trivialized in the public mind. More intelligent
persons reject them as platitudinous, outmoded, or evidencing
lack of thought among those who propound them. In our time this
has happened to the idea of love as a means of spiritual achievement,
especially among those in process of separating themselves from
the burden of Christian thought. It is perceived as &quot;white-light
fuzzy bunny&quot; spirituality, suitable only for &quot;small&quot;
or relatively &quot;unevolved&quot; souls.
<p>
But this is not the case in fact. No
less a personage than Lao Tzu recommends precisely this method
as the means of achieving the highest spiritual states:
<p>
Men and women who wish to be aware of
the whole truth should adopt the practices of the Integral Way.
<p>
These time-honored disciplines calm
the mind and bring one into harmony with all things.
<p>
The first practice is the practice of
undiscriminating virtue: take care of those who are deserving;
and also, equally take care of those who are not.
<p>
When you extend your virtue in all directions
without discriminating, your feet are firmly planted on the path
that returns to the Tao.
<p>
  -- Lao Tzu, _Hua_Hu_Ching_
<p>
Magicians should consider just what
it is they seek out of initiation. Isn't it the achievement of
states of being ever closer to the &quot;positive&quot; pole of
existence? Some might perceive that achievement in terms of increasing
power over events, others in terms of union with the divine, others
yet in terms of increasingly inclusive perceptions of the nature
of existence. Yet in every case it is movement towards that pole
that is the means.
<p>
And what is the state described here
but the achievement of a completely positive relationship to existence?
Power flows outwards without conditions or expectation of return.
Exclusiveness, specificity, and expectation of return are all
aspects of the &quot;negative&quot;, receiving pole of being.
To the extent that one of us wants a particular result from our
use of power, wants to gain something for oneself out of a magickal
act, to precisely that extent one is separated from the achievement
of the ultimate positive spiritual state.

<p>
Friday, October 28, 1994
<p>
Several times in the last few days,
I have tried to penetrate this Part, and found extreme difficulty
in doing so. I had sensed even before beginning that there was
something strange about it, and so attempted to get some contact
with the energy before trying to get a vision. It was not so much
that the energy was hard to summon; it came when invoked. The
problem lay in identifying my consciousness with it.
<p>
The first impression I got of it was
of a windstorm of flame, a fiery version of the dust-devils seen
in the desert. Along with this impression, there was a sense of
wild abandon, which brought to mind thoughts of dervishes, and
of gypsy dancers.
<p>
When I tried to identify my awareness
with the energy, I found myself being thrown away from it, with
a sideways vector, as if I had been grabbed by the whirlwind and
thrown away again. I kept trying, and found that with a little
effort, I could focus my awareness in the still center of the
whirl. But it required an absolute centering of my attention in
the root of the sahasrara chakra, and complete detachment from
the normal activities of the mind; I had to keep a state of complete
stillness. The moment my attention moved away from the focus point,
I was thrown out of the center of the whirl and spun around it.
Even the small relaxation of focus necessary to summon a vision
was enough to upset the balance.
<p>
I spent an hour on each of the last
two nights practicing that focus. Each time I achieved a state
where the consciousness dissolved totally into the energy. Everything
that distinguished me as an individual disappeared, and there
was nothing left but Fire. (I don't know if this qualifies as
a form of samadhi or not.) Awareness of time's passage vanished;
when I came out of the state I was surprised to find the roughly
twenty minutes had passed. To my internal clock, it seemed like
no more than thirty seconds or so. 
<p>
Coming out of the state each time, it
felt like my energy-body was entirely flame, an orange-red conflagration
enfolding and penetrating my physical body. My heart rate was
accelerated and irregular, my temperature felt a little elevated,
and I was covered in a thin film of sweat. I was panting as if
I had run a long way. 
<p>
Possibly in reaction to this, I now
find myself slightly reluctant to try entering the Part again.
I've put off starting several times already today, on the faintest
excuse, and a couple of times with no excuse at all. (In fact,
I'm going to do so again as soon as I save this file, and play
Nethack for a few minutes.)
<p>
Saturday, October 29, 1994  2:09 PM
<p>
Invoked Saxtomp according to the revised
procedure. 
<p>
Immediately I got a sense of the Part's
power, as a rod or beam of fire stabbing downwards through my
body. Similar in some ways to the &quot;king's beam&quot; in my
Enochian Temples, but without the helical torsion. There was also
a sense of compression, as if the beam were squeezing down as
it got closer to its lower end, which also manifested as a feeling
that I could not breathe. I did pranayama for a few minutes while
vibrating the name of the Part internally. The pranayama quickly
made me dizzy, so apparently there was no real problem with the
amount of air I had been getting. My physical body developed the
&quot;tingly&quot; sensation that is common with some Hindu discipline
I once learned, but the name of which I've now forgotten.
<p>
While concentrating on the physical,
I lost sight of the sigil in its circle on the astral. I reformulated
it and invoked the names again.
<p>
&quot;Now the Fires of God have come
into the Earth; for the Sun in Tiphereth is the fifth element,
and therein is the Elemental conjoined with the Spiritual. 
<p>
&quot;That Fire, that originated in
the Still Point of Kether, once again becomes the Point, at the
center of the circle. It is concentrated by the power of Pluto
concealed within the Path of Death, and injected into the worlds
of the elements as the Scorpion injects its poison. And like that
poison, it pervades the body, killing it, but only in preparation
for a new life to come. Not one part of that body can remain alive,
if the spirit within is to rise up.
<p>
&quot;But the power of God descends
upon Tiphereth not only through the path of Fire, but also through
the paths of the Sun and the Devil. And it is these three conjoined
that are the reason for the whirling power you sense in this place.
Now look:&quot;
<p>
Before me I saw a desert coast somewhere
in northern Africa, sand coming down directly to the water. Some
way inland there was a great whirlwind of fire, standing still
in the wasteland.
<p>
The vision changed, and now it seemed
that Eblis was standing in the whirlwind; indeed, he was the whirlwind,
but took on a quasi-human shape above it as well, a djinn formed
all of flames and heat, laughing in great delight.
<p>
A sound of music came up, music of the
sort usually associated with the Arab countries in movies. A drum
provided a jerky, polyrhythmic beat; some sort of stringed instrument
gave a droning continuo; and a squealing woodwind glissaded up
and down the scales in quartertones.
<p>
Two figures appeared outside the whirlwind,
one dressed all in black, the other in white. They wore loose-fitting
pants and shirts, and scarves covered all of their heads but the
face below the eyebrows. And it seemed that the rings holding
the headcovers on were really crowns.
<p>
These two figures danced around the
whirlwind. Or was it dancing? Each held a swords and moved it
in katas as it circled. There was great violence in their movements,
but also great style, as if each step had been choreographed and
practiced to perfection.
<p>
The music became more and more frantic,
and the figures passed around the whirlwind with greater and greater
speed, until they were blurred beyond distinguishing. One caught
a fleeting glimpse of a form occasionally within the blurring,
but its clothing was neither one nor the other, but instead was
some varying shade of gray.
<p>
&quot;Confound their understanding with
darkness, says the Call. And so it is; not the darkness of Night,
but the darkness of inescapable Ignorance. For the divine is in
their world, but they see it not; they see only the illusions
of the mind. And thus it is God himself who is the Deceiver.&quot;
<p>
Now many seekers came up and surrounded
the whirlwind and the blurred ring of the speeding dancers. (They
could not see Eblis.) I could see them wondering and talking among
themselves, saying &quot;Surely this is the divine itself before
us.&quot; And one by one, from various points around the circle,
individuals would rush forward and dive into the blur, shouting
&quot;Allahu Akbar!&quot; But they were instantly thrown out again,
to land tumbling in the sand. Every one of them, as they sat up,
had on their faces an expression of awe and wonder, and in their
eyes was a piece of the Fire. Others of the seekers gathered around
each as they stood, and the awed ones began speaking with great
animation of what they had seen.
<p>
After five or six had jumped in and
been ejected, it became apparent that not one of them had seen
the same thing within the blur. Persons who moved from one group
to another began to point out the differences in what the jumpers
were saying about their experiences. And those jumpers left off
talking to their groups, and began to shout at each other with
great vehemence, each proclaiming the rightness of their own experience
and the falsehood of the others'. 
<p>
Suddenly they drew swords and began
to hack at each other. Their followers did likewise, and soon
a general melee surrounded the whirlwind. And in the middle stood
Eblis, unmoving, and laughed within himself.
<p>
The image faded out.
<p>
Said the Voice: &quot;Thus is the balanced
triad of the divine become the false duality. And the ignorant
do not see it. They take the blurred images of the interacting
opposites, and make of them a false crown, taking a figure of
their own minds for the real thing. And the consequence of this
is eternal discord. 
<p>
&quot;Seek not Truth in God, o men.
For truth is a function of the mind, and god is not in the mind.
In God there is no truth; the divine is beyond truth or falsity,
beyond knowledge. The which is known is always a lie, and belief
always a delusion.
<p>
&quot;And so it goes. We are done.&quot;
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
Saxtomp is the first of the Parts in
sequence to be derived from the Tablet of Fire. Its zodiacal king,
Gebabal, is attributed to Cancer, and this is also the first Part
to be ruled by that King. The fiery whirlwind is a good symbol
for this combination, since the symbol of Cancer is sometimes
interpreted as a whirlpool. Those with imagination might also
note that if you put the number of the Part next to the total
number of Parts, (i.e., as 1691) you again get the image of a
whirlpool, this time between two pillars.
<p>
The vision seems to be a --  &quot;peritheosis&quot;,
if I may coin a term -- of the Path of Fire in Achad's Tree, recounting
something of its ending in the sphere of Tiphereth. The power
of Kether descending through the path here anchors itself in Tiphereth
as a hidden point of power within the expansive, inclusive power
of that sephira; just as the point of Kether is at the center
of the astrological symbol for the Sun.
<p>
It is impossible to express the sense
of total abandon, of total disregard of the self, that this fiery
energy produced during the days when I was attuning myself to
it. There was an almost uncontrollable urge to immolate myself
in some act of holy destruction. It was only when I achieved a
state of perfect silent centering that it disappeared; but then
the finite self disappeared with it. The physical effect was also
interesting; I don't think there was any real physical heat involved,
but my body was certainly convinced that it had been exposed to
heat.
<p>
The &quot;Hindu discipline&quot; mentioned
at the start of Saturday's working I now recall to be an introductory
exercise of Kundalini yoga. The arms are held above the head at
45 degree angles, with the thumbs extended straight up. Then the
engages in deep rapid breaths for a couple of minutes. This produces
a sensation of energy descending the arms to strike the heart.
Then the arms are raised further until the thumbs touch, and a
similar flow of energy comes directly down the spinal column.
Note the similarity between this and the descent of divine power
from the Supernals through the paths of Fire, Sol, and Capricorn
as mentioned later.
<p>
Eblis is the Islamic Satan; when God
commanded the angels to worship Adam, Eblis said &quot;Me thou
hast created of smokeless Fire, and shall I reverence a creature
made of dust?&quot; Thus he has a fitting connection with this
path. In the current context, one might think of him as the hindmost
portion of God. 
<p>
I cannot seem to form a coherent comment
about the remainder of the vision at the moment, though its implications
are fairly obvious.

<a NAME="Vavaamp">Vavaamp, 17th of 91
Parts, 2nd of MAZ. Zodiacal King: Arfaolg  Ministers: 9200  Mundane
association: Cyprus.</a>
<p>
Wednesday, November 02, 1994  2:21 PM
<p>
The vision opened, and I was looking
at Cyprus from the east and above. The sigil of the Parts was
overlaid upon it; beginning at the southwestern corner, moving
north a ways, then inland. The first acute angle corresponds with
the top of Mt. Olympus. Then jogging north west again, then east
along the central plain, roughly along the line between the Greek
and Turkish zones.
<p>
The picture changed, and now it seemed
I was looking at the River Styx. Beyond it was a dark land under
the shadow of thick clouds. But in the far distance at stage right
(southwest, from my new vantage) the mountain of the gods shone
in the sun. A road led in that direction.
<p>
Charon was not to be seen, but I crossed
over anyway. The land was much like some of the Tarot cards for
Death; bodies ill-buried all around, pieces of them sticking up
through the surface. A giant trash-heap or compost pile. 
<p>
Next Charon appeared with a load of
the dead. These exited his boat listlessly, heads downcast. They
all wore pale, flesh-colored robes, while their skin was the color
of raw meat; I got the impression that the robes were their skin,
already sloughing off in the process of decomposition. As they
followed the road into the deadlands, they began to sink individually
into the ground without disturbing it. The road shifted its position
so that they were distributed rather evenly over a wide area before
they were all below the surface.  
<p>
I could see into the ground, and saw
they continued to walk forward. As they did, globs and chunks
of their flesh came off, like bits of soil broken off a clod,
and were left embedded in the soil. A ghostly outline of their
form remained where the flesh had parted, an abstract sketch of
what they once were.
<p>
(This all seems almost like a precursor
to the vision of Nocamal that was previously obtained.)
<p>
A stately music begins to sound in the
background. Like one of the slower movements of a Bach concerto,
or a processional by Handel. But with a lot more basso than either
of them would give it. Something very --- &quot;architectural&quot;
about it.
<p>
For a few moments I became one of the
dead. As the flesh sloughed away and the outline was exposed,
that outline became enwrapped in royal robes. Rich, ermine-trimmed,
heavily-embroidered clothes, curly wigs underneath coronets. And
the figures swelled up with power, not the kingly power of Sol,
but the more generic &quot;nobility&quot; of Jove.
<p>
(I am getting confused. From the presence
of the mountain, I thought this vision was dealing with the intersection
between Scorpio and Capricorn. But this part seems to relate more
to Scorpio as it connects Geburah and Chesed.)
<p>
Now these figures began to arise from
the ground, all them royally dressed. They looked among themselves
in mutual recognition, as if to say &quot;We are the Elect&quot;.
Servient beings came, and escorted them to a castle -- no, a palace;
it had no defensive use. And within the palace was lavishly appointed;
refined music played in the background, artful tableaux were staged
in the larger rooms. Libraries sufficient to delight the scholarly,
kitchens producing delicacies for the Epicurean, drawing rooms
full of art, versatile baths, endless other possibilities. The
figures moved among these delights, sampling them, speaking to
one another. But all these things, while magnificent, were as
ghostly as the people who used them.
<p>
Then I noted that not one of the rooms
had windows facing the mountain. Even the extensive gardens had
walls high enough to block that view. And the one place that the
residents avoided was the single door that exited in that direction.
Even though not seen the mountain seemed to loom over them, exerting
a subtle pressure that they unconsciously avoided.
<p>
After a while, one resident among them
began to notice the door towards the mountain. He spoke about
it, and suddenly found his cohabitants uneasy, avoiding him. Conversations
would stop when he entered a room, then go on in more hushed tones.
 They didn't actively exclude him, but a subtle sense of distance
grew up between him and his fellows. 
<p>
Finally he opened the door and looked
out towards the mountain. Daily he did so, and began to compare
the wide spaces outside to the narrow rooms and corridors of the
palace. A sense of constriction began to set in; he spent more
and more of his time looking out the door.
<p>
Finally he decided to go through it,
and could not. A guard appeared and demanded that he shed his
noble robes, wig, and crown. He did so. The guard demanded he
remove his underclothes as well. And when he was completely naked
again, he was allowed to pass.
<p>
Looking around outside, he found he
was in a wasteland, its border demarcated as an extension of the
wall of the palace. He could see death's compost-heap on the other
side of that line, but none of it spilled over; the land here
was dry ground, covered by sparse dry grass. The road to the mountain
was off to one side of the palace, and he headed for it. Reaching
it, he moved onwards, alone.
<p>
(I stopped at this point to rest. The
tension of maintaining the vision was getting to me.)
<p>
Seer's comments:
<p>
A nice little allegory. The atmosphere
of the vision reminded me of <i>Piers Plowman</i>, though the
content bears no relation. And like all good allegories, the explanation
is liable to be longer than the story itself.
<p>
Once again we see the Path of Scorpio
in Achad's Tree, and in much the way it was seen in the Parts
Pothnir and Nocamal. The palace seen here may well be the same
one seen briefly at the end of Pothnir, a representation of Scorpio's
intersection with the path of Capricorn, which connects Tiphereth
and Binah. Certainly the plain of Death is the same place seen
at the start of Nocamal. But the body of the vision is more concerned
with the movement from Geburah to Chesed, along the path of Scorpio
rather than across it.
<p>
Scorpio is primarily concerned with
the concentration or distillation of a life-essence from things
in which it is hidden. In the cycle of the year, it represents
the concentration of the life of a plant into its seeds, with
the consequent death and decomposition of the plant's body.  Through
its modern ruler, Pluto, it connects with the principle of refinement
through heat and pressure, in the way that concentrations of pure
elements are precipitated out of the magma of the Earth's mantle,
and formed into jewels or crystals by the pressure there. Both
of these bear on the process seen in the vision.
<p>
Chesed, the sphere of Jupiter, represents
the essential pattern behind the manifestation of a thing in the
finite worlds. It is the archetype of which the eventual physical
manifestation is an instantiation. But it should be stressed that
these are not archetypes in the Platonic sense. Each manifest
thing has its own, individual Chesed-aspect; there is no super-archetype
of which all things of a certain class are manifestations. 
<p>
As an example, every tree in the world
has its individual &quot;essence-pattern&quot; in Chesed, but
there is no pattern representing the essence of all the worlds
trees in itself. Such seeming super-archetypes appear only as
the result of human (or other sapient) minds creating them through
their associative functions; the relationship between such creations
and the manifestations on which they were based is extremely variable.
In the natural structure of the world, the individual archetypes
of things instead resonate with each other according to the similarities
of the energies of which they are composed, forming a complex
centerless network of inter-communications. 
<p>
In the Golden Dawn-descended traditions,
the task of the adept in Geburah is to gain practical experience
at magick, learning to invoke specific magickal energies, perceive
their nature, and manipulate them. He is expected to gain a wide
experience of these powers, and the various ways in which they
can manifest themselves. This exposure to magickal powers serves
a hidden purpose as the occult equivalent of the heat and pressure
within the Earth; and by this heat, the person's essence, their
individual archetype, is gradually separated from the bodies of
manifestation in which it has been concealed. 
<p>
The magician gradually becomes aware
of the magickal energies that are the hidden cause of his own
manifest behaviors. Every thought, perception, and action begins
to reveal its magickal essence, and as he progresses along the
path of Scorpio towards Chesed, individual manifestations become
perceived as particularizations of abstract categories of magickal
power. The conscious begins to identify more with the abstract
power than with the individual actions, producing a sense of separation
between the individual self-in-essence and the variegated actions
of manifest life. 
<p>
Eventually the person reaches a point
where all the actions, thoughts, and perceptions of his manifest
life have been reduced to their least terms, as a set of abstract,
&quot;pure&quot; magickal powers, and a set of fixed relationships
or interactions between those powers. The consciousness becomes
almost wholly identified with this essential pattern, and the
person becomes an Exempt Adept in Chesed. A parallel process occurs
with respect to his perceptions of the rest of the magickal universe,
with the consequent result that his knowledge of that universe
becomes almost fully integrated into a few &quot;archetypal&quot;
patterns of powers and relationships. 
<p>
This integration of self and of knowledge
is the highest positive achievement possible within the bounds
of the Ruach. At no time before or after does the person have
as great an understanding of his individuality, or as great a
capacity for interpreting and explaining events. As Crowley points
out, such people often become leaders of &quot;schools of thought&quot;.
They become the &quot;nobility&quot; among the thinkers of the
world. The body of the vision is a visual parable of the process
I describe here.
<p>
But as Exempt Adepts are the most knowledgeable
of men, they are also the most blind; and it is the same process
by which they achieve their success that they are blinded. 
<p>
In cognitive terms, the process of refinement,
of extracting &quot;essences&quot;, by which the adepts work is
a process of abstraction. That is, of selecting a small amount
of information out of the total available according to some criteria,
and discarding the rest. Repeated abstractions inevitably produce
a hierarchical thought-structure, with each higher level being
more inclusive but less detailed than preceding levels. 
<p>
Hierarchic thinking reflects the structure
of the human mind. In fact, the process of initiation from Yesod
through Chesed is primarily a process of becoming consciously
aware of the various innate levels of the mind's structure, and
serially re-organizing the contents of the mind to suit each level's
nature. 
<p>
But the universe is not so simply organized;
in fact, entities at any particular level of existence are constantly
interacting with, influencing and being influenced by, entities
at all other levels. There is no hierarchy, but instead an amazing
network of information flows and resonances, in which entities
at any level can produce significant influences on events. Most
of this activity is lost to consciousness in the discovery of
essences and archetypes; it is &quot;filtered out&quot; before
it reaches the conscious self. Thus in the vision the Exempt Adepts
and the essential world in which their awareness is focused are
pale ghosts.
<p>
Nevertheless, these unincorporated aspects
of existence are continuously influencing the person despite his
general lack of awareness. Eventually enough incidents of &quot;things
that don't fit&quot; accumulate that the E.A. has to admit the
inadequacy of his model of the universe. This in turn leads to
realization by the Ruach of its own innate limitations and restrictions.
(In the vision, the model, the perceived essences, are the kingly
clothes; the Ruach is represented by the underclothes. ) Before
the person can move on, he has to abandon reliance upon both,
and become once more a small naked being in a big universe. When
this is done, he becomes a &quot;Babe of the Abyss&quot;.<br>
