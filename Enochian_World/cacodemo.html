<P>
The enochian system is primarily angelic in character. There are
no entities in the system who actually meet the traditional definitions
of elementals or demons. All the elemental forces are invoked
and used through the intervention of conscious, intelligent entities
who are themselves of a multiplex nature. These entities can provide
elementals for the magician, but the elementals can not be directly
invoked.
<P>
The closest one can come to directly invoking an elemental in
this system is in the invocation of the so-called &quot;cacodemons&quot;
(Dee's appellation) or &quot;minimal sapient entities&quot; (my
appellation). I use this name for them because they are the least
complicated beings in the system that are capable of responding
to their environment and maintaining an independent existence.
They are composed of two forces of opposite polarity, bound together
by one additional letter from the Tablet of Union. Thus they have
one force for each of the three necessary aspects, sulphur, salt,
and mercury.
<P>
The following excerpt provides a description of the process of
invoking these cacodemons in the Temple. It was provided in an
astral contact with Atapa, Sephirotic Angel of the Fiery Lesser
Angle of the Water Tablet.1
<P>
These instructions should not be interpreted rigidly. There are
numerous minor variations, particularly in the method of forming
the names. The flexibility of the Enochian system is such that
all of them will produce results, varying slightly with the method
used.
<P>
&quot;The threads of my garment are of course the so-called &quot;cacodemons&quot;
of the sub-angle, made out of the forces of the kerubic and servient
squares. They seem at times to be demons, but only when their
force is allowed to manifest unconstrained. Like animals in your
own world, they are full of emotion, but do not have any sense.
Therefore, we higher types such as myself and the other angels
of the crosses must be strong gods to them, leading them both
gently and firmly, as one would lead a loyal but temperamental
dog.
<P>
&quot;In your work with these demons, do not be afraid to treat
them roughly, for it is all that they understand, until you have
trained them in a new way.
<P>
&quot;Now when Dee made the tablets to appear in the world, he
said that only the first two letters of the kerubic and servient
names could be made into cacodemons. But in truth, the angelic
[kerubic] squares and servient squares can all be used in such
demons, provided that the square is united with one which is right
next to it in the temple of the tablet. Thus, there are four possible
cacodemons in every kerubic angels's domain, since in the pillars
there are four pairs of squares that share an edge. [Similarly
for the rows making up the altars -- B.R.]
<P>
&quot;Now, in the invocation of the cacodemons, ye must form their
names in one of two ways. The first only may ye use for the cacodemons
of the Kerubic squares. This first or the second may be used with
the squares of the servants.
<P>
&quot;For all the squares, ye may take any two letters whose squares
have a connecting edge in the pillar or the altar. Take ye not
the diagonal forces, for they are of the same polarity, and would
not be well balanced. (Thus also for letters from different rows
of the altar.) Prefix these with the letter of spirit from the
element's line in the Tablet of Union, and thus ye have the names
of the cacodemons.
<P>
&quot;For example, in my own quarter, the Kerubic squares are
NLRX. This would give cacodemons HNL, HLR, HRX,HXN. The letter
from the tablet of union always represents the balanced spirit
in the entity. The second and third letters are male or female
according to the polarity of their sub-energy in its attribution
to IHVH. In HNL, N is (Earth of (Fire of Water)), and is thus
female. L is (Air of (Fire of Water)), and thus male. So also
for any Kerubic cacodemon.2
<P>
&quot;In the servient squares, the female- or male-ness of a square
is according to the kerubic letter governing its column position.

<P>
&quot;In forming the names of the cacodemons of the servient squares,
a second method can be used. This is to take the letter from the
element's name in the Tablet of Union that is attributed to the
element governing the row from which the names are being derived.
Thus, the top servient row in my quarter, attributed to fire,
would form the names thus: AXP, APC, ACN, ANX. Or, using the letter
of Spirit: HXP, HPC, HCN, HNX.3
<P>
&quot;The latter form is better for works of a spiritual or internal
nature. The former are better for works intended to manifest in
the outside world. A letter from the Tablet of Union must be used
in every demon's name. For the forces of the two squares from
the Elemental Tablet will not hold together without the light
of this third. There is no harm in trying, but the forces will
instantly dissipate again when the magician relaxes his will.
<P>
&quot;Also, the second and third letters may be switched in their
places, to emphasize one or the other of the demon's forces.
<P>
&quot;Now, when invoking a cacodemon in the Temple built from
the Tablet, stand in the center of the Temple, where the light
of the Solar King of the Tablet comes down in a beam of radiance
from above. Face the altar that contains the letters of the demon
in question.4 Perform the invocation of Spirit using the first
key, and not the second key. Invoke the elemental name from the
Tablet of Union. Call upon that god to fill your temple with radiance.
Also state the purpose of your invocation at this point, in a
short form.
<P>
&quot;Next, recite the call of the Element, and invoke the Holy
Names of the tablet down through the level of the Seniors. Then
recite the calls of the sub-element, whether or not this be the
same as the call of the Element of the Working. Then invoke the
names of the gods and angels of the sub- element. For the kerubic
names, add the letter from the Tablet of Union, if the work be
one of raising oneself in the spirit, or bringing down the spirit.
Use no additional letter if the work be one of expression in the
levels of matter.
<P>
&quot;Then invoke the angel governing the line within which the
demon lives, using a letter from the tablet of union or not, along
the same rule as the kerubic squares. Finally, invoke the cacodemon
itself.
<P>
&quot;Its visible appearance, whether manifest in the temple or
only in the vision, should reflect the attributions of the squares
from which it is formed. The first letter will determine the form
of the head. The second will determine the form of the arms and
upper torso, and the third letter will determine the lower torso
and legs. Thus some truly odd looking entities can be seen in
this process.
<P>
&quot;For works of an internal nature, to strengthen or counter
some aspect of the personality, a glyph or visual symbol embodying
the desired outcome should be prepared ahead of time in the imagination,
and rehearsed until it can be held in the mind with ease.
<P>
&quot;When the demon is evoked to visible appearance in the astral
temple, he appears above the altar from which his forces come.
Often one of the strands of the light-fountain will straighten
and he will appear out of it. He is bound to the altar both by
his own origins, and by the light of the central square of the
Sephirotic cross of the quarter, which is directly above his head.
He may not leave this place without permission, nor may he cause
any harm to the magician while so bound.
<P>
&quot;If the magician wishes to direct the demon to the aid of
his work, he will present the symbols of the work to the demon,
and state his will clearly. Then he should charge the demon to
put his force into the symbol of the work, and to cause that work
to be accomplished through the forces he represents.
<P>
&quot;Be advised that the demons may do their work in a manner
that is offensive to &quot;community standards of conduct&quot;.
The magician should not allow himself to become emotionally involved
through such offense. He must always consider himself to be superior
to such creatures, and consider that it is doing his will within
the limits of its abilities.
<P>
&quot;For example, a cacodemon might choose to transfer his three
aspects to the symbol of the work by spitting on it, then copulating
with it, then defecating on it. Think not that it intends any
disrespect by this. It barely has enough intelligence to be conscious,
and there is none left over for cleverness. Think of it thus,
as a particularly stupid animal, which must be dealt with firmly,
but without trying to change its instinctive nature.
<P>
&quot;No such creature has secrets of any importance. They are
merely bundles of elemental forces. If they speak, the great likelihood
is that they echo the unconscious will of the magician, and speak
not of their own will (of which they have none).
<P>
&quot;For a working intended to be effective outside of the person,
in the manifest world, a physical talisman should be made. These
can be out of papyrus, or compressed and smoothed sheepskin, or
out of cedar or other wood. If made out of wood, its height should
be one-quarter its diameter.
<P>
&quot;The talisman should show on its back side the enochian sigil
of the Element of the Working in the center, surrounded by four
sigils showing the sub-elements of the tablet, with the sub-element
of the working at the top. And all bound together by a circle
around the rim of the talisman.
<P>
&quot;On the front side should be written in Enochian or English
characters the names of all the gods and angels of the hierarchy
above the cacodemon.5 The name of the Elemental God and King should
be centered, with the names of the seniors placed around the rim.
The names of the Calvary Cross of the sub-element should be placed
above the names of God and King, and formed into their cross.
The names of the Kerubic angel, lesser angel, and cacodemon should
be placed below the King-name. The symbol of the working should
be placed to the left of the name of the cacodemon, or directly
above it, since we are shaping him to do the work. [The Three
Names and the King's name should be written twice as large as
the other names. -- B.R.]
<P>
&quot;When the demon is evoked for outward purpose, and comes
to visible appearance within the temple, then the talisman is
raised in the physical hands, while its astral counterpart is
raised and placed on the altar from which the demon comes. The
magician initiates a vortex around the edge of the talisman, and
charges the demon to become one with the vortex and follow it
down into the talisman. If necessary, the force of the Sephirotic
cross can be brought down from its place in the ceiling to force
the demon into the talisman. When the demon does this and the
vortex is absorbed into the talisman, then a gesture of sealing
should be done over it, binding the demon inside it until released.
Cover the physical talisman with a white cloth to protect it from
dust, but leave it out in the parts of your home or workplace
you use in your daily life, so that it may connect itself to the
threads which are the means by which the work will be  ccomplished.&quot;

<P>
1       &quot;Atapa&quot; is actually a name of God for the Lesser
Angle. A section preceding the part quoted here showed that the
angel who was speaking considered himself to be a small portion
of the god's force, hence his use of the name. His validity was
established by other means than gematria.
<P>
2       This paragraph follows MacGregor Mather's attributes for
the squares, which I was using at the time. Dee's records and
my own later, incomplete research indicate that while the squares
do alternate in polarity, the attributes to the elements do not
follow Mather's system in most cases. Magicians should not feel
bound to follow Mathers if results show another way to be more
effective for themselves.
<P>
3       Dee's rituals suggest an alternative, which is to attribute
each servient row from top to bottom to successive letters of
the Tablet of Union name. In this alternate system, the Union
letter for the top servient row would be &quot;C&quot;, second
row &quot;O&quot;, third row &quot;M&quot;, fourth row &quot;A&quot;.
<P>
4       If two magicians are working together, the second should
stand with his back to the pillar of the sub-element, facing the
light in the center. Up to three additional magicians can stand
at the other pillars. The magician in the center identifies himself
with the Elemental King. Any others should identify themselves
with the Kerubic Archangels.
<P>
5       Either of the two hierarchies mentioned earlier can be
used. I find that the second gives a more &quot;elemental&quot;
effect.<HR>
