<H2><A NAME="WhatIsChakra"></A>What is a Chakra?</H2>
<P>The word <I>chakra</I> is a Sanskrit word which is derived from the verb <I>car</I> 
  (&quot;to move&quot;). There are several literal meanings of chakra:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>wheel</LI>
  <LI>circle</LI>
  <LI>center</LI>
</UL>
<P>Besides the literal meaning there are also some esoteric meanings: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>The Chakra denotes the &quot;wheel of becoming&quot; (<I>bhavacakra</I>), 
    or &quot;round of existence&quot; (<I>samsara</I>), which is the phenomenal 
    cosmos. </LI>
  <LI>The word Chakra is used to refer to a circle of initiates in a Tantric ritual. 
  </LI>
  <LI>A Chakra is a diagram used to determine the right kind of mantra for a particular 
    situation or student. </LI>
  <LI>The word Chakra refers to the psychoenergetic vortices forming the major 
    &quot;organs&quot; of the body composed of life energy (<I>prana</I>). These 
    esoteric structures are also often referred to and graphically depicted as 
    &quot;lotuses&quot; (<I>padma</I>, <I>kamala</I>). </LI>
</UL>
<P>&quot;There are seven basic vibratory rates (bodies) which we use to progress 
  from very basic energies to the very highly developed superhuman levels.&quot; 
  Paulson, <I>Kundalini and the Chakras</I>, pg. 35.</P>
<P>Vyasa comments that during single-pointed meditation, which is fixation on 
  a single point (<I>desabandhascittasya dharana</I>), that the concentration 
  is usually on the center, or <I>chakra</I>, of the navel, on the lotus of the 
  heart, on the light within the head, on the tip of the nose, on the tip of the 
  tongue, or on any external place or object.</P>
<P>In the Rg-Veda and the Upanishads there is an identification of the body and 
  the cosmos. Eliade [Ref: Eliade, Yoga, pg. 117] called these identifications 
  micro-macrocosmic homologies. He mentions three:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>the cosmic winds will be &quot;mastered&quot; as breaths</LI>
  <LI>the cosmic <I>skambha</I>-pillar will be identified with the vertebral column</LI>
  <LI>the &quot;center of the world&quot; will be found in a point (the &quot;heart&quot;) 
    or an axis (traversing the <I>chakras</I> inside the body.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Within the Bodhi Reference Model we use the terminology <A HREF="bodymetaphor.htm">Body 
  Metaphors</A> for micro-macrocosmic homologies although we will mean, essentially, 
  the same thing.</P>
<P>Consider some of the language used to describe the Chakras:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>as a <I>flower</I></LI>
  <LI>as a <I>whirling vortex</I> of living energy</LI>
  <LI>as a <I>point object</I> emitting vibratory energy</LI>
  <LI>as a <I>pulsation</I> in the human energy field</LI>
  <LI>as <I>nerve complexes</I> or ganglia</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ShortDescriptionOfChakras"></A>A Short Description of the Seven Chakras</H2>
<P>There seven major chakras, or centers of psychoactive energy, in the human 
  body. They are usually listed either top-down or bottom-up depending upon the 
  secret agenda of the writer. The fact that the seven chakras are aligned along 
  an axis running vertically through the body provides a natural geometry on the 
  chakras. Here they are listed top-down.</P>

  <HR WIDTH="100%">
  <A NAME="TheSahasrara"></A>The Sahasrara</H2>
<P>This is the topmost center chakra. It is two to three inches over the top of 
  the head. It is also called the thousand-spoked wheel, the thousand-petaled 
  lotus (<I>sahasra-dala-padma</I>), the great seat (<I>maha-pitha</I>), or ether 
  wheel (<I>akasha-cakra</I>).</P>
<P>The <I>Kaula-Jnana-Nirnaya</I> (V.8) describes it as a white lotus floating 
  in the middle of the &quot;milk ocean&quot; in whose center resides the Self.</P>
<P>The Shiva-Samhita gives three different locations for it:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>the root of the palate (<I>talu</I>)</LI>
  <LI>the &quot;brahmic fissure&quot; (<I>brhma-randhra</I>)</LI>
  <LI>outside the body, above the head</LI>
</OL>
<P>The third location is the one most generally accepted by modern yogins.</P>
<P>*It is the upper terminal point of the central channel (<I>sushumna-nadi</I>) 
  and the final destination for the awakened serpent-power (<I>kundalini-shakti</I>). 
  When the kundalini, the force of Devi, reaches this center, this signals the 
  merging of Shiva and Shakti.</P>
<P>*The thousand spoke or petals of this bell-shaped psychospiritual center are 
  arranged in twenty layers, with fifty petals each. Each petal has one letter 
  (<I>matrika</I>) of the Sanskrit alphabet inscribed in it forming a ring, which 
  is known as &quot;five-crested garland&quot; (<I>panca-shikha-mala</I>). In 
  the pericarp of the lotus is the &quot;lunar region&quot; (<I>candra-mandala</I>), 
  which emits nectarine light. It contains a luminous triangle within which is 
  the void (<I>shunya</I>), also called &quot;supreme seed point&quot; (<I>parama-bindu</I>), 
  the abode of transcendental Consciousness-Bliss.</P>
<H2> 
  <HR WIDTH="100%">
  <A NAME="TheAjna"></A>The Ajna</H2>
<P>This is the Third-eye chakra and is located in the middle of the head at the 
  level of the eyebrows. The name &quot;third eye&quot; is derived from the Guru 
  Yogas and was the receiver of the telepathic communications which the chela 
  received. Hence, the ajna-chakra is also called the guru-chakra. But a guru 
  is also a word meaning dispeller of light, so that an alternate derivation might 
  have been from the darkness-destroying aspects of the ajna-chakra.</P>
<P>The presiding dieties of the ajna-chakra are Parama-Shiva and the Goddess Hakini.</P>
<P>The activation of the chakra by rising Kundalini-Shakti is said to lead to 
  psychic powers called siddhi, including clairvoyance and telepathic communication.</P>
<H2> 
  <HR WIDTH="100%">
  <A NAME="TheVishuddha"></A>The Vishuddha</H2>
<P>This center is also known as <I>jalandhara-pitha</I> and &quot;great doorway 
  to liberation&quot; (<I>maha-moksha-dvara</I>). It is located in the throat 
  well (kantha-kupa). See the Yoga-Shikha-Upanishad (I.174).</P>
<P>According to the <I>Shat-Cakra-Nirupana</I>, its pericarp is composed of the 
  &quot;circle of space&quot; (<I>nabho-mandala</I>), which resembles the full 
  moon. The center has a seed syllable of ham, associated with the element ether 
  (akasha).</P>
<P>The deity for this center is the Goddess Shakini.</P>
<P>The Shiva Samhita (V.92) states that by contemplating this chakra, one acquires 
  an instant comprehension of the Vedas and all their mysteries.</P>
<H2> 
  <HR WIDTH="100%">
  <A NAME="TheAnahata"></A>The Anahata</H2>
<P>*This is the Heart Chakra which is also known as the &quot;lotus of the heart&quot; 
  (<I>hrit-padma</I>), and is recognized as a special locus of the sacred since 
  the time of the Vedas. The heart has always been venerated as the seat of the 
  Divine and as the location from whence came the immortal sound <I>om</I>, which 
  is not produced by anything, can be heard.</P>
<P>The anahata's presiding adept is Pinakin, the presiding Goddess is the yellow-colored, 
  three-eyed Kakini. The heart center is likened to the legendary wish-fulfilling 
  tree. It is the abode of the &quot;swan&quot; (hamsa). Activation of this chakra 
  by rising Kundalini-Shakti is said to lead to the siddhis of immeasurable knowledge, 
  clairaudience, and clairvoyance.</P>
<H2> 
  <HR WIDTH="100%">
  <A NAME="TheManipura"></A>The Manipura</H2>
<P>According to the <I>Shat-Cakra-Nirupana</I> there is a triangular &quot;region&quot; 
  (mandala) of fire within this chakra.</P>
<P>The center's presiding adept is Rudra, the presiding Goddess is the four-armed, 
  dark-hued Lakini. The &quot;seed syllable&quot; (<I>bija-mantra</I>) is ram, 
  which pertains to the fire element.</P>
<P>According to the Shiva Samhita (V.81), the yogin who contemplates this esoteric 
  structure not only conquers disease and death but also acquires the ability 
  to enter another body, as well as to make gold, discover medicial remedies, 
  and locate hidden treasures.</P>
<P>According to the Shandilya-Upanishad (I.4.6), it is inthe Manipura that the 
  psyche (<I>jiva</I>) resides like a spider in its web.</P>
<H2> 
  <HR WIDTH="100%">
  <A NAME="TheSvadhisththana"></A>The Svadhisththana</H2>
<P>This chakra has the seed syllable vam, pertaining to the water (<I>ap</I>) 
  element.</P>
<P>This center's presiding deities are Vishnu and the Goddess Rakini.</P>
<P>The center is associated iwht the sense of taste (rasa), the hands, and fertility 
  symbolized by the image of an aquatic monster resemblin a crocodile.</P>
<P>This center contains an &quot;inward-facing&quot; phallus (linga) shining like 
  coral.</P>
<P>Through contemplation of this center, the yogin becomes attractive to the world, 
  especially to the other sex.</P>
<H2> 
  <HR WIDTH="100%">
  <A NAME="TheMuladhara"></A>The Muladhara</H2>
<P>The lowest of the seven principal psychoenergetic centers (chakras) of the 
  body.</P>
<P>Its seed syllable is lam, which pertains to the earth element.</P>
<P>The center's presiding adept is Dviranda, and its presiding Goddess is Dakini. 
  This center contains the radiant triangle called <I>kama-rupa</I> (&quot;desire 
  formed&quot;) within which is found the golden phallus (<I>linga</I>) of Shiva. 
  This chakra is the source of the central channel (sushumna-nadi) of the life-force, 
  and the resting place of the serpent-power (kundalini-shakti).</P>
<P>Regual contemplation of this chakra yields the paranormal ability to jump like 
  a frog and, in advanced stages, to actually levitate.</P>
