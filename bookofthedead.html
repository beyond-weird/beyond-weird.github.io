THE PAPYRUS OF ANI<br>
(THE EGYPTIAN BOOK OF THE DEAD)<br>
Translated by E.A. Wallis Budge
<p><br>
  HYMN TO OSIRIS</p>
<p>&quot;Homage to thee, Osiris, Lord of eternity, King of the Gods, whose<br>
  names are manifold, whose forms are holy, thou being of hidden form in<br>
  the temples, whose Ka is holy. Thou art the governor of Tattu<br>
  (Busiris), and also the mighty one in Sekhem (Letopolis). Thou art the<br>
  Lord to whom praises are ascribed in the nome of Ati, thou art the<br>
  Prince of divine food in Anu. Thou art the Lord who is commemorated in<br>
  Maati, the Hidden Soul, the Lord of Qerrt (Elephantine), the Ruler<br>
  supreme in White Wall (Memphis). Thou art the Soul of Ra, his own<br>
  body, and hast thy place of rest in Henensu (Herakleopolis). Thou<br>
  art the beneficent one, and art praised in Nart. Thou makest thy<br>
  soul to be raised up. Thou art the Lord of the Great House in<br>
  Khemenu (Hermopolis). Thou art the mighty one of victories in<br>
  Shas-hetep, the Lord of eternity, the Governor of Abydos. The path<br>
  of his throne is in Ta-tcheser (a part of Abydos). Thy name is<br>
  established in the mouths of men. Thou art the substance of Two<br>
  Lands (Egypt). Thou art Tem, the feeder of Kau (Doubles), the Governor<br>
  of the Companies of the gods. Thou art the beneficent Spirit among the<br>
  spirits. The god of the Celestial Ocean (Nu) draweth from thee his<br>
  waters. Thou sendest forth the north wind at eventide, and breath from<br>
  thy nostrils to the satisfaction of thy heart. Thy heart reneweth<br>
  its youth, thou producest the.... The stars in the celestial heights<br>
  are obedient unto thee, and the great doors of the sky open themselves<br>
  before thee. Thou art he to whom praises are ascribed in the<br>
  southern heaven, and thanks are given for thee in the northern heaven.<br>
  The imperishable stars are under thy supervision, and the stars<br>
  which never set are thy thrones. Offerings appear before thee at the<br>
  decree of Keb. The Companies of the Gods praise thee, and the gods<br>
  of the Tuat (Other World) smell the earth in paying homage to thee.<br>
  The uttermost parts of the earth bow before thee, and the limits of<br>
  the skies entreat thee with supplications when they see thee. The holy<br>
  ones are overcome before thee, and all Egypt offereth thanksgiving<br>
  unto thee when it meeteth Thy Majesty. Thou art a shining Spirit-Body,<br>
  the governor of Spirit-Bodies; permanent is thy rank, established is<br>
  thy rule. Thou art the well-doing Sekhem (Power) of the Company of the<br>
  Gods, gracious is thy face, and beloved by him that seeth it. Thy fear<br>
  is set in all the lands by reason of thy perfect love, and they cry<br>
  out to thy name making it the first of names, and all people make<br>
  offerings to thee. Thou art the lord who art commemorated in heaven<br>
  and upon earth. Many are the cries which are made to thee at the Uak<br>
  festival, and with one heart and voice Egypt raiseth cries of joy to<br>
  thee.<br>
  &quot;Thou art the Great Chief, the first among thy brethren, the<br>
  Prince of the Company of the Gods, the stablisher of Right and Truth<br>
  throughout the World, the Son who was set on the great throne of his<br>
  father Keb. Thou art the beloved of thy mother Nut, the mighty one<br>
  of valour, who overthrew the Sebau-fiend. Thou didst stand up and<br>
  smite thine enemy, and set thy fear in thine adversary. Thou dost<br>
  bring the boundaries of the mountains. Thy heart is fixed, thy legs<br>
  are set firm. Thou art the heir of Keb and of the sovereignty of the<br>
  Two Lands (Egypt). He (Keb) hath seen his splendours, he hath<br>
  decreed for him the guidance of the world by thy hand as long as times<br>
  endure. Thou hast made this earth with thy hand, and the waters, and<br>
  the winds, and the vegetation, and all the cattle, and all the<br>
  feathered fowl, and all the fish, and all the creeping things, and all<br>
  the wild animals therof. The desert is the lawful possession of the<br>
  son of Nut. The Two Lands (Egypt) are content to crown thee upon the<br>
  throne of thy father, like Ra.<br>
  &quot;Thou rollest up into the horizon, thou hast set light over the<br>
  darkness, thou sendest forth air from thy plumes, and thou floodest<br>
  the Two Lands like the Disk at daybreak. Thy crown penetrateth the<br>
  height of heaven, thou art the companion of the stars, and the guide<br>
  of every god. Thou art beneficent in decree and speech, the favoured<br>
  one of the Great Company of the Gods, and the beloved of the Little<br>
  Company of the Gods.<br>
  His sister [Isis] hath protected him, and hath repulsed the<br>
  fiends, and turned aside calamities (of evil). She uttered the spell<br>
  with the magical power of her mouth. Her tongue was perfect, and it<br>
  never halted at a word. Beneficent in command and word was Isis, the<br>
  woman of magical spells, the advocate of her brother. She sought him<br>
  untiringly, she wandered round and round about this earth in sorrow,<br>
  and she alighted not without finding him. She made light with her<br>
  feathers, she created air with her wings, and she uttered the death<br>
  wail for her brother. She raised up the inactive members of whose<br>
  heart was still, she drew from him his essence, she made an heir,<br>
  she reared the child in loneliness, and the place where he was not<br>
  known, and he grew in strength and stature, and his hand was mighty in<br>
  the House of Keb. The Company of the Gods rejoiced, rejoiced, at the<br>
  coming of Horus, the son of Osiris, whose heart was firm, the<br>
  triumphant, the son of Isis, the heir of Osiris.&quot;<br>

<p>A HYMN OF PRAISE TO RA WHEN HE RISETH IN THE EASTERN PART OF HEAVEN:<br>
  Behold, the Osiris Ani, the scribe of the holy offerings of all the<br>
  gods, saith: Homage to thee, O thou who hast come as Khepera,<br>
  Khepera the creator of the gods, Thou art seated on thy throne, thou<br>
  risest up in the sky, illumining thy mother [Nut], thou art seated<br>
  on thy throne as the king of the gods. [Thy] mother Nut stretcheth out<br>
  her hands, and performeth an act of homage to thee. The domain of Manu<br>
  receiveth thee with satisfaction. The goddess Maat embraceth thee at<br>
  the two seasons of the day. May Ra give glory, and power, and<br>
  thruth-speaking, and the appearance as a living soul so that he may<br>
  gaze upon Heru-khuti, to the KA of the Osiris the Scribe Ani, who<br>
  speaketh truth before Osiris, and who saith: Hail, O all ye gods of<br>
  the House of the Soul, who weigh heaven and earth in a balance, and<br>
  who give celestial food [to the dead]. Hail, Tatun, [who art] One,<br>
  thou creator of mortals [and] of the Companies of the Gods of the<br>
  South and of the North, of the West and of the East, ascribe ye praise<br>
  to Ra, the lord of heaven, the KING, Life, Strength, and Health, the<br>
  maker of the gods. Give ye thanks unto him in his beneficent form<br>
  which is enthroned in the Atett Boat; beings celestial praise thee,<br>
  beings terrestial praise thee. Thoth and the goddess Maat mark out thy<br>
  course for thee day by day and every day. Thine enemy the Serpent hath<br>
  been given over to the fire. The Serpent-fiend Sebau hath fallen<br>
  headlong, his forelegs are bound in chains, and his hind legs hath<br>
  Ra carried away from him. The Sons of Revolt shall never more rise up.<br>
  The House of the Aged One keepeth festival, and the voices of those<br>
  who make merry are in the Great Place. The gods rejoice when they<br>
  see Ra crowned upon his throne, and when his beams flood the world<br>
  with light. The majesty of this holy god setteth out on his journey,<br>
  and he goeth onwards until he reacheth the land of Manu; the earth<br>
  becometh light at his birth each day; he proceedeth until he<br>
  reacheth the place where he was yesterday. O be thou at peace with me.<br>
  Let me gaze upon thy beauties. Let me journey above the earth. Let<br>
  me smite the Ass. Let me slit asunder the Serpent-fiend Sebau. Let<br>
  me destroy Aepep at the moment of his greatest power. Let me behold<br>
  the Abtu Fish at his season, and the Ant Fish with the Ant Boat as<br>
  it piloteth it in its lake. Let me behold Horus when he is in charge<br>
  of the rudder [of the Boat of Ra], with Thoth and the goddess Maat<br>
  on each side of him. Let me lay hold of the tow-rope of the Sektet<br>
  Boat, and the rope at the stern of the Matett Boat. Let Ra grant to me<br>
  a view of the Disk (the Sun), and a sight of Ah (the Moon) unfailingly<br>
  each day. Let my Ba-soul come forth to walk about hither and thither<br>
  and whithersoever it pleaseth. Let my name be called out, let it be<br>
  found inscribed on the tablet which recordeth the names of those who<br>
  are to receive offerings. Let meals from the sepulchral offerings be<br>
  given to me in the presence [of Osiris], as to those who are in the<br>
  following of Horus. Let there be prepared for me a seat in the Boat of<br>
  the Sun on the day wheron the god saileth. Let me be received in the<br>
  presence of Osiris in the Land of Truth-speaking- the Ka of Osiris<br>
  Ani.<br>

<p>NEKHT, THE CAPTAIN OF SOLDIERS, THE ROYAL SCRIBE, SINGETH A HYMN<br>
  OF PRAISE TO RA, and saith:- Homage to thee, O thou glorious Being,<br>
  thou who art dowered [with all sovereignty]. O Tem-Heru-Khuti<br>
  (Tem-Harmakhis), when thou risest in the horizon of heaven a cry of<br>
  joy goeth forth to thee from all people. O thou beautiful Being,<br>
  thou dost renew thyself in thy season in the form of the Disk,<br>
  within thy mother Hathor. Therefore in every place every heart<br>
  swelleth with joy at thy rising for ever. The regions of the South and<br>
  the North come to thee with homage, and send forth acclamations at thy<br>
  rising on the horizon of heaven, and thou illuminest the Two Lands<br>
  with rays of turquoise-[coloured] light. O Ra, who art Heru-Khuti, the<br>
  divine man-child, the heir of eternity, self-begotten and self-born,<br>
  king of the earth, prince of the Tuat (the Other World), governor of<br>
  Aukert, thou didst come from the Water-god, thou didst spring from the<br>
  Sky-god Nu, who doth cherish thee and order thy members. O thou god of<br>
  life, thou lord of love, all men live when thou shinest; thou art<br>
  crowned king of the gods. The goddess Nut embraceth thee, and the<br>
  goddess Mut enfoldeth thee at all seasons. Those who are in thy<br>
  following sing unto thee with joy, and they bow down their foreheads<br>
  to the earth when they meet thee, the lord of heaven, the lord of<br>
  the earth, the King of Truth, the lord of eternity, the prince of<br>
  everlastingness, thou sovereign of all the gods, thou god of life,<br>
  thou creator of eternity, thou maker of heaven wherin thou art<br>
  firmly stablished.<br>
  The Company of the Gods rejoice at thy rising, the earth is glad<br>
  when it beholdeth thy rays; the people who have been long dead come<br>
  forth with cries of joy to behold thy beauties every day. Thou goest<br>
  forth each day over heaven and earth, and thou art made strong each<br>
  day be thy mother Nut. Thou passest over the heights of heaven, thy<br>
  heart swelleth with joy; and the Lake of Testes (the Great Oasis) is<br>
  content thereat. The Serpent-fiend hath fallen, his arms are hewn off,<br>
  the Knife hath severed his joints. Ra liveth by Maat (Law), the<br>
  beautiful! The Sektet Boat advanceth and cometh into port. The South<br>
  and the North, and the West and East, turn to praise thee. O thou<br>
  First, Great God (PAUTA), who didst come into being of thine own<br>
  accord, Isis and Nephthys salute thee, they sing unto thee songs of<br>
  joy at thy rising in the boat, they stretch out their hands unto thee.<br>
  The Souls of the East follow thee, and the Souls of the West praise<br>
  thee. Thou art the Ruler of all the gods. Thou in thy shrine hast joy,<br>
  for the Serpent-fiend Nak hath been judged by the fire, and thy<br>
  heart shall rejoice for ever. Thy mother Nut is esteemed by thy father<br>
  Nu.<br>
  HYMN TO OSIRIS UN-NEFER</p>
<p>A Hymn of Praise to Osiris Un-Nefer, the great god who dwelleth in<br>
  Abtu, the king of eternity, the lord of everlastingness, who<br>
  traverseth millions of years in his existence. Thou art the eldest son<br>
  of the womb of Nut. Thou was begotten by Keb, the Erpat. Thou art<br>
  the lord of the Urrt Crown. Thou art he whose White Crown is lofty.<br>
  Thou art the King (Ati) of gods [and] men. Thou hast gained possession<br>
  of the sceptre of rule, and the whip, and the rank and dignity of<br>
  thy divine fathers. Thy heart is expanded with joy, O thou who art<br>
  in the kingdom of the dead. Thy son Horus is firmly placed on thy<br>
  throne. Thou hast ascended thy throne as the Lord of Tetu, and as<br>
  the Heq who dwelleth in Abydos. Thou makest the Two Lands to<br>
  flourish through Truth-speaking, in the presence of him who is the<br>
  Lord to the Uttermost Limit. Thou drawest on that which hath not yet<br>
  come into being in thy name of &quot;Ta-her-sta-nef.&quot; Thou governest the<br>
  Two Lands by Maat in thy name of &quot;Seker.&quot; Thy power is wide-spread,<br>
  thou art he of whom the fear is great in thy name of &quot;Usar&quot; (or<br>
  &quot;Asar&quot;). Thy existence endureth for an infinite number of double henti<br>
  periods in thy name of &quot;Un-Nefer.&quot;<br>
  Homage to thee, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and Prince of<br>
  Princes. Thou hast ruled the Two Lands from the womb of the goddess<br>
  Nut. Thou hast governed the Lands of Akert. Thy members are of<br>
  silver-gold, thy head is of lapis-lazuli, and the crown of thy head is<br>
  of turquoise. Thou art An of millions of years. Thy body is all<br>
  pervading, O Beautiful Face in Ta-tchesert. Grant thou to me glory<br>
  in heaven, and power upon earth, and truth-speaking in the Divine<br>
  Underworld, and [the power to] sail down the river to Tetu in the form<br>
  of a living Ba-soul, and [the power to] sail up the river to Abydos in<br>
  the form of a Benu bird, and [the power to] pass in through and to<br>
  pass out from, without obstruction, the doors of the lords of the<br>
  Tuat. Let there be given unto me bread-cakes in the House of<br>
  Refreshing, and sepulchral offerings of cakes and ale, and<br>
  propitiatory offerings in Anu, and a permanent homestead in<br>
  Sekhet-Aaru, with wheat and barley therein- to the Double of the<br>
  Osiris, the scribe Ani.<br>

<p>The Osiris Ani, the Osiris the scribe Ani saith:- Homage to thee,<br>
  O Bull of Amentet, Thoth the king of eternity is with me. I am the<br>
  great god by the side of the divine boat, I have fought for thee, I am<br>
  one of those gods, those divine chiefs, who proved the<br>
  truth-speaking of Osiris before his enemies on the day of the weighing<br>
  of words. I am thy kinsman Osiris. I am [one of] those gods who were<br>
  the children of the goddess Nut, who hacked in pieces the enemies of<br>
  Osiris, and who bound in fetters the legion of Sebau devils on his<br>
  behalf. I am thy kinsman Horus, I have fought on thy behalf, I have<br>
  come to thee for thy name's sake. I am Thoth who proved the truth of<br>
  the words of Osiris before his enemies on the day of the weighing of<br>
  words in the great House of the Prince, who dwelleth in Anu. I am<br>
  Teti, the son of Teti. My mother conceived me in Tetu, and gave<br>
  birth to me in Tetu. I am with the mourners [and with] the women who<br>
  tear out their hair and make lament for Osiris in Taui-Rekhti, proving<br>
  true the words of Osiris before his enemies. Ra commanded Thoth to</p>
<p>prove true the words of Osiris before his enemies; what was<br>
  commanded [for Osiris], let that be done for me by Thoth. I am with<br>
  Horus on the day of dressing Teshtesh. I open the hidden water-springs<br>
  for the ablutions of Urt-ab. I unbolt the door of the Shetait Shrine<br>
  in Ra-stau. I am with Horus as the protector of the left shoulder of<br>
  Osiris, the dweller in Sekhem. I enter in among and I come forth<br>
  from the Flame-gods on the day of the destruction of the Sebau<br>
  fiends in Sekhem. I am with Horus on the day[s] of the festivals of<br>
  Osiris, at the making of offerings and oblations, namely, on the<br>
  festival which is celebrated on the sixth day of the month, and on the<br>
  day of the Tenat festival in Anu. I am the UAB priest (libationer)<br>
  in Tetu, Rera, the dweller in Per-Asar. I exalt him that is upon the<br>
  high place of the country. I look upon the hidden things (the<br>
  mysteries) in Ra-stau. I recite the words of the liturgy of the<br>
  festival of the Soul-god in Tetu. I am the SEM priest, and [perform]<br>
  his duties. I am the UR-KHERP-HEM priest on the day of placing the<br>
  Henu Boat of Seker upon its divine sledge. I have taken in my hand the<br>
  digging tool on the day of digging up the earth in Hensu.<br>
  Hail, O ye who make perfect souls to enter into the House of Osiris,<br>
  make ye the well-instructed soul of the Osiris the scribe Ani, whose<br>
  word is true, to enter in and to be with you in the House of Osiris.<br>
  Let him hear even as ye hear; let him have sight even as ye have<br>
  sight; let him stand up even as ye stand up; let him take his seat<br>
  even as ye take your seats.<br>
  Hail, O ye who give cakes and ale to perfect souls in the House of<br>
  Osiris, give ye cakes and ale twice each day (in the morning and in<br>
  the evening) to the soul of the Osiris Ani, whose word is true<br>
  before the gods, the Lords of Abydos, and whose word is true with you.<br>
  Hail, O ye who open up the way, who act as guides to the roads [in<br>
  the Other World] to perfect souls in the House of Osiris, open ye up<br>
  for him the way, and act ye as guides to the roads to the soul of<br>
  the Osiris, the scribe, the registrary of all the offerings made to<br>
  the gods, Ani, [whose word is true] with you. May he enter the House<br>
  of Osiris with boldness, and may he come forth therefrom in peace. May<br>
  there be no opposition made to him, and may he not be sent back<br>
  [therefrom]. May he enter in under favour [of Osiris], and may he come<br>
  forth gratified [at the acceptance of] his true words. May his<br>
  commands be performed in the House of Osiris, may his words travel<br>
  with you, may he be glorious as ye are. May he be not found to be<br>
  light in the Balance, may the Balance dispose of his case.</p>
<p><br>
  (In the Turin Papyrus, ed. Lepsius, this Chapter ends with the<br>
  following.)</p>
<p>Permit thou not me to be judged according to the mouths of the<br>
  multitude. May my soul lift itself up before [Osiris], having been<br>
  found to have been pure when on earth. May I come into thy presence, O<br>
  Lord of the gods; may I arrive at the Nome of Maati (Truth); may I<br>
  rise up on my seat like a god endowed with life; may I give forth<br>
  light like the Company of the Gods who dwell in heaven; may I become<br>
  like one of you; may I lift up my footsteps in the town of Kher-Aha;<br>
  may I look upon the Sektet Boat of the god, Saah, the holy one, as<br>
  it passeth across the sky; may I not be repulsed; may I look upon<br>
  the Lords of the Tuat, or, according to another reading, the Company<br>
  of the Gods; may I smell the savour of the divine food of the<br>
  Company of the Gods; may I sit down with them; may my name be<br>
  proclaimed for offerings by the KHER-HEB priest at the sacrificial<br>
  table; may I hear the petitions which are made when offerings are<br>
  presented; may I draw nigh unto the Neshem Boat; and may neither my<br>
  Heart-soul nor its lord be repulsed.<br>
  Homage to thee, O Chief of Amentet, thou god Osiris, who dwellest in<br>
  the town of Nifu-ur. Grant thou that I may arrive in peace in Amentet.<br>
  May the Lords of Ta-Tchesert receive me, and may they say unto me:<br>
  &quot;Hail, hail; welcome, welcome!&quot; May they make ready for me a seat 
  by<br>
  the side of the President of the Chiefs; may the Nursing-goddesses<br>
  receive me at the seasons, and may I come forth into the presence of<br>
  Un-Nefer true of word. May I be a Follower of Horus in Ra-stau, and of<br>
  Osiris in Tetu; and may I perform all the transformations which my<br>
  heart may desire to make in every place wherein my Double (KA) wisheth<br>
  to be.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: If this text be known [by the deceased] upon earth or if<br>
  he causeth it to be done in writing upon [his] coffin, then will he be<br>
  able to come forth on any day he pleaseth, and to enter into his<br>
  habitation unrepulsed. Cakes and ale and joints of meat from those<br>
  which are on the altar of Ra shall be given unto him, and his<br>
  homestead shall be among the fields of the Field of Reeds<br>
  (Sekhet-Aaru), and wheat and barley shall be given unto him therein,<br>
  and he shall flourish there even as he flourished upon earth.<br>

<p>THE CHAPTER OF MAKING THE SAHU TO ENTER THE TUAT ON THE DAY OF THE<br>
  FUNERAL, WHEN THE FOLLOWING WORDS ARE TO BE SAID: Homage to thee, O<br>
  thou who dwellest in the Holy Hill (Set-Tchesert) of Amentet! the<br>
  Osiris, the royal scribe, Nekhtu-Amen, whose word is true, knoweth<br>
  thee, he knoweth thy name. Deliver thou him from the worms which are<br>
  in Ra-stau, which live upon the bodies of men and women, and feed upon<br>
  their blood, for Osiris, the favoured servant of the god of his<br>
  city, the royal scribe Nekhtu-Amen, knoweth you, and he knoweth your<br>
  names. Let the order for his protection be the first command of<br>
  Osiris, the Lord to the Uttermost Limit, who keepeth his body<br>
  hidden. May he give him release from the Terrible One who dwelleth<br>
  at the bend of the River of Amentet, and may he decree the acts that<br>
  will make him to rise up. Let him pass on to him whose throne is<br>
  placed within the darkness, who giveth light in Ra-stau. O thou Lord<br>
  of Light, come thou and swallow up the worms which are in Amentet. Let<br>
  the Great God who dwelleth in Tetu, and who is himself unseen, hear<br>
  his prayers, and let those who cause afflictions hold him in fear as<br>
  he cometh forth with the sentence of their doom to the Divine Block. I<br>
  the Osiris, the royal scribe, Nekhtu-Amen, come, bearing the decree of<br>
  Neb-er-tcher, and I am the Horus who taketh possession of his throne<br>
  for him. His father, the lord of all those who are in the Boat of<br>
  his Father Horus, hath ascribed praise unto him. He cometh bearing<br>
  tidings....... let him see the town of Anu. Their chief shall stand on<br>
  the earth before him, the scribes shall magnify him at the doors of<br>
  their assemblies, and thy shall swathe im with swathings in Anu. He<br>
  hath led heaven captive, and he hath seized the earth in his grasp.<br>
  Neither the heavens nor the earth can be taken away from him, for,<br>
  behold, he is Ra, the firstborn of the gods. His mother shall nurse<br>
  him, and shall give him her breast on the horizon.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: The words of this Chapter shall be said after [the deceased]<br>
  is laid to rest in Amentet; by means of them the region Tenn-t shall<br>
  be contented with her lord. And the Osiris, the royal scribe,<br>
  Nekhtu-Amen, whose word is truth, shall come forth, and he shall<br>
  embark in the Boat of Ra, and [his] body upon its bier shall be<br>
  counted up, and he shall be established in the Tuat.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF GIVING A MOUTH TO THE OSIRIS ANI, THE SCRIBE, AND<br>
  TELLER OF THE OFFERINGS WHICH ARE MADE TO ALL THE GODS, WHOSE WORD<br>
  IS TRUE, WHO SAITH:- I rise up out of the Egg in the Hidden Land.<br>
  May my mouth be given unto me that I may speak therewith in the<br>
  presence of the Great God, the Lord of the Tuat. Let not my hand and<br>
  my arm be repulsed in the presence of the Chiefs (Tchatchau) of any<br>
  god. I am Osiris, the Lord of Ra-stau. May I, the Osiris, the scribe<br>
  Ani, whose word is true, have my portion with him who is on the top of<br>
  the Steps (Osiris). According to the desire of my heart I have come<br>
  forth from the Island of Nesersert, and I have extinguished the fire.<br>

  [The following passage is taken from the Saite Recension]</p>
<p>[THE CHAPTER OF GIVING A MOUTH TO THE OSIRIS, THE SCRIBE ANI, WHO<br>
  SAITH]:- Homage to thee, O thou lord of brightness, Governor of the<br>
  Temple, Prince of the night and of the thick darkness. I have come<br>
  unto thee. I am shining, I am pure. My hands are about thee, thou hast<br>
  thy lot with thy ancestors. Give thou unto me my mouth that I may<br>
  speak with it. I guide my heart at its season of flame and of night.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: If this Chapter be known by the Osiris the scribe Ani,<br>
  upon earth, [or if it be done] in writing upon [his] coffin, he<br>
  shall come forth by day in every form which he pleaseth, and he<br>
  shall enter into [his] abode, and shall not be repulsed. And cakes,<br>
  and ale, and joints of meat [from those which are on] the altar of<br>
  Osiris shall be given unto him; and he shall enter in peace into<br>
  Sekhet-Aaru, conformably to the decree of the Dweller in Busiris.<br>
  Wheat and barley (dhura) shall be given unto him therein, and he shall<br>
  flourish there just as he did upon earth; and he shall do whatsoever<br>
  it pleaseth him to do, even as do the Company of the Gods who are in<br>
  the Tuat, regularly and continually, for millions of times.</p>

  (From the Paprys of Nebseni, Sheet 3)</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF COMING FORTH BY DAY AND OF OPENING UP A WAY THROUGH<br>
  THE AMEHET: Behold, the scribe Nebseni, whose word is truth, saith:-<br>
  Homage to you, O ye Lords of Kau, ye who are without sin, and who live<br>
  for the endless and infinite aeons of time which make up eternity. I<br>
  have opened up a way for myself to you. I have become a spirit in my<br>
  forms, I have gotten the mastery over my words of magical power, and I<br>
  am adjudged a spirit; therefore deliver ye me from the Crocodile<br>
  [which liveth in] this Country of Truth. Grant ye to me my mouth<br>
  that I may speak therewith, and cause ye that sepulchral offerings<br>
  shall be made unto me in your presence, for I know you, and I know<br>
  your names, and I know also the name of the mighty god before whose<br>
  face ye set your celestial food. His name is &quot;Tekem.&quot; [When] he<br>
  openeth up his path on the eastern horizon of heaven, [when] he<br>
  alighteth towards the western horizon of heaven, may he carry me along<br>
  with him, and may I be safe and sound. Let not the Mesqet make an<br>
  end of me, let not the Fiend (Sebau) gain the mastery over me, let<br>
  me not be driven away from the doors of the Other World, let not you<br>
  doors be shut in my face, for my cakes are in the city of Pe, and my<br>
  ale is in the city of Tep. And there, in the celestial mansions of<br>
  heaven which my divine father Tem hath stablished, let my hands lay<br>
  hold upon the wheat and the barley, which shall be given unto me<br>
  therein in abundant measure, and may the son of my own body make ready<br>
  for me my food therein. And grant ye unto me when I am there<br>
  sepulchral meals, and incense, and unguents, and all the pure and<br>
  beautiful things whereon the god liveth, in every deed for ever, in<br>
  all the transformations which it pleaseth me [to perform], and grant<br>
  unto me the power to float down and to sail up the stream in the Field<br>
  of Reeds (Sekhet-Aaru), [and may I reach Sekhet-hetepet (the Field<br>
  of Offerings)]. I am the twin Lion-gods (Shu and Tefnut).<br>
  TEXTS RELATING TO THE WEIGHING OF THE HEART OF ANI</p>
<p>THE NAMES OF THE GODS OF THE GREAT COMPANY:- 1. Ra Harmakhis, the<br>
  Great God in his boat. 2. Temu. 3. Shu. 4. Tefnut. 5. Keb. 6. Nut, the<br>
  Lady of Heaven. 7. Isis. 8. Nephthys. 9. Horus, the Great God. 10.<br>
  Hathor, Lady of Amentet. 11. Hu. 12. Sa.</p>
<p>THE PRAYER OF ANI:- My heart, my mother; my heart, my mother! My<br>
  heart whereby I came into being! May nought stand up to oppose me at<br>
  [my] judgment, may there be no opposition to me in the presence of the<br>
  Chiefs (Tchatchau); may there be no parting of thee from me in the<br>
  presence of him that keepeth the Balance! Thou art my KA, which<br>
  dwelleth in my body; the god Khnemu who knitteth together and<br>
  strengtheneth my limbs. Mayest thou come forth into the place of<br>
  happiness whither we go. May the Sheniu officials, who make the<br>
  conditions of the lives of men, not cause my name to stink, and may no<br>
  lies be spoken against me in the presence of the God. [Let it be<br>
  satisfactory unto us, and let the Listener god be favourable unto<br>
  us, and let there be joy of heart (to us) at the weighing of words.<br>
  Let not that which is false be uttered against me before the Great<br>
  God, the Lord of Amentet. Verily, how great shalt thou be when thou<br>
  risest in triumph.]</p>
<p>THE SPEECH OF THOTH:- Thoth, the judge of right and truth of the<br>
  Great Company of the Gods who are in the presence of Osiris, saith:<br>
  Hear ye this judgment. The heart of Osiris hath in very truth been<br>
  weighed, and his Heart-soul hath borne testimony on his behalf; his<br>
  heart hath been found right by the trial in the Great Balance. There<br>
  hath not been found any wickedness in him; he hath not wasted the<br>
  offerings which have been made in the temples; he hath not committed<br>
  any evil act; and he hath not set his mouth in motion with words of<br>
  evil whilst he was upon earth.</p>
<p>SPEECH OF THE DWELLER IN THE EMBALMMENT CHAMBER (ANUBIS):- Pay<br>
  good heed, O righteous Judge to the Balance to support [the testimony]<br>
  thereof. Variant: Pay good heed to the weighing in the Balance of<br>
  the heart of the Osiris, the singing-woman of Amen, Anhai, whose<br>
  word is truth, and place thou her heart in the seat of truth in the<br>
  presence of the Great God.</p>
<p>THE SPEECH OF THE GODS:- The Great Company of the Gods say to<br>
  Thoth who dwelleth in Khemenu: That which cometh forth from thy<br>
  mouth shall be declared true. The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is<br>
  true, is holy and righteous. He hath not committed any sin, and he<br>
  hath done no evil against us. The devourer Am-mit shall not be<br>
  permitted to prevail over him. Meat offerings and admittance into<br>
  the presence of the god Osiris shall be granted unto him, together<br>
  with an abiding habitation in the Field of Offerings (Sekhet-hetepet),<br>
  as unto the Followers of Horus.</p>
<p>THE SPEECH OF HORUS TO OSIRIS IN INTRODUCING ANI TO HIM:- Horus, the<br>
  son of Isis, saith: I have come to thee, O Un-Nefer, and I have<br>
  brought unto thee the Osiris Ani. His heart is righteous, and it<br>
  hath come forth from the Balance; it hath not sinned against any god<br>
  or any goddess. Thoth hath weighed it according to the decree<br>
  pronounced unto him by the Company of the Gods, and it is most true<br>
  and righteous. Grant thou that cakes and ale may be given unto him,<br>
  and let him appear in the presence of the god Osiris, and let him be<br>
  like unto the Followers of Horus for ever and ever.</p>
<p>THE SPEECH OF ANI:- And the Osiris Ani saith: Behold, I am in thy<br>
  presence, O Lord of Amentet. There is no sin in my body. I have not<br>
  spoken that which is not true knowingly, nor have I done anything with<br>
  a false heart. Grant thou that I may be like unto those favoured<br>
  ones who are in thy following, and that I may be an Osiris greatly<br>
  favoured of the beautiful god, and beloved of the Lord of the Two<br>
  Lands, I who am a veritable royal scribe who loveth thee, Ani, whose<br>
  word is true before the god Osiris.</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION OF THE BEAST AM-MIT:- Her forepart is like that of a<br>
  crocodile, the middle of her body is like that of a lion, her hind<br>
  quarters are like those of a hippopotamus.</p>
<p>HERE BEGIN THE PRAISES AND GLORIFYINGS OF COMING OUT FROM AND OF<br>
  GOING INTO THE GLORIOUS KHERT-NETER, WHICH IS IN THE BEAUTIFUL<br>
  AMENTET, OF COMING FORTH BY DAY IN ALL THE FORMS OF EXISTENCE WHICH IT<br>
  MAY PLEASE THE DECEASED TO TAKE, OF PLAYING AT DRAUGHTS, OF SITTING IN<br>
  THE SEH HALL, AND OF APPEARING AS A LIVING SOUL:<br>
  The Osiris the scribe Ani saith after he hath arrived in his haven<br>
  of rest- now it is good for [a man] to recite [this work whilst he is]<br>
  upon earth, for then all the words of Tem come to pass-</p>
<p>&quot;I am the god Tem in rising. I am the Only One. I came into<br>
  existence in Nu. I am Ra who rose in the beginning, the ruler of<br>
  this [creation].&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Ra, when at the beginning he rose in the city of Hensu,<br>
  crowned like a king for his coronation. The Pillars of the god Shu<br>
  were not as yet created, when he was upon the steps of him that<br>
  dwelleth in Khemenu.<br>
  &quot;I am the Great God who created himself, even Nu, who made his names<br>
  to become the Company of the Gods as gods.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Ra, the creator of the names of his limbs, which came into<br>
  being in the form of the gods who are in the train of Ra.<br>
  &quot;I am he who cannot be repulsed among the gods.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Temu, the dweller in his disk, but others say that it is Ra<br>
  when he riseth in the eastern horizon of the sky.<br>
  &quot;I am Yesterday, I know To-day.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday is Osiris, and To-day is Ra, when he shall destroy the<br>
  enemies of Neb-er-tcher (the lord to the uttermost limit), and when he<br>
  shall establish as prince and ruler his son Horus.<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that To-day is Ra, on the day when we<br>
  commemorate the festival of the meeting of the dead Osiris with his<br>
  father Ra, and when the battle of the gods was fought, in which<br>
  Osiris, the Lord of Amentet, was the leader.&quot;</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Amentet, [that is to say] the creation ofthe souls of the<br>
  gods when Osiris was leader in Set-Amentet.<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that it is the Amentet which Ra hath given<br>
  unto me; when any god cometh he must rise up and fight for it.<br>
  &quot;I know the god who dwelleth therein.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Osiris. Others, however, say that his name is Ra, and that<br>
  the god who dwelleth in Amentet is the phallus of Ra, wherewith he had<br>
  union with himself.<br>
  &quot;I am the Benu bird which is in Anu. I am the keeper of the volume<br>
  of the book (the Tablet of Destiny) of the things which have been<br>
  made, and of the things which shall be made.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Osiris.<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that it is the dead body of Osiris, and yet<br>
  others say that it is the excrement of Osiris. The things which have<br>
  been made, and the things which shall be made [refer to] the dead body<br>
  of Osiris. Others again say that the things which have been made are<br>
  Eternity, and the things which shall be made are Everlastingness,<br>
  and that Eternity is the Day, and Everlastingness the Night.<br>
  &quot;I am the god Menu in his coming forth; may his two plumes be set on<br>
  my head for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;Menu is Horis, the Advocate of his father [Osiris], and his<br>
  coming forth means his birth. The two plumes on his head are Isis<br>
  and Nephthys, when these goddesses go forth and set themselves<br>
  thereon, and when they act as his protectors, and when they provide<br>
  that which his head lacketh.<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that the two plumes are the two exceedingly<br>
  large uraei which are upon the head of their father Tem, and there are<br>
  yet others who say that the two plumes which are upon the head of Menu<br>
  are his two eyes.<br>
  &quot;The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is true, the registrar of all<br>
  the offerings which are made to the gods, riseth up and cometh into<br>
  his city.&quot;</p>
<p>What is this [city]?</p>
<p>&quot;It is the horizon of his father Tem.<br>
  &quot;I have made an end of my shortcomings, and I have put away my<br>
  faults.&quot;</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is the cutting of the navel string of the body of the Osiris the<br>
  scribe Ani, whose word is true before all the gods, and all his faults<br>
  are driven out.</p>
<p>What is this ?</p>
<p>&quot;It is the purification [of Osiris] on the day of his birth.<br>
  &quot;I am purified in my great double nest which is in Hensu on the<br>
  day of the offerings of the followers of the Great God who dwelleth<br>
  therein.&quot;</p>
<p>What is the &quot;great double nest&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;The name of one nest is 'Millions of years,' and 'Great Green<br>
  [Sea]' is the name of the other, that is to say 'Lake of Natron' and<br>
  'Lake of Salt.'<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say the name of the one is 'Guide of Millions of<br>
  Years,' and that 'Great Green Lake' is name of the other. Yet others<br>
  say that 'Begetter of Millions of Years' is the name of one, and<br>
  'Great Green Lake' is the name of the other. Now, as concerning the<br>
  Great God who dwelleth therein, it is Ra himself.<br>
  &quot;I pass over the way, I know the head of the Island of Maati.&quot;</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Ra-stau, that is to say, it is the gate to the South of<br>
  Nerutef, and it is the Northern Gate of the Domain (Tomb of the god).<br>
  &quot;Now, as concerning the Island of Maati, it is Abtu.<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that it is the way by which Father Tem<br>
  travelleth when he goeth forth to Sekhet-Aaru, [the place] which<br>
  produceth the food and sustenance of the gods who are [in] their<br>
  shrines.<br>
  &quot;Now the Gate Tchesert is the Gate of the Pillars of Shu, that is to<br>
  say, the Northern Gate of the Tuat.<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that the Gate of Tchesert is the two leaves of<br>
  the door through which the god Tem passeth when he goeth forth to<br>
  the eastern horizon of the sky.<br>
  &quot;O ye gods who are in the presence [of Osiris], grant to me your<br>
  arms, for I am the god who shall come into being among you.&quot;</p>
<p>Who are these gods?</p>
<p>&quot;They are the drops of blood which came forth from the phallus of Ra<br>
  when he went forth to perform his own mutilitation. These drops of<br>
  blood sprang into being under the forms of the gods Hu and Sa, who are<br>
  in the bodyguard of Ra, and who accompany the god Tem daily and<br>
  every day.<br>
  &quot;I, Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, have filled for thee<br>
  the utchat (the Eye of Ra, or of Horus), when it had suffered<br>
  extinction on the day of the combat of the Two Fighters (Horus and<br>
  Set).&quot;</p>
<p>What was this combat?</p>
<p>It was the combat which took place on the day when Horus fought with<br>
  Set, during which Set threw filth in the face of Horus, and Horus<br>
  crushed the genitals of Set. The filling of the utchat Thoth performed<br>
  with his own fingers.<br>
  &quot;I remove the thunder-cloud from the sky when there is a storm<br>
  with thunder and lightning therein.&quot;</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>&quot;This storm was the raging of Ra at the thunder-cloud which [Set]<br>
  sent forth against the Right Eye of Ra (the Sun). Thoth removed the<br>
  thunder-cloud from the Eye of Ra, and brought back the Eye living,<br>
  healthy, sound, and with no defect in it to its owner.<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that the thunder-cloud is caused by sickness<br>
  in the Eye of Ra, which weepeth for its companion Eye (the Moon); at<br>
  this time Thoth cleanseth the Right Eye of Ra.<br>
  &quot;I behold Ra who was born yesterday from the thighs of the goddess<br>
  Mehurt; his strength is my strength, and my strength is his strength.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;Mehurt is the great Celestial Water, but others say that Mehurt<br>
  is the image of the Eye of Ra at dawn at his birth daily.<br>
  &quot;[Others, however, say that] Mehurt is the utchat of Ra.<br>
  &quot;Now Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, is a very great one<br>
  among the gods who are in the following of Horus; they say that he<br>
  is the prince who loveth his lord.&quot;</p>
<p>Who are the gods who are in the train of Horus?</p>
<p>&quot;[They are] Kesta, Hapi, Taumutef, and Qebhsenuf.<br>
  &quot;Homage to you, O ye lords of right and truth, ye sovereign<br>
  princes (Tchatcha) who [stand] round about Osiris, who do away utterly<br>
  sins and offences, and who are in the following of the goddess<br>
  Hetepsekhus, grant ye that I may come unto you. Destroy ye all the<br>
  faults which are within me, even as ye did for the Seven Spirits who<br>
  are among the followers of their lord Sepa. Anpu (Anubis) appointed to<br>
  them their places on the day [when he said unto them], &quot;Come ye<br>
  hither.&quot;</p>
<p>Who are the &quot;lords of right and truth&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;The lords of right and truth are Thoth and Astes, the Lord of<br>
  Amentet.<br>
  &quot;The Tchatcha round about Osiris are Kesta, Hapi, Tuamutef, and<br>
  Qebhsenuf, and they are also round about the Constellation of the<br>
  Thigh (the Great Bear), in the northern sky.<br>
  &quot;Those who do away utterly sins and offences, and who are in the<br>
  following of the goddess Hetepsekhus, are the god Sebek and his<br>
  associates who dwell in the water.<br>
  &quot;The goddess Hetepsekhus is the Eye of Ra.<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that it is the flame which accompanieth Osiris<br>
  to burn up the souls of his enemies.<br>
  &quot;As concerning all the faults which are in Osiris, the registrar<br>
  of the offerings which are made unto all the gods, Ani, whose word<br>
  is truth, [these are all the offences which he hath committed<br>
  against the Lords of Eternity] since he came forth from his mother's<br>
  womb.<br>
  &quot;As concerning the Seven Spirits who are Kesta, Hapi, Tuamutef,<br>
  Qebhsenuf, Maa-atef, Kheribeqef and Heru-khenti-en-ariti, these did<br>
  Anubis appoint to be protectors of the dead body of Osiris.<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that he set them round about the holy place of<br>
  Osiris.<br>
  &quot;Others say that the Seven Spirits [which were appointed by<br>
  Anubis] were Netcheh-netcheh, Aatqetqet, Nertanef-besef-khenti-hehf,<br>
  Aq-her-ami-unnut-f, Tesher-ariti-ami-Het-anes,<br>
  Ubes-her-per-em-khetkhet, and Maaem-kerh-annef-em-hru.<br>
  &quot;The chief of the Tchatcha (sovereign princes) who is in Naarutef is<br>
  Horus, the Advocate of his father.<br>
  &quot;As concerning the day wherein [Anubis said to the Seven Spirits],<br>
  'Come ye hither,' [the allusion here] is to the words 'Come ye<br>
  hither,' which Ra spake unto Osiris.&quot;</p>
<p>Verily may these same words be said unto me in Amentet.</p>
<p>&quot;I am the Divine Soul which dwelleth in the Divine Twin-gods.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this Divine Soul?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Osiris. [When] he goeth into Tetu, and findeth there the Soul<br>
  of Ra, the one god embraceth the other, and two Divine Souls spring<br>
  into being within the Divine Twin-gods.&quot;<br>
  APPENDIX<br>
  APPENDIX<br>
  (From the Papyrus of Nebseni, Brit. Mus. No. 9900, Sheet 14, ll.<br>
  16ff.)</p>
<p>&quot;As concerning the Divine Twin-gods they are Heru-netch-her-tefef<br>
  and Heru-khent-en-Ariti (Horus the Advocate of his father [Osiris],<br>
  and Horus the sightless).<br>
  &quot;Others say that the double Divine Soul which dwelleth in the Divine<br>
  Twin-gods is the Soul of Ra and the Soul of Osiris, and yet others say<br>
  that it is the Soul which dwelleth in Shu, and the Sould which<br>
  dwelleth in Tefnut, and that these two Souls form the double Divine<br>
  Soul which dwelleth in Tetu.<br>
  &quot;I am the Cat which fought near the Persea Tree in Anu on the<br>
  night when the foes of Neb-er-tcher were destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this Cat?</p>
<p>&quot;This male Cat is Ra himself, and he was called 'Mau' because of the<br>
  speech of the god Sa, who said concerning him: 'He is like (mau)<br>
  unto that which he hath made'; therefore, did the name of Ra become<br>
  'Mau.'<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that the male Cat is the god Shu, who made<br>
  over the possessions of Keb to Osiris.<br>
  &quot;As concerning the fight which took place near the Persea Tree in<br>
  Anu [these words have reference to the slaughter] of the children of<br>
  rebellion, when righteous retribution was meted out to them for [the<br>
  evil] which they had done.<br>
  &quot;As concerning the 'night of the battle,' [these words refer to] the<br>
  invasion of the eastern portion of the heaven by the children of<br>
  rebellion, whereupon a great battle arose in heaven and in all the<br>
  earth.<br>
  &quot;O thou who art in thine egg (Ra,) who showest from thy Disk, who<br>
  risest on thy horizon, and dost shine with golden beams in the<br>
  height of heaven, like unto whom there is none among the gods, who<br>
  sailest above the Pillars of Shu, who sendest forth blasts of fire<br>
  from thy mouth, [who illuminest the Two Lands with thy splendour,<br>
  deliver] thou Nebseni, the lord of fealty [to Osiris], from the god<br>
  whose form is hidden, and whose eyebrows are like unto the two arms of<br>
  the Balance on the night when the sentences of doom are promulgated.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this invisible god?</p>
<p>&quot;It is An-a-f (he who bringeth his arm.).<br>
  &quot;As concerning 'the night when the sentences of doom are<br>
  promulgated,' it is the night of the burning of the damned, and of the<br>
  overthrow of the wicked at the Block, and of the slaughter of souls.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this [slaughterer of souls]?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Shesmu, the headsman of Osiris.<br>
  &quot;[Concerning the invisible god] some say that he is Aapep when he<br>
  riseth up with a head bearing upon it [the feather of] Maat (Truth).<br>
  But others say that he is Horus when he riseth up with two heads,<br>
  whereon one beareth [the feather of] Maat, and the other [the symbol<br>
  of] wickedness. He bestoweth wickedness on him that worketh<br>
  wickedness, and right and truth upon him that followeth<br>
  righteousness and truth.<br>
  &quot;Others say that he is Heru-ur (the Old Horus), who dwelleth in<br>
  Sekhem; others say that he is Thoth; others say that he is<br>
  Nefer-Tem; and others say that he is Sept who doth bring to nought the<br>
  acts of the foes of Nebertcher.<br>
  &quot;Deliver thou the scribe Nebseni, whose word is truth, from the<br>
  Watchers, who carry murderous knives, who possess cruel fingers, and<br>
  who would slay those who are in the following of Osiris.&quot;<br>
  May these Watchers never gain the mastery over me, and may I never<br>
  fall under their knives!</p>
<p>Who are these Watchers?</p>
<p>&quot;They are Anubis and Horus, [the latter being] in the form of<br>
  Horus the sightless. Others, however, say that they are the Tchatcha<br>
  (sovereign princes of Osiris), who bring to nought the operations of<br>
  their knives; and others say that they are the chiefs of the Sheniu<br>
  chamber.<br>
  &quot;May their knives never gain the mastery over me. May I never fall<br>
  under the knives wherewith they inflict cruel tortures. For I know<br>
  their names, and I know the being, Matchet, who is among them in the<br>
  House of Osiris. He shooteth forth rays of light from his eye, being<br>
  himself invisible, and he goeth round about heaven robed in the flames<br>
  which come from his mouth, commanding Hapi, but remaining invisible<br>
  himself. May I be strong on earth before Ra, may I arrive safely in<br>
  the presence of Osiris. O ye who preside over your altars, let not<br>
  your offerings to me be wanting, for I am one of those who follow<br>
  after Nebertcher, according to the writings of Khepera. Let me fly<br>
  like a hawk, let me cackle like a goose, let me lay always like the<br>
  serpent-goddess Neheb-ka.&quot;</p>
<p>Who are those who preside over their altars?</p>
<p>&quot;Those who preside over their altars are the similitude of the Eye<br>
  of Ra, and the similitude of the Eye of Horus.<br>
  &quot;O Ra-Tem, thou Lord of the Great House [in Anu], thou Sovereign<br>
  (life, strentgh, health [be to thee]) of all the gods, deliver thou<br>
  the scribe Nebseni, whose word is truth, from the god whose face is<br>
  like unto that of a greyhound, whose brows are like those of a man,<br>
  who feedeth upon the dead, who watcheth at the Bend of the Lake of<br>
  Fire, who devoureth the bodies of the dead, and swalloweth hearts, and<br>
  who voideth filth, but who himself remaineth unseen.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this greyhound-faced god?</p>
<p>&quot;His name is 'Everlasting Devourer,' and he liveth in the Domain [of<br>
  Fire] (the Lake of Unt).<br>
  &quot;As concerning the Domain of Fire, it is that Aat which is in<br>
  Naarutef, and is near the Sheniu chamber. The sinner who walketh<br>
  over this place falleth down among the knives [of the Watchers].<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that the name of this god is 'Mates,' and that<br>
  he keepeth watch over the door of Amentet; others say that his name is<br>
  'Beba,' and that he keepeth watch over the Bend [of the stream] of<br>
  Amentet, and yet others say that his name is 'Herisepef.'<br>
  &quot;Hail, Lord of Terror, Chief of the Lands of the South and North,<br>
  thou Lord of the Desert, who dost keep prepared the block of<br>
  slaughter, and who dost feed on the intestines [of men]!&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this Lord of Terror?</p>
<p>&quot;It is the Keeper of the Bend [of the stream] of Amentet.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this Keeper?</p>
<p>&quot;It is the Heart of Osiris, which is the devourer of all slaughtered<br>
  things.<br>
  &quot;The Urrt Crown hath been given unto him, with gladness of heart, as<br>
  Lord of Hensu.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;He to whom the Urrt Crown hath been given with gladness of heart as<br>
  Lord of Hensu is Osiris. He was bidden to rule among the gods on the<br>
  day of the union of earth [with earth] in the presence of Nebertcher.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;He who was bidden to rule among the gods is the son of Isis<br>
  (Horus), who was appointed to rule in the room of his father Osiris.<br>
  &quot;As concerning [the words] 'day of the union of earth with earth,'<br>
  they have reference to the union of earth with earth in the coffin<br>
  of Osiris, the Soul that liveth in Hensu, the giver of meat and drink,<br>
  the destroyer of wrong, and the guide to the everlasting paths.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Ra himself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;[Deliver thou the Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth]<br>
  from the great god who carrrieth away souls, who eateth hearts, who<br>
  feedeth upon offal, who keepeth watch in the darkness, who dwelleth in<br>
  the Seker Boat; those who live in sin fear him.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Suti, but others say that it is Smamur, the soul of Keb.<br>
  &quot;Hail, Khepera in thy boat, the two Companies of the Gods are in thy<br>
  body. Deliver thou the Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth,<br>
  from the Watchers who pass sentences of doom, who have been<br>
  appointed by the god Nebertcher to protect him, and to fasten the<br>
  fetters on his foes, and who slaughter in the torture chambers;<br>
  there is no escape from their fingers. May they never stab me with<br>
  their knives, may I never fall helpless into their chambers of<br>
  torture. I have never done the things which the gods hate. I am he who<br>
  is pure in the Mesqet chamber. And saffron cakes have been brought<br>
  unto him in Tannt.&quot;</p>
<p>Who is this?</p>
<p>&quot;It is Khepera in his boat; it is Ra himself.<br>
  &quot;As concerning the Watchers who pass sentences of doom, they are the<br>
  Apes Isis and Nephthys.<br>
  &quot;As concerning the things which the gods hate, they are acts of<br>
  deceit and lying. He who passeth through the place of purification<br>
  within the Mesqet chamber is Anpu (Anubis), who is hard by the<br>
  coffer which containeth the inward parts of Osiris. He to whom saffron<br>
  cakes have been brought in Tannt is Osiris.<br>
  &quot;Others, however, say that the saffron cakes in Tannt represent<br>
  heaven and earth, and others say that they represent Shu, the<br>
  strengthener of the Two Lands in Hensu; and others say that they<br>
  represent the Eye of Horus, and that Tannt is the burial-place of<br>
  Osiris.<br>
  &quot;Tem hath builded thy house, and the double Lion-god hath laid the<br>
  foundations of thy habitation. Lo! medicaments have been brought.<br>
  Horus purifieth Set and Set strengtheneth, and Set purifieth and Horus<br>
  strengtheneth.<br>
  &quot;The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth before Osiris,<br>
  hath come into this land, and he hath taken possession thereof with<br>
  his two feet. He is Tem, and he is in the city.<br>
  &quot;Turn thou back, O Rehu, whose mouth shineth, whose head moveth,<br>
  turn thou back before his strength.&quot; Another reading is, 'Turn thou<br>
  back from him who keepeth watch, and is himself unseen.' Let the<br>
  Osiris Ani be safely guarded. He is Isis, and he is found with her<br>
  hair spread over him; it is shaken out over his brow. He was conceived<br>
  by Isis, and engendered by Nephthys, and they have cut away from him<br>
  the things which should be cut from him.<br>
  &quot;Fear followeth after thee, terror is about thine arms. Thou hast<br>
  been embraced for millions of years by arms; mortals go round about<br>
  thee. Thou smitest down the mediators of thy foes, and thou seizest<br>
  the arms of the power of darkness. Thy two sisters (Isis and Nephthys)<br>
  are given to thee for thy delight. Thou hast created that which is<br>
  in Kher-aha, and that which is Anu. Every god feareth thee, for thou<br>
  art exceedingly great and terrible; thou [avengest] every god on the<br>
  man who curseth him, and thou shootest arrows at him. Thou livest<br>
  according to thy will. Thou art Uatchet, the Lady of Flame, evil<br>
  befalleth those who set themselves up against thee.&quot;</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>&quot;'Hidden in form, given of Menhu,' is the name of the &quot;tomb. 'He 
  who<br>
  seeth what is on his hand' is the name of Qerau, or, as others say, it<br>
  is the name of the Block.<br>
  &quot;Now, he whose mouth shineth and whose head moveth is the phallus of<br>
  Osiris, but others say it is [the phallus] of Ra. 'Thou spreadest<br>
  thy hair, and I shake it out over his brow&quot; is said concerning Isis,<br>
  who hideth in her hair, and draweth it round about her.<br>
  &quot;Uatchet, the Lady of Flames, is the Eye of Ra.&quot;<br>
  THE SEVEN ARITS</p>
<p><br>
  The First Arit.</p>
<p>The name of the Doorkeeper is Sekhet-her-asht-aru. The name of the<br>
  Watcher is Smetti. The name of the Herald is Hakheru.<br>
  The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, shall say when he cometh unto<br>
  the First Arit: &quot;I am the mighty one who createth his own light. I<br>
  have come unto thee, O Osiris, and, purified from that which<br>
  defileth thee, I adore thee. Lead on. Name not the name of Ra-stau<br>
  to me. Homage to thee, O Osiris, in thy might and in thy strength in<br>
  Ra-stau. Rise up and conquer, O Osiris, in Abtu. Thou goest round<br>
  about heaven, thou sailest in the presence of Ra, thou lookest upon<br>
  all the beings who have knowledge. Hail, Ra, thou who goest round<br>
  about in the sky, I say, O Osiris in truth, that I am the Sahu<br>
  (Spirit-body) of the god, and I beseech thee not to let me be driven<br>
  away, nor to be cast upon the wall of blazing fire. Let the way be<br>
  opened in Ra-stau, let the pain of the Osiris be relieved, embrace<br>
  that which the Balance hath weighed, let a path be made for the Osiris<br>
  in the Great Valley, and let the Osiris have light to guide him on his<br>
  way.&quot;</p>

  The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he cometh to<br>
  this Arit]: &quot;He sitteth to carry out his heart's desire, and he<br>
  weigheth words as the Second of Thoth. The strength which protecteth<br>
  Thoth humbleth the hidden Maati gods, who feed upon Maat during the<br>
  years of their lives. I offer up my offerings [to him] at the moment<br>
  when he maketh his way. I advance, and I enter on the path. O grant<br>
  thou that I may continue to advance, and that I may attain to the<br>
  sight of Ra, and of those who offer up [their] offerings.&quot;</p>

  Watcher is Seres-her. The name of the Herald is Aa.<br>
  The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he<br>
  cometh to this Arit]: &quot;I am he who is hidden in the great deep. I am<br>
  the Judge of the Rehui, I have come and I have done away the offensive<br>
  thing which was upon Osiris. I tie firmly the place on which he<br>
  standeth, coming forth from the Urt. I have stablished things in Abtu,<br>
  I have opened up a way through Ra-stau, and I have relieved the pain<br>
  which was in Osiris. I have balanced the place whereon he standeth,<br>
  and I have made a path for him; he shineth brilliantly in Ra-stau.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
  The Fourth Arit.</p>
<p>The name of the Doorkeeper is Khesef-her-asht-kheru. The name of the<br>
  Watcher is Seres-tepu. The name of the Herald is Khesef-at.<br>
  The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he<br>
  cometh to this Arit]: &quot;I am the Bull, the son of the ancestress of<br>
  Osiris. O grant ye that his father, the Lord of his god-like<br>
  companions, may bear witness on his behalf. I have weighed the<br>
  guilty in judgment. I have brought unto his nostrils the life which is<br>
  ever lasting. I am the son of Osiris, I have accomplished the journey,<br>
  I have advanced in Khert-Neter.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
  The Fifth Arit.</p>
<p>The name of the Doorkeeper is Ankhf-em-fent. The name of the Watcher<br>
  is Shabu. The name of the Herald is Teb-her-kha-kheft.<br>
  The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he<br>
  cometh to this Arit]: &quot;I have brought unto thee the jawbone in<br>
  Ra-stau. I have brought unto thee thy backbone in Anu. I have gathered<br>
  together his manifold members therein. I have driven back Aapep for<br>
  thee. I have spit upon the wounds [in his body]. I have made myself<br>
  a path among you. I am the Aged One among the gods. I have made<br>
  offerings to Osiris. I have defended him with the word of truth. I<br>
  have gathered together his bones, and have collected all his members.&quot;</p>
<p><br>
  The Sixth Arit.</p>
<p>The name of the Doorkeeper is Atek-tau-kehaq-kheru. The name of<br>
  the Watcher is An-her. The name of the Herald is Ates-her-[ari]-she.<br>
  The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he<br>
  cometh to this Arit]: &quot;I have come daily, I have come daily. I have<br>
  made myself a way. I have advanced over that which was created by Anpu<br>
  (Anubis). I am the Lord of the Urrt Crown. I am the possessor [of<br>
  the knowledge of] the words of magical power, I am the Avenger<br>
  according to law, I have avenged [the injury to] his Eye. I have<br>
  defended Osiris. I have accomplished my journey. The Osiris Ani<br>
  advanceth with you with the word which is truth.&quot;</p>

<p>The name of the Doorkeeper is Sekhmet-em-tsu-sen. The name of the<br>
  Watcher is Aa-maa-kheru. The name of the Herald is Khesef-khemi.<br>
  The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, shall say [when he<br>
  cometh to this Arit]: &quot;I have come unto thee, O Osiris, being purified<br>
  from foul emissions. Thou goest round about heaven, thou seest Ra,<br>
  thou seest the beings who have knowledge. [Hail], thou, ONE! Behold,<br>
  thou art in the Sektet Boat which traverseth the heavens. I speak what<br>
  I will to his Sahu (Spirit-body). He is strong, and cometh into<br>
  being even [as] he spake. Thou meetest him face to face. Prepare<br>
  thou for me all the ways which are good [and which lead] to thee.&quot;</p>
<p>RUBRIC: If [these] words be recited by the spirit when he shall come<br>
  to the Seven Arits, and as he entereth the doors, he shall neither<br>
  be turned back nor repulsed before Osiris, and he shall be made to<br>
  have his being among the blessed spirits, and to have dominion among<br>
  the ancestral followers of Osiris. If these things be done for any<br>
  spirit he shall have his being in that place like a lord of eternity<br>
  in one body with Osiris, and at no place shall any being contend<br>
  against him.<br>

  APPENDIX<br>
  APPENDIX<br>
  (From the Turin Papryus, ed. Lepsius, Bl. 64, the text referring<br>
  to the twenty-first Pylon.)</p>
<p>THE OSIRIS AUFANKH, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH, SAITH: Hail, saith Horus, O<br>
  Twenty-first pylon of the Still-Heart! I have made the way. I know<br>
  thee. I know thy name. I know the name of the goddess who guardeth<br>
  thee. &quot;Sword that smiteth at the utterance of its own name, stinking<br>
  face, overthrower of him that approacheth her flame&quot; is thy name. Thou<br>
  keepest the hidden things of the avenger of the god, thou guardest<br>
  them. Amam is his name. He maketh the ash trees (cedars) not to<br>
  grow, and the shenu trees (acacias) not to blossom, and preventeth<br>
  copper from being found in the mountain. The Tchatcha (Chiefs) of this<br>
  Pylon are Seven Gods. Tchen, or Anthch (At), is the name of the one at<br>
  the door. Hetepmes is the name of another there. Messep is the name of<br>
  another there. Utchara is the name of another there. Beq is the name<br>
  of another there. Anp (Anubis) is the name of another there.<br>
  I have made the way. I am Menu-Heru, the avenger of his father,<br>
  the heir of his father Un-Nefer. I have come. I have given [offerings]<br>
  to my father Osiris. I have overthrown all his enemies. I have come<br>
  daily with the word of truth, the lord of fealty, in the house of my<br>
  father Tem, the Lord of Anu, I, the Osiris Auf-ankh, whose word is<br>
  truth in the southern heaven. I have done what is right for him that<br>
  made the right, I have celebrated the Haker festival to the lord<br>
  thereof. I have acted as the leader of the festivals. I have given<br>
  cakes to the Lords of the Altar. I have been the leader of the<br>
  propitiatory offerings, cakes, ale, oxen, geese, to my father Osiris<br>
  Un-Nefer. I am the protector of the Ba-soul, I have made the Benu bird<br>
  to appear [by my] words. I have come daily into the house of the god<br>
  to make offerings of incense. I have come with the shenti tunic. I<br>
  have set the Neshem Boat afloat on the water. I have made the word<br>
  of Osiris Khenti Amenti to be truth before his enemies. I have carried<br>
  away in a boat all his enemies to the slaughter-house of the East, and<br>
  they shall never escape from the wardship of the god Keb who<br>
  dwelleth therein. I have made the Kefaiu gods of Ra to stand up, I<br>
  have made his word to be truth. I have come as a scribe. I have<br>
  explained [the writings]. I have made the god to have power over his<br>
  legs. I have come into the house of him that is upon his mountain<br>
  (Anubis). I have seen the Chief of the Seh hall. I have entered into<br>
  Ra-stau. I have made myself invisible. I have found for myself the<br>
  boundary. I have approached Nerutef. I have clothed the naked. I<br>
  have sailed up the river to Abydos. I have performed the ceremonies of<br>
  Hu and Sa. I have entered the house of Astes. I have made supplication<br>
  to the Khati gods and to Sekhmet in the temple of Net (Neith), or<br>
  the Aged Ones. I have entered Ra-stau. I have made myself invisible. I<br>
  have found the frontier. I have approached Nerutef. I have clothed the<br>
  naked. I have sailed up the river to Abydos. I have performed the<br>
  ceremonies of Hu and Sa. I have received. I have risen like a king<br>
  crowned. I fill my seat on the throne in the place of my father, the<br>
  God Who was at the beginning. I have praised the Meskhen of<br>
  Ta-tchesert. My mouth is full of Maat (Truth). I have overwhelmed<br>
  the Akhekhau serpents. I have come into the Great House with [my] body<br>
  in a flourishing condition. I have caused myself to travel in the Boat<br>
  of Hai. The myrrh unguent of..... is in the hair of men (Rekhit). I<br>
  have entered into the House of Astes. I have approached with worship<br>
  the two Khati gods and Sekhmet, who are in the temple of the Aged<br>
  One [in Anu].<br>
  [And the god Osiris saith:] &quot;Thou hast come, thou shalt be a<br>
  favoured one in Tetu, O Osiris Auf-ankh, whose word is truth, the<br>
  son of the lady Shert-en-Menu, whose word is truth.&quot;<br>
  THE PRIESTS ANMUTEF AND SAMEREF</p>
<p>THE SPEECH OF THE PRIEST ANMUTEF.<br>
  I have come unto you, O ye great Tchatcha Chiefs who dwell in<br>
  heaven, and upon earth, and in Khert-Neter, and I have brought unto<br>
  you the Osiris Ani. He hath not committed any act which is an<br>
  abomination before all the gods. Grant ye that he may live with you<br>
  every day.<br>
  The Osiris the scribe Ani adoreth Osiris, Lord of Rasta, and the<br>
  Great Company of the Gods who live in Khert-Neter. He saith: &quot;Homage<br>
  to thee, Khenti Amenti, Un-Nefer, who dwellest in Abtu. I come to<br>
  thee. My heart holdeth Truth. There is no sin in my body. I have not<br>
  told a lie wittingly, I have not acted in a double manner. Grant<br>
  thou to me cakes, let me appear in the presence, at the altar of the<br>
  Lords of Truth, let me go in and come forth from Khert-Neter [at<br>
  will], let not my Heart-soul be driven away [from me]; and grant me<br>
  a sight of the Disk and the beholding of the Moon for ever and ever.</p>
<p><br>
  THE SPEECH OF THE PRIEST SAMEREF.<br>
  I have come unto you, O ye Tchatcha Chiefs who dwell in Rasta, and I<br>
  have brought unto you the Osiris Ani, grant ye unto him cakes, and<br>
  water, and air, and a homestead in Sekhet-hetep as to the followers of<br>
  Horus.<br>
  The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, adoreth Osiris,<br>
  the Lord of everlastingness, and the Tchatcha Chiefs, the Lords of<br>
  Rasta. He saith: &quot;Homage to thee, O King of Khert-Neter, thou Governor<br>
  of Akert! I have come unto thee. I know thy plans, I am equipped<br>
  with the forms which thou takest in the Tuat. Give thou to me a<br>
  place in Khert-Neter, near the Lords of Truth. May my homestead be<br>
  lasting in Sekhet-hetep, may I receive cakes in thy presence.&quot;<br>
  THE JUDGES IN ANU</p>
<p>Hail, Thoth, who madest to be true the word of Osiris against his<br>
  enemies, make thou the word of the scribe Nebseni to be true against<br>
  his enemies, even as thou didst make the word of Osiris to be true<br>
  against his enemies, in the presence of the Tchatcha Chiefs who are<br>
  with Ra and Osiris in Anu, on the night of the &quot;things of the<br>
  night,&quot; and the night of battle, and of the fettering of the Sebau<br>
  fiends, and the day of the destruction of the enemies of Neb-er-tcher.</p>
<p>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs in Anu are Tem, Shu, Tefnut, [Osiris<br>
  and Thoth]. Now the &quot;fettering of the Sebau fiends&quot; signifieth the<br>
  destruction of the Smaiu fiends of Set, when he wrought iniquity a<br>
  second time.<br>
  Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against<br>
  his enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris Ani to be true against<br>
  his enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Tetu, on the<br>
  night of setting up the Tet in Tetu.</p>
<p>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Tetu are Osiris, Isis,<br>
  Nephthys, and Horus the avenger of his father. Now the &quot;setting up<br>
  of the Tet in Tetu&quot; signifieth [the raising up of] the shoulder of<br>
  Horus, the Governor of Sekhem. They are round about Osiris in the band<br>
  [and] the bandages.<br>
  Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against<br>
  his enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris Ani to be true against<br>
  his enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Sekhem, on<br>
  the night of the &quot;things of the night&quot; in Sekhem.</p>
<p>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Sekhem are<br>
  Heru-khenti-en-ariti and Thoth who is with the Tchatcha Chiefs of<br>
  Nerutef. Now the night of the &quot;things of the night festival&quot;<br>
  signifieth the dawn on the sarcophagus of Osiris.<br>
  Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against<br>
  his enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris the scribe Ani to be<br>
  true against his enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in<br>
  the double town Pe-Tep, on the night of setting up the &quot;Senti&quot; of<br>
  Horus, and of establishing him in the inheritance of the possessions<br>
  of his father Osiris.</p>
<p>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Pe-Tep are Horus, Isis,<br>
  Kesta (Mesta) and Hapi. Now the &quot;setting up of the 'Senti' of Horus&quot;<br>
  hath reference to the words which Set spake to his followers, saying<br>
  &quot;Set up the Senti.&quot;<br>
  Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against<br>
  his enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris the scribe Ani to be<br>
  true, in peace, against his enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs<br>
  who are in the Lands of the Rekhti (Taiu-Rekhti), in the night when<br>
  Isis lay down, and kept watch to make lamentation for her brother<br>
  Osiris.</p>
<p>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Taiu-Rekhti are Isis,<br>
  Horus, Kesta (Mesta) [Anpu and Thoth].<br>
  Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris true against his<br>
  enemies, make thou the word of Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is<br>
  truth, in peace, to be true against his enemies, with the great<br>
  Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Abtu, on the night of the god Haker, when<br>
  the dead are separated, and the spirits are judged, and when the<br>
  procession taketh place in Teni.</p>
<p>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Abtu are Osiris, Isis,<br>
  and Up-uat.<br>
  Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against<br>
  his enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris, the scribe and assessor<br>
  of the sacred offerings which are made to all the gods, Ani, to be<br>
  true against his enemies, with the Tchatcha Chiefs who examine the<br>
  dead on the night of making the inspection of those who are to be<br>
  annihilated.</p>
<p>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are present at the examination<br>
  of the dead are Thoth, Osiris, Anpu and Asten (read Astes). Now the<br>
  inspection (or, counting) of those who are to be annihilated<br>
  signifieth the shutting up of things from the souls of the sons of<br>
  revolt.<br>
  Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris true against his<br>
  enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris the scribe Ani to be true<br>
  against his enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are present at<br>
  the digging up of the earth [and mixing it] with their blood, and of<br>
  making the word of Osiris to be true against his enemies.</p>
<p>As concerning the Tchatcha Chiefs who are present at the digging<br>
  up of the earth in Tetu: When the Smaiu fiends of Set came [there],<br>
  having transformed themselves into animals, these Tchatcha Chiefs slew<br>
  them in the presence of the gods who were there, and they took their<br>
  blood, and carried it to them. These things were permitted at the<br>
  examination [of the wicked] by those [gods] who dwelt in Tetu.<br>
  Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris to be true against<br>
  his enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris [the scribe] Ani to be<br>
  true against his enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in<br>
  Nerutef on the night of the &quot;Hidden of Forms.&quot;</p>
<p>Now the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Nerutef are Ra, Osiris, Shu<br>
  and Bebi.<br>
  Now, the night of the &quot;Hidden of Forms&quot; referreth to the placing<br>
  on the sarcophagus [of Osiris] the arm, the heel, and the thigh of<br>
  Osiris Un-Nefer.<br>
  Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris true against his<br>
  enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris, whose word is truth, to<br>
  be true against his enemies, with the great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in<br>
  Rasta, on the night when Anpu lay with his arms on the things by<br>
  Osiris, and when the word of Horus was make to be true against his<br>
  enemies.</p>
<p>The great Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Rasta are Horus, Osiris, and<br>
  Isis. The heart of Osiris is happy, the heart of Horus is glad, and<br>
  the two halves of Egypt (Aterti) are well satisfied thereat.<br>
  Hail, Thoth, who didst make the word of Osiris true against his<br>
  enemies, make thou the word of the Osiris the scribe Ani, the assessor<br>
  of the holy offerings made to all the gods, to be true against his<br>
  enemies, with the Ten great Tchatcha Chiefs who are with Ra, and<br>
  with Osiris, and with every god, and with every goddess, in the<br>
  presence of the god Nebertcher. He hath destroyed his enemies, and<br>
  he hath destroyed every evil thing which appertained to him.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: If this Chapter be recited for, or over, the deceased, he<br>
  shall come forth by day, purified after death, according to the desire<br>
  of his heart. Now if this Chapter be recited over him, he shall<br>
  progress over the earth, and he shall escape from every fire, and none<br>
  of the evil things which appertain to him shall ever be round about<br>
  him; never, a million times over, shall this be.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF OPENING THE MOUTH OF THE OSIRIS ANI. To be said:- The<br>
  god Ptah shall open my mouth, and the god of my town shall unfasten<br>
  the swathings, the swathings which are over my mouth. Thereupon<br>
  shall come Thoth, who is equipped with words of power in great<br>
  abundance, and shall untie the fetters, even the fetters of the god<br>
  Set which are over my mouth. And the god Tem shall cast them back at<br>
  those who would fetter me with them, and cast them at him. Then<br>
  shall the god Shu open my mouth, and make an opening into my mouth<br>
  with the same iron implement wherewith he opened the mouth of the<br>
  gods. I am the goddess Sekhmet, and I take my seat upon the place by<br>
  the side of Amt-ur the great wind of heaven. I am the great<br>
  Star-goddess Saah, who dwelleth among the Souls of Anu. Now as<br>
  concerning every spell, and every word which shall be spoken against<br>
  me, every god of the Divine Company shall set himself in opposition<br>
  thereto.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF BRINGING WORDS OF POWER TO THE OSIRIS ANI, who<br>
  saith:- I am Tem-Khepera who produced himself on the thighs of his<br>
  divine mother. Those who dwell in Nu have been made wolves, and those<br>
  who are among the Tchatcha Chiefs have become hyenas. Behold, I will<br>
  gather together to myself this charm from the person with whom it is<br>
  [and from the place] wherein it is [and it shall come to me] quicker<br>
  than a greyhound, and swifter that light. Hail, thou who bringest the<br>
  Ferry-Boat of Ra, thou holdest thy course firmly and directly in the<br>
  north wind as thou sailest up the river towards the Island of Fire<br>
  which is in Khert-Neter. Behold, thou shalt gather together to thee<br>
  this charm from wheresoever it may be, and from whomsoever it may be<br>
  with [and it shall come to me] quicker than a greyhound, and swifter<br>
  than light. It (the charm) made the transformations of Mut; it<br>
  fashioned the gods [or] kept them silent; by it Mut gave the warmth<br>
  [of life] to the gods. Behold, these words of power are mine, and<br>
  they shall come unto me from wheresoever they may be, or with<br>
  whomsoever they may be, quicker than greyhounds and swifter than<br>
  light, or, according to another reading, &quot;swifter than shadows.&quot;<br>
  APPENDIX</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER WHICH MAKETH A MAN TO REMEMBER HIS NAME IN<br>
  KHERT-NETER. [The deceased] saith:- Let my name be given to me in<br>
  the Great House (Per-ur), and let me remember my name in the House<br>
  of Fire (Per Neser), on the night wherein the years are counted up,<br>
  and the number of the months is told. I am dwelling with the Divine<br>
  One, I take my seat on the eastern side of the sky. If any god<br>
  cometh after me, I shall be able to declare his name forthwith.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF GIVING A HEART TO THE OSIRIS ANI IN KHERT-NETER. He<br>
  saith:- Let my heart be with me in the House of Hearts. Let my<br>
  heart-case be with me in the House of heart-cases. Let my heart be<br>
  with me, and let it rest in [me or] I shall not eat the cakes of<br>
  Osiris in the eastern side of the Lake of Flowers, nor have a boat<br>
  wherein to float down the river, nor a boat to sail up the river to<br>
  thee, nor be able to embark in a boat with thee. Let my mouth be to me<br>
  that I may speak therewith. Let my legs be to me that I may walk<br>
  therewith. Let my arms be to me that I may overthrow the foe<br>
  therewith. Let the two doors of the sky be opened to me. May Keb,<br>
  the Erpat of the gods, open his jaws to me. May he open my two eyes<br>
  which are blinded by swathings. May he make me to lift up my legs in<br>
  walking which are tied together. May Anpu make my thighs to become<br>
  vigorous. May the goddess Sekhmet raise me, and lift me up. Let me<br>
  ascend into heaven, let that which I command be performed in<br>
  Het-ka-Ptah. I know how to use my heart. I am master of my heart-case.<br>
  I am master of my hands and arms. I am master of my legs. I have the<br>
  power to do that which my KA desireth to do. My Heart-soul shall not<br>
  be kept a prisoner in my body at the gates of Amentet when I would<br>
  go in in peace and come forth in peace.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART OF THE OSIRIS, THE ASSESSOR<br>
  OF THE DIVINE OFFERINGS OF ALL THE GODS, ANI, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH<br>
  BEFORE OSIRIS, BE DRIVEN BACK FROM HIM IN KHERT-NETER. He saith:- My<br>
  heart of my mother. My heart of my mother. My heart-case of my<br>
  transformations. Let not any one stand up to bear testimony against<br>
  me. Let no one drive me away from the Tchatcha Chiefs. Let no one make<br>
  thee to fall away from me in the presence of the Keeper of the<br>
  Balance. Thou art my KA, the dweller in my body, the god Khnemu who<br>
  makest sound my members. Mayest thou appear in the place of<br>
  happiness whither we go. Let not make my name to stink Shenit<br>
  Chiefs, who make men to be stable. [Let it be satisfactory unto us,<br>
  and let the listening be satisfactory unto us, and let there be joy of<br>
  heart to us at the weighing of words. Let not lies be told against<br>
  me before the Great God, the Lord of Amentet. Verily, how great<br>
  shalt thou be when thou risest up in triumph!]</p>
<p>RUBRIC I: These words are to be said over a scarab of green stone<br>
  encircled with a band of refined copper, and [having] a ring of<br>
  silver; which shall be placed on the neck of the Khu (the deceased),<br>
  etc.<br>
  RUBRIC II (From the Papyrus of Nu, Sheet 21): If this Chapter be<br>
  known [by the deceased] he shall be declared a speaker of the truth<br>
  both upon earth and in Khert-Neter, and he shall be able to perform<br>
  every act which a living human being can perform. Now it is a great<br>
  protection which hath been given by the god. This Chapter was found in<br>
  the city of Khemenu upon the slab of ba, which was inlaid with<br>
  [letters of] genuine lapis-lazuli, and was under the feet of [the<br>
  statue] of the god, during the reign of His Majesty, the King of the<br>
  South and North, Menkaura (Mycerinus), true of word, by Prince<br>
  Herutataf, who found it during a journey which he made to inspect<br>
  the temples. One Nekht was with him who was diligent in making him<br>
  to understand it, and he brought it to the king as a wonderful<br>
  object when he perceived that it was a thing of great mystery, [the<br>
  like of] which had never [before] been seen or looked upon. This<br>
  Chapter shall be recited by a man who is ceremonially clean and<br>
  pure, who hath not eaten the flesh of animals, or fish, and who hath<br>
  not had intercourse with women. And behold, thou shalt make a scarab<br>
  of green stone, with a rim [plated] with gold, which shall be placed<br>
  above the heart of a man, and it shall perform for him the &quot;opening of<br>
  the mouth.&quot; And thou shalt anoint it with myrrh unguent, and thou<br>
  shalt recite over it the following words of magical power. [Here<br>
  follows the text of the Chapter of Not Letting the Heart of Ani Be<br>
  Taken from Him.]</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART-SOUL OF A MAN BE SNATCHED<br>
  AWAY FROM HIM IN KHERT-NETER. The Osiris the scribe Ani saith:--I,<br>
  even I, am he who cometh forth from the Celestial Water (Akeb). He<br>
  (Akeb) produced abundance for me, and hath the mastery there in the<br>
  form of the River.</p>

  appendix.)<br>

  (The following is from the Papyrus of Nefer-uben-f, Naville, op.<br>

<p>THE CHAPTER OF DRINKING WATER IN KHERT-NETER. The am khent priest,<br>
  Nefer-uben-f, whose word is truth, saith:- I, even I, am he who cometh<br>
  forth from the god Keb. The water-flood is given to him, he hath<br>
  become the master thereof in the form of Hapi. I, the am khent<br>
  Nefer-uben-f, open the doors of heaven. Thoth hath opened to me the<br>
  doors of Qebh (the Celestial Waters). Lo, Hepi Hepi, the two sons of<br>
  the Sky, mighty in splendour, grant ye that I may be master over the<br>
  water, even as Set had dominion over his evil power on the day of<br>
  the storming of the Two Lands. I pass by the Great Ones, arm to<br>
  shoulder, even as they pass that Great God, the Spirit who is<br>
  equipped, whose name is unknown. I have passed by the Aged One of<br>
  the shoulder. I am Nefer-uben-f, whose word is truth. Hath opened to<br>
  me the Celestial Water Osiris. Hath opened to me the Celestial Water<br>
  Thoth-Hapi, the Lord of the horizon, in his name of &quot;Thoth, cleaver of<br>
  the earth.&quot; I am master of the water, as Set is master of his<br>
  weapon. I sail over the sky, I am Ra, I am Ru. I am Sma. I have<br>
  eaten the Thigh, I have seized the bone and flesh. I go round about<br>
  the Lake of Sekhet-Ar. Hath been given to me eternity without limit.<br>
  Behold, I am the heir of eternity, to whom hath been given<br>
  everlastingness.</p>

  (The following two Chapters are from the Papyrus of Nu, Sheets 7 and<br>
  12)</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF DRINKING WATER AND OF NOT BEING BURNT UP BY FIRE<br>
  [IN KHERT-NETER]. Nu saith:- Hail, Bull of Amentet! I am brought<br>
  unto thee. I am the paddle of Ra wherewith he transported the Aged<br>
  Gods. Let me neither be burnt up nor destroyed by fire. I am Beb,<br>
  the firstborn son of Osiris, to whom every god maketh an offering in<br>
  the temple of his Eye in Anu. I am the divine Heir, the Mighty One,<br>
  the Great One, the Resting One. I have made my name to flourish.<br>
  Deliverer, thou livest in me [every day].</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT BEING BOILED IN FIRE. Nu saith:- I am the<br>
  paddle which is equipped, wherewith Ra transported the Aged Gods,<br>
  which raised up the emissions of Osiris from the Lake of blazing fire,<br>
  and he was not burned. I sit down like the Light-god, and like Khnemu,<br>
  the Governor of lions. Come, cut away the fetters from him that<br>
  passeth by the side of this path, and let me come forth therefrom.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF GIVING AIR IN KHERT-NETER. The Osiris Ani saith:- I<br>
  am the Egg which dwelt in the Great Cackler. I keep ward over that<br>
  great place which Keb hath proclaimed upon earth. I live; it liveth. I<br>
  grow up, I live, I snuff the air. I am Utcha-aab. I go round about his<br>
  egg [to protect it]. I have thwarted the moment of Set. Hail, Sweet<br>
  one of the Two Lands! Hail, dweller in the tchefa food! Hail,<br>
  dweller in the lapis-lazuli! Watch ye over him that is in his<br>
  cradle, the Babe when he cometh forth to you.<br>

  thou God Temu, grant thou unto me the sweet breath which dwelleth in<br>
  thy nostrils! I am the Egg which is in Kenken-ur (the Great<br>
  Cackler), and I watch and guard that mighty thing which hath come into<br>
  being, wherewith the god Keb hath opened the earth. I live; it liveth;<br>
  I grow, I live, I snuff the air. I am the god Utcha-aabet, and I go<br>
  about his egg. I shine at the moment of the mighty of strength,<br>
  Suti. Hail, thou who makest sweet the time of the Two Lands! Hail,<br>
  dweller among the celestial food. Hail, dweller among the beings of<br>
  blue (lapis-lazuli), watch ye to protect him that is in his nest,<br>
  the Child who cometh forth to you.</p>

  THE CHAPTER OF GIVING AIR IN KHERT-NETER. Nu saith:- I am the jackal<br>
  of jackals. I am Shu. I draw air from the presence of the Light-god,<br>
  from the uttermost limits of heaven, from the uttermost limits of<br>
  earth, from the uttermost limits of the pinion of Nebeh bird. May<br>
  air be given unto this young divine Babe. [My mouth is open, I see<br>

  THE CHAPTER OF SNUFFING THE AIR WITH WATER IN KHERT-NETER. Hail,<br>
  Tem. Grant thou unto me the sweet breath which dwelleth in thy<br>

  of Unu. I keep watch over the Egg of Kenken-ur (the Great Cackler).<br>
  I grow and flourish as it groweth and flourisheth. I live as it<br>
  liveth. I snuff the air as it snuffeth the air.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART OF A MAN BE SNATCHED AWAY<br>
  FROM HIM IN KHERT-NETER. The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth,<br>
  saith:- Get thee back, O messenger of every god! Art thou come to<br>
  [snatch away] my heart-case which liveth? My heart-case which liveth<br>
  shall not be given unto thee. [As] I advance, the gods hearken unto my<br>

<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT ALLOWING THE HEART.... TO BE CARRIED AWAY DEAD IN<br>
  KHERT-NETER. [Nu, whose word is truth, saith]:- My heart is with me,<br>
  and it shall never come to pass that it be carried away. I am the Lord<br>
  of Hearts, the slayer of the heart-case. I live in truth, I have my<br>
  being therein. I am Horus, the Dweller in Hearts, [I am] in the<br>
  Dweller in the body. I have life by my word, my heart hath being. My<br>
  heart-case shall not be snatched away from me, it shall not be<br>
  wounded, it shall not be put in restraint if wounds are inflicted upon<br>
  me. [If] one take possession of it I shall have my being in the body<br>
  of my father Keb and in the body of my mother Nut. I have not done<br>
  that which is held in abomination by the gods. I shall not suffer<br>
  defeat [for] my word is truth.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART-CASE OF A MAN BE TAKEN AWAY<br>
  FROM HIM IN KHERT-NETER. The Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, ye who steal and<br>
  crush heart-cases [and who make the heart of a man to go through its<br>
  transformations according to his deeds: let not what he hath done harm<br>
  him before you]. Homage to you, O ye Lords of Eternity, ye masters<br>
  of everlastingness, take ye not this heart of Osiris Ani into your<br>
  fingers, and this heart-case, and cause ye not things of evil to<br>
  spring up against it, because this heart belongeth to the Osiris<br>
  Ani, and this heart-case belongeth to him of the great names<br>
  (Thoth), the mighty one, whose words are his members. He sendeth his<br>
  heart to rule his body, and his heart is renewed before the gods.<br>
  The heart of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, is to him; he hath<br>
  gained the mastery over it. He hath not said what he hath done. He<br>
  hath obtained power over his own members. His heart obeyeth him, he is<br>
  the lord thereof, it is in his body, and it shall never fall away<br>
  therefrom. I command thee to be obedient unto me in Khert-Neter. I,<br>
  the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, in peace; whose word is truth<br>
  in the Beautiful Amentet, by the Domain of Eternity.<br>

  (From the Papyrus of Nu, Sheet 5)</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART OF NU, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH,<br>
  BE CARRIED AWAY FROM HIM IN KHERT-NETER. He saith:- Hail, thou<br>
  Lion-god! I am Unb (the Blossom). That which is held in abomination to<br>
  me is the block of slaughter of the god. Let not this my heart-case be<br>
  carried away from me by the Fighting Gods in Anu. Hail, thou who<br>
  dost wind bandages round Osiris, and who hast seen Set. Hail, thou who<br>
  returnest after smiting and destroying him before the mighty ones!<br>
  This my heart weepeth over itself before Osiris; it hath made<br>
  supplication for me. I have given unto him and I have dedicated unto<br>
  him the thoughts of the heart in the House of the god (Usekh-her),<br>
  have brought unto him sand at the entry to Khemenu. Let not this my<br>
  heart-case be carried away from me. I make you to ascend his throne,<br>
  to fetter heart-cases for him in Sekhet-hetep, [to live] years of<br>
  strength away from things of all kinds which are abominations to<br>
  him, to carry off food from among the things which are thine, and<br>
  which are in thy grasp through thy strength. And this my heart-case is<br>
  devoted to the decrees of the god Tem, who guideth me through the<br>
  caverns of Suti, but let not this my heart, which hath performed its<br>
  desire before the Tchatcha Chiefs who are in Khert-Neter, be given<br>
  to him. When they find the leg and the swathings they bury them.</p>
<p><br>
  THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART OF NU, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH,<br>
  BE DRIVEN AWAY FROM HIM IN KHERT-NETER. He saith:- My heart of my<br>
  mother. My heart of my mother. My heart-case of my existence upon<br>
  the earth. Let no one stand up against me when I bear testimony in the<br>
  presence of the Lords of Things. Let it not be said against me and<br>
  of that which I have done &quot;He hath committed acts which are opposed to<br>
  what is right and true,&quot; and let not charges be brought up against<br>
  me in the presence of the Great God, the Lord of Amentet. Homage to<br>
  thee, O my heart (ab). Homage to thee, O my heart-case. Homage to you,<br>
  O my reins. Homage to you, O ye gods, who are masters of [your]<br>
  beards, and who are holy by reason of your sceptres. Speak ye for me<br>
  words of good import to Ra, and make ye me to have favour in the sight<br>
  of Nehebkau.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF BREATHING THE AIR AND OF HAVING POWER OVER WATER IN<br>
  KHERT-NETER. The Osiris Ani saith:- Open to me! Who art thou?<br>
  Whither goest thou? What is thy name? I am one of you. Who are these<br>
  with you? The two Merti goddesses (Isis and Nephthys). Thou separatest<br>
  head from head when [he] entereth the divine Mesqen chamber. He<br>
  causeth me to set out for the temple of the gods Kem-heru.<br>
  &quot;Assembler of souls&quot; is the name of my ferry-boat. &quot;Those who 
  make the<br>
  hair to bristle&quot; is the name of the oars. &quot;Sert&quot; (&quot;Goad&quot;) 
  is the<br>
  name of the hold. &quot;Steering straight in the middle&quot; is the name of 
  the<br>
  rudder; likewise, [the boat] is a type of my being borne onward in the<br>
  lake. Let there be given unto me vessels of milk, and cakes, and<br>
  loaves of bread, and cups of drink, and flesh, in the Temple of Anpu.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: If the deceased knoweth this Chapter, he shall go into,<br>
  after coming forth from Khert-Neter of [the Beautiful Amentet].</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF SNUFFING THE AIR, AND OF HAVING POWER OVER THE<br>
  WATER IN KHERT-NETER. The Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, thou Sycamore<br>
  tree of the goddess Nut! Give me of the [water and of the] air which<br>
  is in thee. I embrace that throne which is in Unu, and I keep guard<br>
  over the Egg of Nekek-ur. It flourisheth, and I flourish; it liveth,<br>
  and I live; it snuffeth the air, and I snuff the air, I the Osiris<br>
  Ani, whose word is truth, in [peace].</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT DYING A SECOND TIME IN KHERT-NETER. The Osiris<br>
  Ani saith:- My hiding place is opened, my hiding place is opened.<br>
  The Spirits fall headlong in the darkness, but the Eye of Horus hath<br>
  made me holy, and Upuati hath nursed me. I will hide myself among you,<br>
  O ye stars which are imperishable. My brow is like the brow of Ra.<br>
  My face is open. My heart-case is upon its throne, I know how to utter<br>
  words. In very truth I am Ra himself. I am not a man of no account.<br>
  I am not a man to whom violence can be done. Thy father liveth for<br>
  thee, O son of Nut. I am thy son, O great one, I have seen the<br>
  hidden things which are thine. I am crowned upon my throne like the<br>
  king of the gods. I shall not die a second time in Khert-Neter.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT ROTTING IN KHERT-NETER. The Osiris Ani saith:-<br>
  O thou who art motionless, O thou who art motionless, O thou whose<br>
  members are motionless, like unto those of Osiris. Thy members shall<br>
  not be motionless, they shall not rot, they shall not crumble away,<br>
  they shall not fall into decay. My members shall be made [permanent]<br>
  for me as if I were Osiris.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: If this Chapter be known by the deceased he shall never<br>
  see corruption in Khert-Neter.<br>

  APPENDIX<br>
  (From the Papyrus of Nu, Sheet 18)</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE BODY PERISH. The Osiris Nu saith:-<br>
  Homage to thee, O my divine father Osiris! I come to embalm thee. Do<br>
  thou embalm these my members, for I would not perish and come to an<br>
  end [but would be] even like unto my divine father Khepera, the divine<br>
  type of him that never saw corruption. Come then, strengthen my<br>
  breath, O Lord of the winds, who dost magnify these divine beings<br>
  who are like unto thyself. Stablish me, stablish me, and fashion me<br>
  strongly, O Lord of the funeral chest. Grant thou that I may enter<br>
  into the land of everlastingness, according to that which was done for<br>
  thee, along with thy father Tem, whose body never saw corruption,<br>
  and who himself never saw corruption. I have never done that which<br>
  thou hatest, nay, I have acclaimed thee among those who love thy KA.<br>
  Let not my body become worms, but deliver thou me as thou didst<br>
  deliver thyself. I pray thee, let me not fall into rottenness, as thou<br>
  lettest every god, and every goddess, and every animal, and every<br>
  reptile, see corruption, when the soul hath gone out of them, after<br>
  their death.<br>
  And when the soul hath departed, a man seeth corruption, and the<br>
  bones of his body crumble away and become stinking things, and the<br>
  members decay one after the other, the bones crumble into a helpless<br>
  mass, and the flesh turneth into foetid liquid. Thus man becometh a<br>
  brother unto the decay which cometh upon him, and he turneth into a<br>
  myriad of worms, and he becometh nothing but worms, and an end is made<br>
  of him, and perisheth in the sight of the god of day (Shu), even as do<br>
  every god, and every goddess, and every bird, and every fish, and<br>
  every creeping worm, and every reptile, and every beast, and every<br>
  thing whatsoever. Let [all the Spirits fall] on their bellies [when]<br>
  they recognize me, and behold, the fear of me shall terrify them;<br>
  and thus also let it be with every being that hath died, whether it be<br>
  animal, or bird, or fish, or worm, or reptile. Let life [rise out<br>
  of] death. Let not the decay caused by any reptile make an end [of<br>
  me], and let not [enemies] come against me in their various forms.<br>
  Give thou me not over to the Slaughterer in this execution-chamber,<br>
  who killeth the members, and maketh them rot, being [himself]<br>
  invisible, and who destroyeth the bodies of the dead, and liveth by<br>
  carnage. Let me live, and perform his order; I will do what is<br>
  commanded by him. Give me not over to his fingers, let him not<br>
  overcome me, for I am under thy command, O Lord of the Gods.<br>
  Homage to thee, O my divine father Osiris, thou livest with thy<br>
  members. Thou didst not decay, thou didst not become worms, thou didst<br>
  not wither, thou didst not rot, thou didst not putrefy, thou didst not<br>
  turn into worms. I am the god Khepera, and my members shall have being<br>
  everlastingly. I shall not decay, I shall not rot, I shall not<br>
  putrefy, I shall not turn into worms, and I shall not see corruption<br>
  before the eye of the god Shu. I shall have my being, I shall have<br>
  by being; I shall live, I shall live; I shall flourish, I shall<br>
  flourish, I shall flourish, I shall wake up in peace, I shall not<br>
  putrefy, my intestines shall not perish, I shall not suffer injury. My<br>
  eye shall not decay. The form of my face shall not disappear. My ear<br>
  shall not become deaf. My head shall not be separated from my neck. My<br>
  tongue shall not be removed. My hair shall not be cut off. My eyebrows<br>
  shall not be shaved away, and no evil defect shall assail me. My<br>
  body shall be stablished. It shall neither become a ruin, nor be<br>
  destroyed on this earth.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT PERISHING AND OF BEING ALIVE IN KHERT-NETER.<br>
  The Osiris Ani saith:- Hail ye children of the god Shu. The Tuat<br>
  hath gained the mastery over his diadem. Among the Hamemet Spirits may<br>
  I arise, even as did arise Osiris.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT GOING IN TO THE BLOCK OF THE GOD. The Osiris<br>
  Ani saith:- My head was fastened on my body in heaven, O Guardian of<br>
  the Earth, by Ra. [This] was granted [to me] on the day of my being<br>
  stablished, when I rose up out of a state of weakness upon [my] two<br>
  feet. On the day of cutting off the hair Set and the Company of the<br>
  Gods fastened my head to my neck, and it became as firm as it was<br>
  originally. Let nothing happen to shake it off again! Make ye me<br>
  safe from the murderer of my father. I have tied together the Two<br>
  Earths. Nut hath fastened together the vertebrae of my neck, and [I]<br>
  behold them as they were originally, and they are seen in the order<br>
  wherein they were when as yet Maat was not seen, and when the gods<br>
  were not born in visible forms. I am Penti. I am the heir of the great<br>
  gods, I the Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT BEING TRANSPORTED TO THE EAST IN KHERT-NETER. The<br>
  Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, Phallus of Ra, which advanceth and beateth<br>
  down opposition. Things which have been without motion for millions of<br>
  years have come into life through Baba. I am stronger thereby than the<br>
  strong, and I have more power thereby than the mighty. Now, let me not<br>
  be carried away in a boat, or be seized violently and taken to the<br>
  East, to have the festivals of Sebau Devils celebrated on me. Let<br>
  not deadly wounds be inflicted upon me, and let me not be gored by<br>
  horns. Thou shalt neither fall [nor] eat fish made by Tebun.</p>
<p>Now, no evil thing of any kind whatsoever shall be done unto me by<br>
  the Sebau Devils. [I shall not be gored by] horns. Therefore the<br>
  Phallus of Ra, [which is] the head of Osiris, shall not be swallowed<br>
  up. Behold, I shall come into me fields and I shall cut the grain. The<br>
  gods shall provide me with food. Thou shalt not then be gored,<br>
  Ra-Khepera. There shall not be then pus in the Eye of Tem, and it<br>
  shall not be destroyed. Violence shall not be done unto me, and I<br>
  shall not be carried away in [my] boat to the East to have the<br>
  festivals of the Sebau Devils celebrated on me in evil fashion.<br>
  Cruel gashes with knives shall not be inflicted upon me, and I shall<br>
  not be carried away in [my] boat to the East. I the Osiris, the<br>
  assessor of the holy offerings of all the gods, Ani, whose word is<br>
  truth, happily, the lord of fealty [to Osiris].</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEAD OF A MAN BE CUT OFF FROM HIS<br>
  BODY IN KHERT-NETER. The Osiris Ani saith:- I am a Great One, the<br>
  son of a Great One. [I am] Fire, the son of Fire, to whom was given<br>
  his head after it had been cut off. The head of Osiris was not removed<br>
  from his body, and the head of Osiris Ani shall not be removed from<br>
  his body. I have knitted myself together, I have made myself whole and<br>
  complete. I shall renew my youth. I am Osiris Himself, the Lord of<br>
  Eternity.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF MAKING THE SOUL TO BE JOINED TO ITS BODY IN<br>
  KHERT-NETER. The Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, thou god Aniu! Hail, thou<br>
  god Pehreri, who dwellest in thy hall, the Great God. Grant thou<br>
  that my soul may come to me from any place wherein it may be. Even<br>
  if it would tarry, let my soul be brought unto me from any place<br>
  wherein it may be. Thou findest the Eye of Horus standing by thee like<br>
  unto those beings who resemble Osiris, who never lie down in death.<br>
  Let not the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, lie down dead among those<br>
  who lie in Anu, the land wherein [souls] are joined to their bodies in<br>
  thousands. Let me have possession of my Ba-soul and of my Spirit-soul,<br>
  and let my word be truth with it (the Ba-soul) in every place<br>
  wherein it may be. Observe then, O ye guardians of Heaven, my soul<br>
  [wherever it may be]. Even if it would tarry, cause thou my Ba-soul to<br>
  see my body. Thou shalt find the Eye of Horus standing by thee like<br>
  [the Watchers].<br>
  Hail, ye gods who tow along the boat of the Lord of Millions of<br>
  Years, who bring it over the sky of the Tuat, who make it to journey<br>
  over Nent, who make Ba-souls to enter into their Spirit-bodies,<br>
  whose hands hold the steering poles and guide it straight, who grasp<br>
  tightly your paddles, destroy ye the Enemy; thus shall the Boat<br>
  rejoice, and the Great God shall travel on his way in peace. Moreover,<br>
  grant ye that the Ba-soul of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth<br>
  before the gods, may come forth with your navel cords in the eastern<br>
  part of the sky, and that it may follow Ra to the place where he was<br>
  yesterday, and may set in peace, in peace in Amentet. May it gaze upon<br>
  its earthly body, may it take up its abode and its Spirit-body, may it<br>
  neither perish nor be destroyed for ever and for ever.</p>

  of gold, and inlaid with precious stones, which shall be placed on the<br>
  breast of the Osiris.</p>
<p><br>
  THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE SOUL OF A MAN BE HELD CAPTIVE IN<br>
  KHERT-NETER. The Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, thou who art exalted!<br>
  Hail, thou who art adored! Hail, Mighty One of Souls, thou divine Soul<br>
  who inspirest great dread, who dost set the fear of thyself in the<br>
  gods, who are enthroned upon thy mighty seat. Make thou a path for the<br>
  Spirit-soul and the Ba-soul of the Osiris Ani. I am equipped with<br>
  [words of power]. I am a Spirit-soul equipped with [words of power]. I<br>
  have made my way to the place where are Ra and Hathor.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: If this Chapter be known by the deceased he shall be able to<br>
  transform himself into a Spirit-soul who shall be equipped with [his<br>
  soul and his shadow] in Khert-Neter, and he shall not be shut up<br>
  inside any door in Amentet, when he is coming forth upon the Earth, or<br>
  when he is going back into [Khert-Neter.]</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF OPENING THE TOMB TO THE BA-SOUL AND THE SHADOW, AND<br>
  OF COMING FORTH BY DAY, AND OF HAVING MASTERY OVER THE TWO LEGS. The<br>
  Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- The place which is<br>
  closed is opened, the place which is shut (or sealed) is sealed.<br>
  That which lieth down in the closed place is opened by the Ba-soul<br>
  which is in it. By the Eye of Horus I am delivered. Ornaments are<br>
  stablished on the brow of Ra. My stride is made long. I lift up my two<br>
  thighs [in walking]. I have journeyed over a long road. My limbs are<br>
  in a flourishing condition. I am Horus, the Avenger of his Father, and<br>
  I bring the Urrt Crown [and set it on] its standard. The road of souls<br>
  is opened. My twin soul seeth the Great God in the Boat of Ra, on<br>
  the day of souls. My soul is in the front thereof with the counter<br>
  of the years. Come, the Eye of Horus hath delivered for me my soul, my<br>
  ornaments are stablished on the brow of Ra. Light is on the faces of<br>
  those who are in the members of Osiris. Ye shall not hold captive my<br>
  soul. Ye shall not keep in durance my shadow. The way is open to my<br>
  soul and to my shadow. It seeth the Great God in the shrine on the day<br>
  of counting souls. It repeateth the words of Osiris. Those whose seats<br>
  are invisible, who fetter the members of Osiris, who fetter<br>
  Heart-souls and Spirit-souls, who set a seal upon the dead, and who<br>
  would do evil to me, shall do no evil to me. Haste on the way to me.<br>
  Thy heart is with thee. My Heart-soul and my Spirit-soul are equipped;<br>
  they guide thee. I sit down at the head of the great ones who are<br>
  chiefs of their abodes. The wardens of the members of Osiris shall not<br>
  hold thee captive, though they keep ward over souls, and set a seal on<br>
  the shadow which is dead. Heaven shall not shut thee in.</p>

  by day, and his soul shall not be kept captive.<br>

<p>That which was shut hath been opened [that is] the dead. That<br>
  which was shut fast hath been opened by the command of the Eye of<br>
  Horus, which hath delivered me. Established are the beauties on the<br>
  forehead of Ra. My steps are long. My legs are lifted up. I have<br>
  performed the journey, my members are mighty and are sound. I am<br>
  Horus, the Avenger of his Father. I am he who bringeth along his<br>
  father, and his mother, by means of his staff. The way shall be opened<br>
  to him that hath power over his feet, and he shall see the Great God<br>
  in the Boat of Ra, when souls are counted therein at the bows, and<br>
  when the years also are counted up. Grant that the Eye of Horus, which<br>
  maketh the adornments of splendour to be firm on the forehead of Ra,<br>
  may deliver my soul for me, and let darkness cover your faces, O ye<br>
  who would imprison Osiris. O keep not captive my soul. O keep not ward<br>
  over my shadow, but let a way be opened for my soul and my shadow, and<br>
  let them see the Great God in the shrine on the day of the counting of<br>
  souls, and let them hold converse with Osiris, whose habitations are<br>
  hidden, and those who guard the members of Osiris, and who keep ward<br>
  over the Spirit-souls, and who hold captive the shadows of the dead,<br>
  and who would work evil against me, so that they shall [not] work evil<br>
  against me. A way shall be for KA with thee, and thy soul shall be<br>
  prepared by those who keep ward over the members of Osiris, and who<br>
  hold captive the shadows of the dead. Heaven shall not keep thee fast,<br>
  the earth shall not hold thee captive. Thou shalt not live with the<br>
  beings who slay, but thou shalt be master of thy legs, and thou<br>
  shalt advance to thy body straightway in the earth, [and to] those who<br>
  belong to the shrine of Osiris and guard his members.</p>

  EARTH. The Osiris Ani saith:- Perform thy work, O Seker, perform thy<br>
  work, O Seker, O thou who dwellest in thy circle, and who dwellest<br>
  in my feet in Khert-Neter. I am he who sendeth forth light over the<br>
  Thigh of heaven. I come forth in heaven. I sit down by the Light-god<br>
  (Khu). O I am helpless. O I am helpless. I would walk. I am<br>
  helpless. I am helpless in the regions of those who plunder in<br>
  Khert-Neter, I the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, in peace.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF FORCING A WAY INTO AMENTET [AND OF COMING FORTH] BY<br>
  DAY. The Osiris Ani saith:- The town of Unu is opened. My head is<br>
  sealed up, Thoth. Perfect is the Eye of Horus. I have delivered the<br>
  Eye of Horus which shineth with splendours on the brow of Ra, the<br>
  Father of the gods, [I am] that self-same Osiris, [the dweller in]<br>
  Amentet. Osiris knoweth his day, and he knoweth that he shall live<br>
  through his period of life; I shall have by being with him. I am the<br>

  of terror. Behold, I have come unto thee. I see thee. I have forced<br>
  a way through the Tuat. I see my father Osiris. I drive away the<br>
  darkness. I love him. I have come. I see my father Osiris. He hath<br>
  counted the heart of Set. I have made offerings for my father<br>
  Osiris. I have opened all the ways in heaven and on earth. I love him.<br>
  I have come. I have become a Spirit-body and a Spirit-soul, who is<br>

  ANOTHER CHAPTER OF THE TUAT AND OF COMING FORTH BY DAY.</p>
<p>Open is the land of Unu. Shut is the head of Thoth. Perfect is the<br>
  Eye of Horus. I have delivered the Eye of Horus, the shining one,<br>
  the ornament of the Eye of Ra, the Father of the Gods. I am that<br>
  same Osiris who dwelleth in Amentet. Osiris knoweth his day, which<br>
  cometh to an end. I am Set, the Father of the Gods. I shall never come<br>
  to an end.</p>

  Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, thou One, who shinest from the moon. Hail,<br>

  which hath been spoken to the mariners at eventide, and the Osiris Nu,<br>
  whose word is truth, shall live after his death, even as doth Ra every<br>
  day. Behold, most certainly Ra was born yesterday, and the Osiris Nu<br>
  was born yesterday. And every god shall rejoice in the life of the<br>

  ENEMIES IN KHERT-NETER. [The Osiris Ani saith:-] I have divided the<br>
  heavens. I have cleft the horizon. I have traversed the earth<br>
  [following in] his footsteps. I have conquered the mighty Spirit-souls<br>
  because I am equipped for millions of years with words of power. I eat<br>

  over the road. I am Ra. I have come forth from the horizon against<br>
  my enemies. I have not permitted him to escape from me. I have<br>
  stretched out my hand like that of the Lord of the Urrt Crown. I<br>
  have lifted up my feet even as the Uraei-goddesses lift themselves up.<br>
  I have not permitted the enemy [to be saved] from me. As for mine<br>
  enemy, he hath been given to me, and he shall not be delivered from<br>
  me. I stand up like Horus. I sit down like Ptah. I am strong like<br>
  Thoth. I am mighty like Tem. I walk with my legs. I speak with my<br>
  mouth. I chase my enemy. He hath been given unto me, and he shall<br>
  not be delivered from me.</p>
<p>A HYMN OF PRAISE TO RA WHEN HE RISETH UPON THE HORIZON, AND WHEN<br>
  HE SETTETH IN THE LAND OF LIFE. Osiris the scribe Ani saith:- Homage<br>
  to thee, O Ra, when thou risest as Tem-Heru-Khuti. Thou art to be<br>
  adored. Thy beauties are before mine eyes, [thy] radiance is upon my<br>
  body. Thou goest forth to thy setting in the Sektet Boat with [fair]<br>
  winds, and thy heart is glad; the heart of the Matet Boat rejoiceth.<br>
  Thou stridest over the heavens in peace, and all thy foes are cast<br>
  down; the stars which never rest sing hymns of praise unto thee, and<br>
  the stars which are imperishable glorify thee as thou sinkest to<br>
  rest in the horizon of Manu, O thou who art beautiful at morn and at<br>
  eve, O thou lord who livest, and art established, O my Lord!<br>
  Homage to thee, O thou who art Ra when thou risest, and who art<br>
  Tem when thou settest in beauty. Thou risest and thou shinest on the<br>
  back of thy mother [Nut], O thou who art crowned the king of the gods!<br>
  Nut welcometh thee, and payeth homage unto thee, and Maat, the<br>
  everlasting and never-changing goddess, embraceth thee at noon and<br>
  at eve. Thou stridest over the heavens, being glad at heart, and the<br>
  Lake of Testes is content. The Sebau-fiend hath fallen to the<br>
  ground, his fore-legs and his hind-legs have been hacked off him,<br>
  and the knife hath severed the joints of his back. Ra hath a fair<br>
  wind, and the Sektet Boat setteth out on its journey, and saileth on<br>
  until it cometh into port. The gods of the South, the gods of the<br>
  North, the gods of the West, and the gods of the East praise thee, O<br>
  thou Divine Substance, from whom all living things came into being.<br>
  Thou didst send forth the word when the earth was submerged with<br>
  silence, O thou Only One, who didst dwell in heaven before ever the<br>
  earth and the mountains came into being. Hail, thou Runner, Lord, Only<br>
  One, thou maker of the things that are, thou hast fashioned the tongue<br>
  of the Company of the Gods, thou hast produced whatsoever cometh forth<br>
  from the waters, thou springest up out of them above the submerged<br>
  land of the Lake of Horus. Let me breathe the air which cometh forth<br>
  from thy nostrils, and the north wind which cometh forth from thy<br>
  mother Nut. Make thou my Spirit-soul to be glorious, O Osiris, make<br>
  thou my Heart-soul to be divine. Thou art worshipped as thou<br>
  settest, O Lord of the gods, thou art exalted by reason of thy<br>
  wondrous works. Shine thou with the rays of light upon my body day<br>
  by day, upon me, Osiris the scribe, the assessor of the divine<br>
  offerings of all the gods, the overseer of the granary of the Lords of<br>
  Abydos, the real royal scribe who loveth thee, Ani, whose word is<br>
  truth, in peace.<br>
  Praise be unto thee, O Osiris, the Lord of Eternity, Un-Nefer,<br>
  Heru-Khuti (Harmakhis), whose forms are manifold, whose attributes are<br>
  majestic [Praise be unto thee], O thou who art Ptah-Seker-Tem in<br>
  Anu, thou Lord of the hidden shrine, thou Creator of the House of<br>
  the KA of Ptah (Het-ka-Ptah) and of the gods [therein], thou Guide<br>
  of the Tuat, who art glorified when thou settest in Nu (the Sky). Isis<br>
  embraceth thee in peace, and she driveth away the fiends from the<br>
  entrances of thy paths. Thou turnest thy face towards Amentet, and<br>
  thou makest the earth to shine as with refined copper. Those who<br>
  have lain down in death rise up to see thee, they breathe the air, and<br>
  they look upon thy face when the disk riseth on the horizon. Their<br>
  hearts are at peace since they behold thee, o thou who art Eternity<br>
  and Everlastingness.<br>
  THE SOLAR LITANY</p>
<p>Homage to you, O ye gods of the Dekans in Anu, and to you, O ye<br>
  Hememet-spirits in Kher Aha, and to thee, O Unti, who art the most<br>
  glorious of all the gods who are hidden in Anu,<br>

  Crown is established, thou One who createst the strength to protect<br>
  thyself, and who dwellest in peace,<br>

  am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I<br>
  done aught with deceit.</p>
<p>Homage to thee, O Lord of the Acacia Tree, whose Seker Boat is set<br>
  upon its sledge, who turnest back the Fiend, the Evildoer, and dost<br>
  cause the Eye of Ra (utchat) to rest upon its seat,<br>
  O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass in peace, for I<br>
  am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I<br>
  done aught with deceit.</p>
<p>Homage to thee, O thou who art mighty in thine hour, thou great<br>
  and mighty Prince who dost dwell in Anrutef, thou Lord of Eternity and<br>
  Creator of the Everlastingness, thou Lord of Hensu,<br>
  O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass in peace, for I<br>
  am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I<br>
  done aught with deceit.</p>

  whose limbs form the substance of Ta-tchesert, unto whom fraud and<br>
  deceit are abominations,<br>
  O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass in peace, for I<br>
  am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I<br>
  done aught with deceit.</p>
<p>Homage to thee, O thou who dwellest in thy boat, who dost bring Hapi<br>
  (the Nile) forth from his cavern, whose body is the light, and who<br>
  dwellest in Nekhen,<br>
  O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass in peace, for I<br>
  am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I<br>
  done aught with deceit.</p>
<p>Homage to thee, O thou Creator of the gods, thou King of the South<br>
  and North, Osiris, whose word is truth, who rulest the world by thy<br>
  gracious goodness, thou Lord of the Atebui,<br>
  O grant thou unto me a path whereover I may pass in peace, for I<br>
  am just and true; I have not spoken falsehood wittingly, nor have I<br>

<p>A HYMN OF PRAISE TO RA WHEN HE RISETH IN THE EASTERN PART OF HEAVEN.<br>
  Those who are in his following rejoice, and the Osiris, the scribe<br>
  Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- Hail, thou Disk, thou lord of<br>
  rays, who risest on the horizon day by day. Shine thou with thy<br>
  beams of light upon the face of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth,<br>
  for he singeth hymns of praise to thee at dawn, and he maketh thee<br>
  to sit at eventide [with words of adoration]. May the soul of the<br>
  Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, come forth with thee into heaven! May<br>
  he set out with thee in the Matet Boat [in the morning], may he come<br>
  into port in the Sektet Boat [in the evening], and may he cleave his<br>
  path among the stars of heaven which never rest.<br>
  The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, being at peace [with his<br>
  god], maketh adoration to his Lord, the Lord of Eternity, and<br>
  saith:- Homage to thee, O Heru-khuti, who art the god Khepera, the<br>
  self-created. When thou risest on the horizon and sheddest thy beams<br>
  of light upon the Lands of the South and of the North, thou art<br>
  beautiful, yea beautiful, and all the gods rejoice when they behold<br>
  thee, the king of heaven. The goddess, the Lady of the Hour, is<br>
  stablished upon thy head, her Uraei of the South and of the North<br>
  are upon thy brow, and she taketh up her place before thee. The god<br>
  Thoth is stablished in the bows of thy boat to destroy utterly all thy<br>
  foes. Those who dwell in the Tuat come forth to meet thee, and they<br>
  bow to the earth in homage as they come towards thee, to look upon thy<br>
  beautiful Form. And I, Ani, have come into thy presence, so that I may<br>
  be with thee, and may behold thy Disk every day. Let me not be kept<br>
  captive [by the tomb], and let me not be turned back [on my way].<br>
  Let the members of my body be made new again when I contemplate thy<br>
  beauties, even as are the members of all thy favoured ones, because<br>
  I am one of those who worshipped thee upon earth. Let me arrive in the<br>
  Land of Eternity, let me enter into the Land of Everlastingness. This,<br>
  O my Lord, behold thou shalt ordain for me.<br>
  AND MOREOVER, THE OSIRIS ANI, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH, IN PEACE, THE<br>
  TRUTH-SPEAKER, SAITH:- Homage to thee, O thou who risest on thy<br>
  horizon in the form of Ra, who restest upon Law, [which can neither be<br>
  changed nor altered]. Thou passest over the sky, and every face,<br>
  watcheth thee and thy course, for thou thyself art hidden from their<br>
  gaze. Thou dost show thyself [to them] at dawn and at eventide each<br>
  day. The Sektet Boat, wherein Thy Majesty dwelleth, setteth forth on<br>
  its journey with vigour. Thy beams [fall] upon all faces, thy light<br>
  with its manifold colours is incomprehensible [to man], and thy<br>
  brilliant rays cannot be reported. The Lands of the Gods see thee,<br>
  they could write [concerning thee]; the Deserts of Punt could count<br>
  thee. Thy creation is hidden. It is one by the opening of thy mouth.<br>
  Thy form is the head of Nu. May he (Ani) advance, even as thou dost<br>
  advance, without cessation, even as Thy Majesty [ceaseth not to<br>
  advance] even for a moment. With great strides thou dost in one little<br>
  moment pass over limitless distances which would need millions and<br>
  hundreds of thousands of years [for a man to pass over; this] thou<br>
  doest, and then thou sinkest to rest. Thou bringest to an end the<br>
  hours of the night, even as thou stridest over them. Thou bringest<br>
  them to an end by thine own ordinance, and dawn cometh on the earth.<br>
  Thou settest thyself before thy handiwork in the form of Ra, and<br>
  thou rollest up on the horizon....... Thou sendest forth light when<br>
  thy form raiseth itself up, thou ordainest the increase of thy<br>
  splendours. Thou mouldest thy limbs as thou advancest, thou bringest<br>
  them forth, thou who wast never brought forth, in the form of Ra,<br>
  who rolleth up into the height of heaven. Grant thou that I may<br>
  reach the heaven of eternity, and the region where thy favoured ones<br>
  dwell. May I unite with those holy and perfect Spirit-souls of<br>
  Khert-Neter. May I come forth with them to behold thy beauties as thou<br>
  rollest on at eventide, as thou journeyest to thy mother Nut (the<br>
  Night-sky), and dost place thyself at the right hand (in the West). My<br>
  two hands are raised to thee in praise and thanksgiving when thou<br>
  settest in life. Behold, thou art the Creator of Eternity, who art<br>
  adored when thou settest in Nu. I have set thee in my heart, without<br>
  wavering, O thou who art more divine than the gods.<br>
  The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- Praise and thanksgiving<br>
  be unto thee, O thou who rollest on like unto gold, thou Illuminer<br>
  of the Two Lands on the day of thy birth. Thy mother brought thee<br>
  forth on her hand, and thou didst light up with splendour the circle<br>
  which is travelled over by the Disk. O Great Light who rollest<br>
  across Nu, thou dost raise up the generations of men from the deep<br>
  source of thy waters, and dost make to keep festivals all districts<br>
  and cities, and all habitations. Thou protectest [them] with thy<br>
  beauties. Thy KA riseth up with the celestial food hu and tchefau. O<br>
  thou mightily victorious one, thou Power of Powers, who makest<br>
  strong thy throne against the sinful ones, whose risings on thy throne<br>
  in the Sektet Boat are mighty, whose strength is widespread in the<br>
  Atett Boat, make thou the Osiris Ani to be glorious by virtue of his<br>
  word, which is truth, in Khert-Neter. Grant thou that he may be in<br>
  Amentet free from evil, and let [his] offences be [set] behind thee.<br>
  Grant thou that he may [live there] a devoted slave of the<br>
  Spirit-souls. Let him mingle among the Heart-souls who live in<br>
  Ta-tchesert (the Holy Land). Let him travel about in the Sekhet-Aaru<br>
  (the Elysian Fields), conformably to [thy] decree with joy of heart-<br>
  him the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth.<br>
  [And the god maketh answer]:--Thou shalt come forth into heaven,<br>
  thou shalt sail over the sky, and thou shalt hold loving intercourse<br>
  with the Star-gods. Praises shall be made to thee in the Boat. Thy<br>
  name shall be proclaimed in the Atett Boat. Thou shalt look upon Ra<br>
  within his shrine. Thou shalt make the Disk to set [with prayer] every<br>
  day. Thou shalt see the Ant Fish in his transformations in the<br>
  depths of the waters of turquoise. Thou shalt see the Abtu Fish in his<br>
  time. It shall be that the Evil One shall fall when he deviseth a plan<br>
  to destroy thee, and the joints of his neck and back shall be hacked<br>
  asunder. Ra saileth with a fair wind, and the Sektet Boat<br>
  progresseth and cometh into port. The mariners of Ra rejoice, and<br>
  the heart of the Lady of the Hour is glad, for the enemy of her Lord<br>
  hath been cast to the ground. Thou shalt behold Horus standing on<br>
  the pilot's place in the Boat, and Thoth and Maat shall stand one on<br>
  each side of him. All the gods shall rejoice when they behold Ra<br>
  coming in peace to make the hearts of the Spirit-souls to live, and<br>
  the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, the assessor of the holy<br>
  offerings of the Lords of Thebes, shall be with them!<br>
  THE CHAPTER OF THE NEW MOON</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING IS TO BE RECITED ON THE DAY OF THE MONTH (NEW MOON<br>
  DAY). The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, in peace,<br>
  whose word is truth, saith:- Ra ascendeth his throne on his horizon,<br>
  and the Company of his Gods follow in his train. The God cometh<br>
  forth from his hidden place, [and] tchefau food falleth from the<br>
  eastern horizon of heaven at the word of Nut. They (the gods)<br>
  rejoice over the paths of Ra, the Great Ancestor [as] he journeyeth<br>
  round about. Therefore art thou exalted, O Ra, the dweller in thy<br>
  Shrine. Thou swallowest the winds, thou drawest into thyself the north<br>
  wind, thou eatest up the flesh of thy seat on the day when thou<br>
  breathest truth. Thou dividest [it among] the gods who are [thy]<br>
  followers. [Thy] Boat saileth on travelling among the Great Gods at<br>
  thy word. Thou countest thy bones, thou gatherest together thy<br>
  members, thou settest thy face towards Beautiful Amentet, and thou<br>
  comest there, being made new every day. Behold, thou art that Image of<br>
  Gold, thou hast the unitings of the disks of the sky, thou hast<br>
  quakings, thou goest round about, and art made new each day. Hail!<br>
  There is rejoicing in the horizon! The gods who dwell in the sky<br>
  descend the ropes [of thy Boat] when they see the Osiris Ani, whose<br>
  word is truth, they ascribe praise unto him as unto Ra. The Osiris Ani<br>
  is a Great Chief. [He] seeketh the Urrt Crown. His provisions are<br>
  apportioned to him- the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth. [His] fate is<br>
  strong from the exalted body of the Aamu gods, who are in the presence<br>
  of Ra. The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, is strong on the earth and<br>
  in Khert-Neter. O Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, wake up, and be<br>
  strong like unto Ra every day. The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth,<br>
  shall not tarry, he shall not remain motionless in this land for ever.<br>
  Right well shall he see with his two eyes, right well shall he hear<br>
  with his two ears, the things which are true, the things which are<br>
  true. The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, is in Anu, the Osiris<br>
  Ani, whose word is truth, is as Ra, and he is exalted by reason of<br>
  [his] oars among the Followers of Nu. The Osiris Ani, whose word is<br>
  truth, cannot tell what he hath seen [or] narrate [what he hath heard]<br>
  in the House of the God of Mysteries. Hail! Let there be shouts of<br>
  acclamation of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, the divine body of<br>
  Ra in the Boat of Nu, who beareth propitiatory offerings for the KA of<br>
  the god of that which he loveth. The Osiris Ani, whose word is<br>
  truth, in peace, whose word is truth, is like Horus, the mighty one of<br>
  transformations.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: This Chapter is to be recited over a boat seven cubits long,<br>
  made of green stone of the Tchatchau. Make a heaven of stars, and<br>
  purify it and cleanse it with natron and incense. Make then a figure<br>
  of Ra upon a tablet of new stone in paint, and set it in the bows of<br>
  the boat. Then make a figure of the deceased whom thou wilt make<br>
  perfect, [and place it] in the boat. Make it to sail in the Boat of<br>
  Ra, and Ra himself shall look upon it. Do not these things in the<br>
  presence of any one except thyself, or thy father, or thy son. Then<br>
  let them keep guard over their faces, and they shall see the<br>
  deceased in Khert-Neter in the form of a messenger of Ra.</p>
<p>A HYMN TO RA [WHICH IS TO BE SUNG] ON THE DAY OF THE MONTH (THE<br>
  DAY OF THE NEW MOON) [WHEN] THE BOAT OF RA SAILETH. [The Osiris the<br>
  scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:-] Homage to thee, O thou who<br>
  dwellest in thy Boat. Thou rollest on, thou rollest on, thou sendest<br>
  forth light, thou sendest forth light. Thou decreest rejoicing for<br>
  [every] man for millions of years unto those who love him. Thou givest<br>
  [thy] face to the Hememet spirits, thou god Khepera who dwellest in<br>
  thy Boat. Thou hast overthrown the Fiend Aapep. O ye Sons of Keb,<br>
  overthrow ye the enemies of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, and<br>
  the fiends of destruction who would destroy the Boat of Ra. Horus hath<br>
  cut off your heads in heaven. Ye who were in the forms of geese,<br>
  your navel strings are on the earth. The animals are set upon the<br>
  earth..... in the form of fish. Every male fiend and every female<br>
  fiend shall be destroyed by the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth.<br>
  Whether the fiends descend from out of heaven, or whether they come<br>
  forth from the earth, or whether they advance on the waters, or<br>
  whether they come from among the Star-gods, Thoth, [the son of<br>
  Aner], coming forth from Anerti shall hack them to pieces. And the<br>
  Osiris Ani shall make them silent and dumb. And behold ye, this god,<br>
  the mighty one of slaughters, the terror of whom is most great,<br>
  shall wash himself clean in your blood, and he shall bathe in your<br>
  gore, and ye shall be destroyed by the Osiris Ani in the Boat of his<br>
  Lord Ra-Horus. The heart of the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, shall<br>
  live. His mother Isis giveth birth to him, and Nephthys nurseth him,<br>
  just as Isis gave birth to Horus, and Nephthys nursed him. [He]<br>
  shall repulse the Smait fiends of Suti. They shall see the Urrt<br>
  Crown stablished upon his head, and they shall fall down upon their<br>
  faces [and worship him]. Behold, O ye Spirit-souls, and men, and gods,<br>
  and ye dead, when ye see the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, in the<br>
  form of Horus, and the favoured one of the Urrt Crown, fall ye down<br>
  upon your faces. The word of the Osiris Ani is truth before his<br>
  enemies in heaven above, and on earth beneath, and before the<br>
  Tchatchau Chiefs of every god and of every goddess.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: This Chapter shall be recited over a large hawk standing<br>
  upright with the White Crown upon his head, [and over figures of] Tem,<br>
  Shu, Tefnut, Keb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, [Suti] and Nephthys. And they<br>
  shall be painted in colour upon a new tablet, which shall be placed in<br>
  a boat, together with a figure of the deceased. Anoint them with heken<br>
  oil, and offer unto them burning incense, and geese, and joints of<br>
  meat roasted. It is an act of praise to Ra as he journeyeth in his<br>
  boat, and it will make a man to have his being with Ra, and to<br>
  travel with him wheresoever he goeth, and it will most certainly cause<br>
  the enemies of Ra to be slain. And the Chapter of travelling shall<br>
  be recited on the sixth day of the festival.<br>
  APPENDIX<br>
  APPENDIX<br>
  (From the Turin Papyrus)</p>
<p>ANOTHER CHAPTER WHICH IS TO BE RECITED WHEN THE MOON RENEWETH ITSELF<br>
  ON THE DAY OF THE MONTH [WHEREON IT DOETH THIS]. Osiris unfettereth<br>
  the storm-cloud in the body of heaven, and is unfettered himself;<br>
  Horus is made strong happily each day. He whose transformations are<br>
  many hath had offerings made unto him at the moment, and he hath<br>
  made an end of the storm which is in the face of the Osiris, Auf-ankh,<br>
  whose word is truth. Verily, he cometh, and he is Ra in journeying,<br>
  and he is the four celestial gods in the heavens above. The Osiris<br>
  Auf-ankh, whose word is truth, cometh forth in his day, and he<br>
  embarketh among the tackle of the boat.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: If this Chapter be known by the deceased he shall become a<br>
  perfect Spirit-soul in Khert-Neter, and he shall not die a second<br>
  time, and he shall eat his food side by side with Osiris. If this<br>
  Chapter be known by the deceased upon earth, he shall become like unto<br>
  Thoth, and he shall be adored by those who live. He shall not fall<br>
  headlong at the moment of the intensity of the royal flame of the<br>
  goddess Bast, and the Great Prince shall make him to advance happily.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF ADVANCING TO THE TCHATCHAU CHIEFS OF OSIRIS. The<br>
  Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I have built a house for my<br>
  Ba-soul in the sanctuary in Tetu. I sow seed in the town of Pe (Buto).<br>
  I have ploughed the fields with my labourers. My palm tree [standeth<br>
  upright and is] like Menu upon it. I abominate abominable things. I<br>
  will not eat the things which are abominations unto me. What I<br>
  abominate is filth: I will not eat it. I shall not be destroyed by the<br>
  offerings of propitiation and the sepulchral meals. I will not<br>
  approach filth [to touch it] with my hands, I will not tread upon it<br>
  with my sandals. For my bread shall be made of the white barley, and<br>
  my ale shall be made from the red grain of the god Hapi (the<br>
  Nile-god), which the Sektet Boat and the Atett Boat shall bring<br>
  [unto me], and I will eat my food under the leaves of the trees<br>
  whose beautiful arms I myself do know. O what splendour shall the<br>
  White Crown make for me which shall be lifted up on me by the<br>
  Uraei-goddesses! O Doorkeeper of Sehetep-taui, bring thou to me that<br>
  wherewith the cakes of propitiation are made. Grant thou to me that<br>
  I may lift up the earth. May the Spirit-souls open to me [their] arms,<br>
  and let the Company of the Gods hold their peace whilst the Hememet<br>
  spirits hold converse with the Osiris Ani. May the hearts of the<br>
  gods lead him in his exalted state into heaven among the gods who<br>
  appear in visible forms. If any god, or any goddess, attack the Osiris<br>
  Ani, whose word is truth, when he setteth out, the Ancestor of the<br>
  year who liveth upon hearts [Osiris] shall eat him when he cometh<br>
  forth from Abydos, and the Ancestors of Ra shall reckon with him,<br>
  and the Ancestors of Light shall reckon with him. [He is] a god of<br>
  splendour [arrayed in] the apparel of heaven, and he is among the<br>
  Great Gods. Now the subsistence of the Osiris Ani, whose word is<br>
  truth, is among the cakes and the ale which are made for your<br>
  mouths. I enter in by the Disk, I come forth by the god Ahui. I<br>
  shall hold converse with the Followers of the Gods. I shall hold<br>
  converse with the Disk. I shall hold converse with the<br>
  Hememet-spirits. He shall set the terror of me in the thick<br>
  darkness, in the inside of the goddess Mehurt, by the side of his<br>
  forehead. Behold, I shall be with Osiris, and my perfection shall be<br>
  his perfection among the Great Gods. I shall speak unto him with the<br>
  words of men, I shall listen, and he shall repeat to me the words of<br>
  the gods. I, the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, in peace, have<br>
  come equipped. Thou makest to approach [thee] those who love thee. I<br>
  am a Spirit-soul who is better equipped than any [other] Spirit-soul.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO A SWALLOW. The<br>
  Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I am a swallow, [I am] a<br>
  swallow. [I am] that Scorpion, the daughter of Ra. Hail, O ye gods<br>
  whose odour is sweet. Hail, O ye gods whose odour is sweet. Hail,<br>
  Flame, who comest forth from the horizon. Hail, thou who art in the<br>
  city. I have brought the Warder of his corner there. Give me thy two<br>
  hands, and let me pass my time in the Island of Flame. I have advanced<br>
  with a message, I have come having the report thereof [to make].<br>
  Open to me. How shall I tell that which I have seen there? I am like<br>
  Horus, the governor of the Boat, when the throne of his father was<br>
  given unto him, and when Set, that son of Nut, was [lying] under the<br>
  fetters which he had made for Osiris. He who is in Sekhem hath<br>
  inspected me. I stretch out my arms over Osiris. I have advanced for<br>
  the examination, I have come to speak there. Let me pass on and<br>
  deliver my message. I am he who goeth in, [I am] judged, [I] come<br>
  forth magnified at the Gate of Nebertcher. I am purified at the<br>
  Great Uart. I have done away my wickednesses. I have put away<br>
  utterly my offences. I have put away utterly all the taints of evil<br>
  which appertained to me [upon the earth]. I have purified myself, I<br>
  have made myself to be like a god. Hail, O ye Doorkeepers, I have<br>
  completed my journey. I am like unto you. I have come forth by day.<br>
  I have advanced on my legs. I have gained the master over [my]<br>
  footsteps. [Hail, ye] Spirit-souls! I, even I, do know the hidden<br>

<p>[THE CHAPTER] OF MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO A HAWK OF GOLD.<br>
  The Osiris Ani saith:- I have risen up out of the seshett chamber,<br>
  like the golden hawk which cometh forth from his egg. I fly, I<br>
  alight like a hawk with a back of seven cubits, and the wings of which<br>
  are like unto the mother-of-emerald of the South. I have come forth<br>
  from the Sektet Boat, and my heart hath been brought unto me from<br>
  the mountain of the East. I have alighted on the Atet Boat, and<br>
  there have been brought unto me those who dwelt in their substance,<br>
  and they bowed in homage before me. I have risen, I have gathered<br>
  myself together like a beautiful golden hawk, with the head of the<br>
  Benu, and Ra hath entered in [to hear my speech]. I have taken my seat<br>
  among the great gods, [the children of] Nut. I have settled myself,<br>
  the Sekhet-hetepet (the Field of Offerings) is before me. I eat<br>
  therein, I become a Spirit-soul therein, I am supplied with food in<br>
  abundance therein, as much as I desire. The Grain-god (Nepra) hath<br>
  given unto me food for my throat, and I am master over myself and over<br>
  the attributes of my head.</p>
<p>[THE CHAPTER OF] MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO A DIVINE HAWK. The<br>
  Osiris Ani saith:- Hail, thou Great God, come thou to Tetu. Make<br>
  thou ready for me the ways, and let me go round [to visit] my thrones.<br>
  I have laboured. I have made myself perfect. O grant thou that I may<br>
  be held in fear. Create thou awe of me. Let the gods of the Tuat be<br>
  afraid of me, and let them fight for me in their halls. Permit not<br>
  thou to come nigh unto me him that would attack me, or would injure me<br>
  in the House of Darkness. Cover over the helpless one, hide him. Let<br>
  do likewise the gods who hearken unto the word [of truth], the Khepriu<br>
  gods who are in the following of Osiris. Hold ye your peace then, O ye<br>
  gods, whilst the God holdeth speech with me, he who listeneth to the<br>
  truth. I speak unto him my words. Osiris, grant thou that that which<br>
  cometh forth from thy mouth may circulate to me. Let me see thine<br>
  own Form. Let thy Souls envelop me. Grant thou that I may come<br>
  forth, and that I may be master of my legs, and let me live there like<br>
  Nebertcher upon his throne. Let the gods of the Tuat hold me in<br>
  fear, and let them fight for me in their halls. Grant thou that I<br>
  may move forward with him and with the Ariu gods, and let me be firmly<br>
  stablished on my pedestal like the Lord of Life. Let me be in the<br>
  company of Isis, the goddess, and let [the gods] keep me safe from him<br>
  that would do an injury unto me. Let none come to see the helpless<br>
  one. May I advance, and may I come to the Henti boundaries of the sky.<br>
  Let me address words to Keb, and let me make supplicaion to the god Hu<br>
  with Nebertcher. Let the gods of the Tuat be afraid of me, and let<br>
  them fight for me in their halls. Let them see that thou hast provided<br>
  me with food for the festival. I am one of those Spirit-souls who<br>
  dwell in the Light-god. I have made my form in his Form, when he<br>
  cometh to Tetu. I am a Spirit-body among his Spirit-bodies; he shall<br>
  speak unto thee the things [which concern] me. Would that he would<br>
  cause me to be held in fear! Would that he would create [in them]<br>
  awe of me! Let the gods of the Tuat be afraid of me, and let them<br>
  fight for me [in their halls]. I, even I, am a Spirit-soul, a<br>
  dweller in the Light-god, whose form hath been created in divine<br>
  flesh. I am one of those Spirit-souls who dwell in the Light-god,<br>
  who were created by Tem himself, and who exist in the blossoms of<br>
  his Eye. He hath made to exist, he hath made glorious, and he hath<br>
  magnified their faces during their existence with him. Behold, he is<br>
  Alone in Nu. They acclaim him when he cometh forth from the horizon,<br>
  and the gods and the Spirit-souls who have come into being with him<br>
  ascribe fear unto him.<br>
  I am one of the worms which have been created by the Eye of the Lord<br>
  One. And behold, when as yet Isis had not given birth to Horus, I<br>
  was flourishing, and I had waxed old, and had become pre-eminent among<br>
  the Spirit-souls who had come into being with him. I rose up like a<br>
  divine hawk, and Horus endowed me with a Spirit-body with his soul, so<br>
  that [I] might take possession of the property of Osiris in the<br>
  Tuat. He shall say to the twin Lion-gods for me, the Chief of the<br>
  House of the Nemes Crown, the Dweller in his cavern: Get thee back<br>
  to the heights of heaven, for behold, inasmuch as thou art a<br>
  Spirit-body with the creations of Horus, the Nemes Crown shall not<br>
  be to thee: [but] thou shalt have speech even to the uttermost<br>
  limits of the heavens. I, the warder, took possession of the<br>
  property of Horus [which belonged] to Osiris in the Tuat, and Horus<br>
  repeated to me what his father Osiris had said unto him in the years<br>
  [past], on the days of his burial. Give thou to me the Nemes Crown,<br>
  say the twin Lion-gods for me. Advance thou, come along the road of<br>
  heaven, and look upon those who dwell in the uttermost limits of the<br>
  horizon. The gods of the Tuat shall hold thee in fear, and they<br>
  shall fight for thee in their halls. The god Auhet belongeth to<br>
  them. All the gods who guard the shrine of the Lord One are smitten<br>
  with terror at [my] words.<br>
  Hail, saith the god who is exalted upon his coffer to me! He hath<br>
  bound on the Nemes Crown, [by] the decree of the twin Lion-gods. The<br>
  god Aahet hath made a way for me. I am exalted [on the coffer], the<br>
  twin Lion-gods have bound the Nemes Crown on me and my two locks of<br>
  hair are given unto me. He hath stablished for me my heart by his<br>
  own flesh, and by his great, two-fold strength, and I shall not fall<br>
  headlong before Shu. I am Hetep, the Lord of the two Uraei-goddesses<br>
  who are to be adored. I know the Light-god, his winds are in my<br>
  body. The Bull which striketh terror [into souls] shall not repulse<br>
  me. I come daily into the House of the twin Lion-gods. I come forth<br>
  therefrom into the House of Isis. I look upon the holy things which<br>
  are hidden. I see the being who is therein. I speak to the great<br>
  ones of Shu, they repulse him that is wrathful in his hour. I am Horus<br>
  who dwelleth in his divine Light. I am master of his crown. I am<br>
  master of his radiance. I advance towards the Henti boundaries of<br>
  heaven. Horus is upon his seat. Horus is upon his thrones. My face<br>
  is like that of a divine hawk. I am one who is equipped [like] his<br>
  lord. I shall come forth to Tetu. I shall see Osiris. I shall live<br>
  in his actual presence.... Nut. They shall see me. I shall see the<br>
  gods [and] the Eye of Horus burning with fire before my eyes. They<br>
  shall reach out their hands to me. I shall stand up. I shall be master<br>
  of him that would subject me to restraint. They shall open the holy<br>
  paths to me, they shall see my form, they shall listen to my words.<br>
  [Homage] to you, O ye gods of the Tuat, whose faces are turned back,<br>
  whose powers advance, conduct ye me to the Star-gods which never rest.<br>
  Prepare ye for me the holy ways to the Hemat house, and to your god,<br>
  the Soul, who is the mighty one of terror. Horus hath commanded me<br>
  to lift up your faces; do ye look upon me. I have risen up like a<br>
  divine hawk. Horus hath made me to be a Spirit-body by means of his<br>
  Soul, and to take possession of the things of Osiris in the Tuat. Make<br>
  ye for me a path. I have travelled and I have arrived at those who are<br>
  chiefs of their caverns, and who are guardians of the House of Osiris.<br>
  I speak unto them his mighty deeds. I made them to know concerning his<br>
  victories. He is ready [to butt with his] two horns at Set. They<br>
  know him who hath taken possession of the god Hu, and who hath taken<br>
  possession of the Powers of Tem.<br>
  Travel thou on thy way safely, cry out the gods of the Tuat to me. O<br>
  ye who make your names pre-eminent, who are chiefs in your shrines,<br>
  and who are guardians of the House of Osiris, grant, I pray you,<br>
  that I may come to you. I have bound up and I have gathered together<br>
  your Powers. I have directed the Powers of the ways, the wardens of<br>
  the horizon, and of the Hemat House of heaven. I have stablished their<br>
  fortresses for Osiris. I have prepared the ways for him. I have<br>
  performed the things which [he] hath commanded. I come forth to<br>
  Tetu. I see Osiris. I speak to him concerning the matter of his<br>
  Great Son, whom he loveth, and concerning [the smiting of] the heart<br>
  of Set. I look upon the lord who was helpless. How shall I make them<br>
  to know the plans of the gods, and that which Horus did without the<br>
  knowledge of his father Osiris?<br>
  Hail, Lord, thou Soul, most awful and terrible, behold me. I have<br>
  come, I make thee to be exalted! I have forced a way though the<br>
  Tuat. I have opened the roads which appertain to heaven, and those<br>
  which appertain to the earth, and no one hath opposed me therein. I<br>
  have exalted thy face, O Lord of Eternity.<br>

  sprung from the essence of his divine father and from his decay. He<br>

  stood up. I have gone about collecting his father. Horus hath<br>
  delivered his father. Horus hath delivered [his mother]. My mother<br>

<p>THE CHAPTER OF BEING TRANSFORMED INTO THE PRINCE OF THE TCHATCHAU<br>
  CHIEFS. The Osiris Nu, whose word is truth, saith:- I am the god<br>
  Tem, the maker of the sky, the creator of the things which are, who<br>
  cometh forth from the earth, who made the seed of man to come into<br>
  being, the Lord of things, who fashioned the gods, the Great God,<br>
  who created himself, the Lord of Life, who made to flourish the Two<br>
  Companies of the Gods. Homage to you, O ye divine Lords of things,<br>
  ye holy beings, whose seats are veiled! Homage to you, O ye Lords of<br>
  Eternity, whose forms are concealed, whose sanctuaries are<br>
  mysteries, whose places of abode are not known! Homage to you, O ye<br>
  gods, who dwell in the Tenait (Circle of Light)! Homage to you, O ye<br>
  gods of the Circle of the country of the Cataracts! Homage to you, O<br>
  ye gods who dwell in Amentet! Homage to you, O ye gods who dwell<br>
  within Nut! Grant ye to me that I may come before you, I am pure, I am<br>
  like a god. I am endowed with a Spirit-soul. I am strong. I am endowed<br>
  with a Heart-soul. I bring unto you incense, and spice, and natron.<br>
  I have done away with the chidings of your mouths. I have come, I have<br>
  done away the evil which was in your hearts, and I have removed the<br>
  offences which appertained to you [against me]. I bring to you deeds<br>
  of well-doing, and I present before you truth. I know you. I know your<br>
  names. I know your forms which are not known. I come into being<br>
  among you. My coming is like unto that god who eateth men, and who<br>
  feedeth upon the gods. I am strong before you even like that god who<br>
  is exalted upon his pedestal, unto whom the gods come with<br>
  rejoicing, and the goddesses make supplication when they see me. I<br>
  have come unto you. I have ascended my throne like your Two Daughters.<br>
  I have taken my seat in the horizon. I receive my offerings of<br>
  propitiation upon my altars. I drink my fill of seth wine every<br>
  evening. I come to those who are making rejoicings, and the gods who<br>
  live in the horizon ascribe unto me praises, as the divine<br>
  Spirit-body, the Lord of mortals. I am exalted like that holy god<br>
  who dwelleth in the Great House. The gods rejoice greatly when they<br>
  see my beautiful appearances from the body of the goddess Nut, and<br>
  when the goddess Nut bringeth me forth.</p>
<p>[THE CHAPTER OF] MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE SERPENT SATA.<br>
  The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I am the serpent Sata<br>
  whose years are infinite. I lie down dead. I am born daily. I am the<br>
  serpent Sa-en-ta, the dweller in the uttermost parts of the earth. I<br>
  lie down in death. I am born, I become new, I renew my youth every<br>
  day.</p>
<p>[THE CHAPTER OF] MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE CROCODILE-GOD.<br>
  The Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I am the Crocodile-god<br>
  (Sebak) who dwelleth amid his terrors. I am the Crocodile-god and I<br>
  seize [my prey] like a ravening beast. I am the great Fish which is in<br>
  Kamui. I am the Lord to whom bowings and prostrations are made in<br>
  Sekhem. And the Osiris Ani is the lord to whom bowings and<br>
  prostrations are made in Sekhem.</p>
<p><br>
  (From the Papyrus of Nebseni)</p>
<p>Behold, I am the dweller in his terrors, I am the crocodile, his<br>
  firstborn. I bring (prey) from a distance. I am the Fish of Horus, the<br>
  Great One in Kamui. I am the lord of bowings in Sekhem.</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO PTAH. The Osiris Ani<br>
  [whose word is truth, saith]:- I eat bread. I drink ale. I gird up<br>
  my garments. I fly like a hawk. I cackle like the Smen goose. I alight<br>
  upon that place hard by the Sepulchre on the festival of the Great<br>
  God. That which is abominable, that which is abominable I will not<br>
  eat. [An abominable thing] is filth, I will not eat thereof. That<br>
  which is an abomination unto my KA shall not enter my body. I will<br>
  live upon that whereon live the gods and the Spirit-souls. I shall<br>
  live, and I shall be master of their cakes. I am master of them, and I<br>
  shall eat them under the trees of the dweller in the House of<br>
  Hathor, my Lady. I will make an offering. My cakes are in Tetu, my<br>
  offerings are in Anu. I gird about myself the robe which is woven<br>
  for me by the goddess Tait. I shall stand up and sit down in<br>
  whatsoever place it pleaseth me to do so. My head is like unto that of<br>
  Ra. I am gathered together like Tem.<br>
  Here offer the four cakes of Ra, and the offerings of the earth.<br>
  I shall come forth. My tongue is like that of Ptah, and my throat is<br>
  like unto that of Hathor, and I remember the words of Tem, of my<br>
  father, with my mouth. He forced the woman, the wife of Keb,<br>
  breaking the heads near him; therefore was the fear of him there.<br>
  [His] praises are repeated with vigour. I am decreed to be the Heir,<br>
  the lord of the earth of Keb. I have union with women. Keb hath<br>
  refreshed me, and he hath caused me to ascend his throne. Those who<br>
  dwell in Anu bow their heads to me. I am [their] Bull, I am stronger<br>
  than [the Lord] of the hour. I unite with women. I am master for<br>
  millions of years.</p>
<p>[THE CHAPTER OF] MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE SOUL OF TEM. The<br>
  Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- I shall not enter into the<br>
  place of destruction, I shall not perish, I shall not know [decay].<br>
  I am Ra, who came forth from Nu, the Soul of the God who created his<br>
  own members. What I abominate is sin; I will not look thereon. I cry<br>
  not out against truth, nay, I live therein. I am the god Hu, the<br>
  imperishable god, in my name of &quot;Soul.&quot; I have created myself with 
  Nu,<br>
  in the name of &quot;Khepera.&quot; I exist in them like Ra. I am the Lord of<br>
  Light.<br>
  APPENDIX<br>

  (From the Papyrus of Nu)</p>
<p>That which is an abomination unto me is death; let me not go into<br>
  the chamber of torture which is in the Tuat. I am the delight of the<br>
  Khu of Osiris. I make to be content the heart[s] of those who dwell<br>
  among the divine things which are beloved [by me]. They cause the fear<br>
  of me [to abound], they create the awe of me to be in those divine<br>
  beings who dwell in their own circles. Behold, I am exalted on my<br>
  own standard, and upon my throne, and upon my seat which is assigned<br>
  [to me]. I am the god Nu, and those who commit sin shall not destroy<br>
  me. I am the firstborn of the primeval god, and my soul is the Souls<br>
  of the Eternal Gods, and my body is Everlastingness. My created form<br>
  is [that of] the god Eternity, the Lord of Years, and the Prince of<br>
  Everlastingness. I am the Creator of the Darkness, who maketh his seat<br>
  in the uttermost limits of the heavens, [which] I love. I arrive at<br>
  their boundaries. I advance upon my two legs. I direct my resting<br>
  place. I sail over the sky. I fetter and destroy the hidden serpents<br>
  which are about my footsteps [in going to] the Lord of the Two Arms.<br>
  My soul is the Souls of the Eternal Gods, and my body is<br>
  Everlastingness. I am the exalted one, the Lord of the Land of Tebu. I<br>

  &quot;Imperishable one&quot; is my name. I am the Soul Creator of Nu. I make<br>
  my habitation in Khert-Neter. My nest is invisible, my egg is not<br>
  broken. I have done away the evil which is in me. I shall see my<br>
  Father, the Lord of the Evening. His body dwelleth in Anu. I am made<br>
  to be the Light-god, a dweller in the Light-god, over the Western<br>
  Domain of the Hebt bird.</p>
<p>[THE CHAPTER OF] MAKING THE TRANSFORMATION INTO THE BENU BIRD. The<br>

  germinated like the plants. I am concealed like the tortoise [in his<br>
  shell]. I am the seed of every god. I am Yesterday of the Four<br>
  [Quarters of the Earth, and] the Seven Uraei, who came into being in<br>
  the Eastern land. [I am] the Great One (Horus) who illumineth the<br>
  Hememet spirits with the light of his body. [I am] that god in respect<br>
  of Set. [I am] Thoth who [stood] between them (Horus and Set) as the<br>
  judge on behalf of the Governor of Sekhem and the Souls of Anu. [He<br>
  was like] a stream between them. I have come. I rise up on my<br>

  godhood among the gods. I am Khensu, [the lord] of every kind of<br>
  strength.</p>

  illuminer of the darkness, the uniter of the two Rehti deities, the<br>

  was with him in the Valley of Abtu hath fallen. I rest. I remember<br>
  him. The god Hu hath taken possession of me in my town. I found him<br>
  there. I have carried away the darkness by my strength, I have<br>
  filled the Eye [of Ra] when it was helpless, and when it came not on<br>

  houses against the Aged One who was with him. I have equipped Thoth in<br>
  the House of the Moon-god, when the fifteenth day of the festival come<br>
  not. I have taken possession of the Urrt Crown. Truth is in my body;<br>

  the lapis-lazuli, among the furrows thereof. I am Hem-Nu, the<br>
  lightener of the darkness. I have come to lighten the darkness; it<br>
  is light. I have lightened the darkness. I have overthrown the<br>
  ashmiu-fiends. I have sung hymns to those who dwell in the darkness. I<br>
  have made to stand up the weeping ones, whose faces were covered over;<br>
  they were in a helpless state of misery. Look ye then upon me. I am<br>
  Hem-Nu. I will not let you hear concerning it. [I have fought. I am<br>
  Hem-Nu. I have lightened the darkness. I have come. I have made an end<br>
  to the darkness which hath become light indeed.]</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF NOT DYING A SECOND TIME. The Osiris Ani, whose word<br>
  is truth, saith:- Hail, Thoth! What is it that hath happened to the<br>
  children of Nut? They have waged war, they have upheld strife, they<br>
  have done evil, they have created the fiends, they have made<br>
  slaughter, they have caused trouble; in truth, in all their doings the<br>
  strong have worked against the weak. Grant, O might of Thoth, that<br>
  that which the god Tem hath decreed [may be done!] And thou<br>
  regardest not evil, nor art thou provoked to anger when they bring<br>
  their years to confusion, and throng in and push in to disturb their<br>
  months. For in all that they have done unto thee they have worked<br>
  iniquity in secret. I am they writing-palette, O Thoth, and I have<br>
  brought unto thee thine ink-jar. I am not of those who work iniquity<br>
  in their secret places; let not evil happen unto me.<br>
  The Osiris, the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:- Hail, Temu!<br>
  What manner of land is this unto which I have come? It hath not water,<br>
  it hath not air; it is depth unfathomable, it is black as the blackest<br>
  night, and men wander helplessly therein. In it a man cannot live in<br>
  quietness of heart; nor may the longings of love be satisfied therein.<br>
  But let the state of the Spirit-souls be given unto me instead of<br>
  water and air, and the satisfying of the longings of love, and let<br>
  quietness of heart be given unto me instead of cakes and ale. The<br>
  god Tem hath decreed that I shall see thy face, and that I shall not<br>
  suffer from the things which pain thee. May every god transmit unto<br>
  thee his throne for millions of years. Thy throne hath descended<br>
  unto thy son Horus, and the god Tem hath decreed that thy course shall<br>
  be among the holy princes. In truth he shall rule from thy throne, and<br>
  he shall be heir to the throne of the Dweller in the fiery Lake<br>
  [Neserser]. In truth it hath been decreed that in me he shall see<br>
  his likeness, and that my face shall look upon the face of the Lord<br>
  Tem. How long then have I to live? It is decreed that thou shalt<br>
  live for millions of years, a life of millions of years. Let it be<br>
  granted to me to pass on to the holy princes, for indeed, I have<br>
  done away all the evil which I committed, from the time when this<br>
  earth came into being from Nu, when it sprang from the watery abyss<br>
  even as it was in the days of old. I am Fate and Osiris, I have made<br>
  my transformations into the likeness of divers serpents. Man knoweth<br>
  not, and the gods cannot behold the two-fold beauty which I have<br>
  made for Osiris, the greatest of the gods. I have given unto him the<br>
  region of the dead. And, verily, his son Horus is seated upon the<br>
  throne of the Dweller in the fiery Lake [of Neserser], as his heir.<br>
  I have made him to have his throne in the Boat of Millions of Years.<br>
  Horus is stablished upon his throne [among his] kinsmen, and he hath<br>
  all that is with him. Verily, the Soul of Set, which is greater than<br>
  all the gods, hath departed. Let it be granted to me to bind his<br>
  soul in fetter in the Boat of the God, when I please, and let him hold<br>
  the Body of the God in fear. O my father Osiris, thou hast done for me<br>
  that which thy father Ra did for thee. Let me abide upon the earth<br>
  permanently. Let me keep possession of my throne. Let my heir be<br>
  strong. Let my tomb, and my friends who are upon the earth,<br>
  flourish. Let my enemies be given over to destruction, and to the<br>
  shackles of the goddess Serq. I am thy son. Ra is my father. On me<br>
  likewise thou hast conferred life, strength, and health. Horus is<br>
  established upon his tomb. Grant thou that the days of my life may<br>
  come unto worship and honour.<br>

<p>[THE CHAPTER OF] ENTERING INTO THE HALL OF MAATI TO PRAISE OSIRIS<br>
  KHENTI-AMENTI. The Osiris the scribe Ani, whose word is truth, saith:-<br>
  I have come unto thee. I have drawn nigh to behold thy beauties (thy<br>
  beneficient goodness). My hands are [extended] in adoration of thy<br>
  name of &quot;Maat.&quot; I have come. I have drawn nigh unto [the place<br>
  where] the cedar-tree existeth not, where the acacia tree doth not put<br>
  forth shoots, and where the ground produceth neither grass nor<br>
  herbs. Now I have entered into the habitation which is hidden, and I<br>
  hold converse with Set. My protector advanced to me, covered was his<br>
  face.... on the hidden things. He entered into the house of Osiris, he<br>
  saw the hidden things which were therein. The Tchatchau Chiefs of<br>
  the Pylons were in the form of Spirits. The god Anpu spake unto<br>
  those about him with the words of a man who cometh from Ta-mera,<br>
  saying, &quot;He knoweth our roads and our towns. I am reconciled unto him.<br>
  When I smell his odour it is even as the odour of one of you.&quot; And I<br>
  say unto him: I the Osiris Ani, whose word is truth, in peace, whose<br>
  word is truth, have come. I have drawn nigh to behold the Great<br>
  Gods. I would live upon the propitiatory offerings [made] to their<br>
  Doubles. I would live on the borders [of the territory of] the Soul,<br>
  the Lord of Tetu. He shall make me to come forth in the form of a Benu<br>
  bird, and to hold converse [with him.] I have been in the stream [to<br>
  purify myself]. I have made offerings of incense. I betook myself to<br>
  the Acacia Tree of the [divine] Children. I lived in Abu in the<br>
  House of the goddess Satet. I made to sink in the water the boat of<br>
  the enemies. I sailed over the lake [in the temple] in the Neshmet<br>
  Boat. I have looked upon the Sahu of Kamur. I have been in Tetu. I<br>
  have held my peace. I have made the god to be master of his legs. I<br>
  have been in the House of Teptuf. I have seen him, that is the<br>
  Governor of the Hall of the God. I have entered into the House of<br>
  Osiris and I have removed the head-coverings of him that is therein. I<br>
  have entered into Rasta, and I have seen the Hidden One who is<br>
  therein. I was hidden, but I found the boundary. I journeyed to<br>
  Nerutef, and he who was therein covered me with a garment. I have<br>
  myrrh of women, together with the shenu powder of living folk.<br>
  Verily he (Osiris) told me the things which concerned himself. I said:<br>
  Let thy weighing of me be even as we desire.<br>
  And the Majesty of Anpu shall say unto me, &quot;Knowest thou the name of<br>
  this door, and canst thou tell it?&quot; And the Osiris the scribe Ani,<br>
  whose word is truth, in peace, whose word is truth, shall say,<br>
  &quot;Khersek-Shu&quot; is the name of this door. And the Majesty of the god<br>
  Anpu shall say unto me, &quot;Knowest thou the name of the upper leaf,<br>
  and the name of the lower leaf?&quot; [And the Osiris the scribe Ani] shall<br>
  say: &quot;Neb-Maat-heri-retiu-f&quot; is the name of the upper leaf and<br>
  &quot;Neb-pehti-thesu-menment&quot; [is the name of the lower leaf. And the<br>
  Majesty of the god Anpu shall say], &quot;Pass on, for thou hast knowledge,<br>
  O Osiris the scribe, the assessor of the holy offerings of all the<br>
  gods of Thebes Ani, whose word is truth, the lord of loyal service [to<br>
  Osiris].&quot;<br>

<p>[THE FOLLOWING] WORDS SHALL BE SAID BY THE STEWARD OF THE KEEPER<br>
  OF THE SEAL, NU, WHOSE WORD IS TRUTH, WHEN HE COMETH FORTH TO THE HALL<br>
  OF MAATI, SO THAT HE MAY BE SEPARATED FROM EVERY SIN WHICH HE HATH<br>
  COMMITTED, AND MAY BEHOLD THE FACES OF THE GODS. The Osiris Nu,<br>
  whose word is truth, saith: Homage to thee, O great God, Lord of<br>
  Maati! I have come unto thee, O my Lord, and I have brought myself<br>
  hither that I may behold thy beauties. I know thee, I know thy name, I<br>
  know the names of the Forty-two Gods who live with thee in this Hall<br>
  of Maati, who live by keeping ward over sinners, and who feed upon<br>
  their blood on the day when the consciences of men are reckoned up<br>
  in the presence of the god Un-Nefer. In truth thy name is<br>
  &quot;Rehti-Merti-Nebti-Maati.&quot; In truth I have come unto thee, I have<br>
  brought Maati (Truth) to thee. I have done away sin for thee. I have<br>
  not committed sins against men. I have not opposed my family and<br>
  kinsfolk. I have not acted fraudulently in the Seat of Truth. I have<br>
  not known men who were of no account. I have not wrought evil. I<br>
  have not made it to be the first [consideration daily that<br>
  unnecessary] work should be done for me. I have not brought forward my<br>
  name for dignities. I have not [attempted] to direct servants [I<br>
  have not belittled God]. I have not defrauded the humble man of his<br>
  property. I have not done what the gods abominate. I have not vilified<br>
  a slave to his master. I have not inflicted pain. I have not caused<br>
  anyone to go hungry. I have not made any man to weep. I have not<br>
  committed murder. I have not given the order for murder to be<br>
  committed. I have not caused calamities to befall men and women. I<br>
  have not plundered the offerings in the temples. I have not<br>
  defrauded the gods of their cake-offerings. I have not carried off the<br>
  fenkhu cakes [offered to] the Spirits. I have not committed<br>
  fornication. I have not masturbated [in the sanctuaries of the god<br>
  of my city]. I have not diminished from the bushel. I have not filched<br>
  [land from my neighbour's estate and] added it to my own acre. I<br>
  have not encroached upon the fields [of others]. I have not added to<br>
  the weights of the scales. I have not depressed the pointer of the<br>
  balance. I have not carried away the milk from the mouths of children.<br>
  I have not driven the cattle away from their pastures. I have not<br>
  snared the geese in the goose-pens of the gods. I have not caught fish<br>
  with bait made of the bodies of the same kind of fish. I have not<br>
  stopped water when it should flow. I have not made a cutting in a<br>
  canal of running water. I have not extinguished a fire when it<br>
  should burn. I have not violated the times [of offering] the chosen<br>
  meat offerings. I have not driven away the cattle on the estates of<br>
  the gods. I have not turned back the god at his appearances. I am<br>
  pure. I am pure. I am pure. My pure offerings are the pure offerings<br>
  of that great Benu which dwelleth in Hensu. For behold, I am the<br>
  nose of Neb-nefu (the lord of the air), who giveth sustenance unto all<br>
  mankind, on the day of the filling of the Utchat in Anu, in the second<br>
  month of the season Pert, on the last of the month, [in the presence<br>
  of the Lord of this earth]. I have seen the filling of the Utchat in<br>
  Anu, therefore let not calamity befall me in this land, or in this<br>
  Hall of Maati, because I know the names of the gods who are therein,<br>
  [and who are the followers of the Great God].<br>

<p><br>
  ADDRESS TO THE GODS OF THE TUAT<br>
  (From the Papyrus of Nu, Brit. Mus. No. 10477, Sheet 24)</p>
<p>THE FOLLOWING ARE THE WORDS WHICH THE HEART OF TRUTH THAT IS SINLESS<br>
  SHALL SAY WHEN HE COMETH WITH THE WORD OF TRUTH INTO THE HALL OF<br>
  MAATI; THEY SHALL BE SAID WHEN HE COMETH TO THE GODS WHO DWELL IN<br>
  THE TUAT; AND THEY ARE THE WORDS WHICH ARE [TO BE SAID] AFTER [HE<br>
  COMETH FORTH FROM] THE HALL OF MAATI.</p>
<p>Nu, the steward of the keeper of the seal, whose word is truth,<br>
  saith:- Homage to you, O ye gods who dwell in your Hall of Maati! I<br>
  know you, I know your names. Let me not fall under your knives of<br>
  slaughter, and bring ye not forward my wickedness to this god in whose<br>
  following ye are. Let not evil hap come upon me through you. Speak<br>
  ye the truth concerning me in the presence of Neb-er-tcher, for I have<br>
  done what is right and just in Ta-Mera. I have not cursed the god, and<br>
  my evil hap did not come upon him that was king in his day.<br>
  Homage to you, O ye who dwell in your Hall of Maati, who have<br>
  nothing false in your bodies, who live upon Truth, who feed yourselves<br>
  upon Truth in the presence of Horus who dwelleth in his Disk,<br>
  deliver ye me from Beba, who feedeth upon the livers of the great ones<br>
  on the day of the Great Judgment. Grant ye that I may come before you,<br>
  for I have not committed sin, I have done no act of deceit, I have<br>
  done no evil thing, and I have not borne [false] witness; therefore<br>
  let nothing [evil] be done to me. I have lived upon truth, I have<br>
  fed upon truth, I have performed the ordinances of men, and the things<br>
  which gratify the gods. I have propitiated the god by doing his<br>
  will, I have given bread to the hungry man, and water to him that<br>
  was athirst, and apparel to the naked man, and a ferry-boat to him<br>
  that had no boat. I have made propitiatory offerings and given cakes<br>
  to the gods, and the &quot;things which appear at the word&quot; to the Spirits.<br>
  Deliver then ye me, protect then ye me, and make ye no report<br>
  against me in the presence [of the Great God]. I am pure in respect of<br>
  my mouth, and I am clean in respect of my hands, therefore let it be<br>
  said unto me by those who shall behold me: &quot;Come in peace, Come in<br>
  peace.&quot; For I have heard that great word which the Sahu spake to the<br>
  CAT, in the House of Hapt-ra. I have borne witness to Her-f-ha-f,<br>
  and he hath given a decision [concerning me]. I have seen the things<br>
  over which the Persea tree which is in Rasta, spreadeth its<br>
  branches. I have made petitions to the gods, [and I] know the things<br>
  [which appertain to] their bodies. I have come, travelling a long<br>
  road, to bear righteous testimony, and to set the Balance upon its<br>
  supports within Aukert.<br>
  Hail, thou who art exalted high upon thy standard, thou Lord of<br>
  the Atef Crown, who dost make thy name to be &quot;Lord of the Winds,&quot;<br>
  deliver thou me from thy divine Envoys who punish and afflict<br>
  according to [thy] decrees, and who make calamities to arise, and<br>
  whose faces are without coverings, for I have done what is right and<br>
  true for the Lord of Truth. I am pure. My breast is purified by<br>
  libations, and my hinder parts are made clean with the things which<br>
  make clean, and my inner parts have been dipped in the Lake of<br>
  Truth. There is no single member of mine which lacketh truth. I have<br>
  washed myself clean in the Lake of the South. I have rested myself<br>
  in the City of the North, which is in Sekhet Sanhemu (the Field of the<br>
  Grasshoppers), where the mariners of Ra wash themselves clean at the<br>
  second hour of the night, and at the third hour of the day. The hearts<br>
  of the gods are gratified when they have passed over it, whether it be<br>
  by night or whether it be by day, and they say unto me, &quot;Let thyself<br>
  advance.&quot; They say unto me, &quot;Who art thou?&quot; And they say unto 
  me,<br>
  &quot;What is thy name?&quot; [And I reply], &quot;Sept-kheri-nehait-ammi-beq-f&quot; 
  is<br>
  my name. Then they say unto me, &quot;Advance straightway on the city which<br>
  is to the North of the Olive Tree. What dost thou see there?&quot; The<br>
  Leg and the Thigh. What dost thou say unto them? Let me see rejoicings<br>
  in these lands of the Fenkhu. What do they give unto thee? A flame<br>
  of fire and a sceptre-amulet [made] of crystal. What dost thou do with<br>
  them? I bury them on the furrow of M'naat, as things for the night.<br>
  What dost thou find on the furrow of Maat? A sceptre of flint, the<br>
  name of which is &quot;Giver of winds.&quot; What now didst thou do with the<br>
  flame of fire and the sceptre-amulet [made] of crystal, after thou<br>
  didst bury them? I said a spell over them, and I dug them up. I<br>
  quenched the flame of fire and I broke the sceptre-amulet, and I<br>
  made a lake of water. [Then shall the Two and forty gods say unto me]:<br>
  &quot;Come now, pass in over the threshold of this door of the Hall of<br>
  Maati, for thou hast knowledge of us.&quot; &quot;We will not allow thee to<br>
  enter in over us,&quot; say the bars of this door, &quot;unless thou tellest<br>
  us our names.&quot; [And I reply], &quot;Tekh-bu-maa&quot; is your name. The 
  right<br>
  lintel of this door saith: &quot;I will not allow thee to pass over me<br>
  unless thou tellest me my name.&quot; [And I reply], &quot;Henku-en-fat-maat&quot; 
  is<br>
  thy name. The left lintel of this door saith: &quot;I will not allow<br>
  thee to pass over me unless thou tellest me my name.&quot; [And I reply],<br>
  &quot;Henku-en-arp&quot; is thy name. The ground of this door saith: &quot;I 
  will not<br>
  allow thee to pass over me unless thou tellest me my name.&quot; [And I<br>
  reply], &quot;Aua-en-Keb&quot; is thy name. And the bolt of this door saith:<br>
  &quot;I will not open the door to thee unless thou tellest me my name.&quot;<br>
  [And I reply], &quot;Saah-en-mut-f&quot; is thy name. The socket of the<br>
  fastening of this door saith: &quot;I will not open unto thee unless thou<br>
  tellest my name.&quot; [And I reply], &quot;The Living Eye of Sebek, the Lord 
  of<br>
  Bakhau,&quot; is thy name. The Doorkeeper of this door saith: &quot;I will not<br>
  open to thee, and I will not let thee enter by me unless thou<br>
  tellest my name.&quot; [And I reply], &quot;Elbow of the god Shu who placeth<br>
  himself to protect Osiris&quot; is thy name. The posts of this door say:<br>
  &quot;We will not let thee pass in by us unless thou tellest our name.&quot;<br>
  [And I reply], &quot;Children of the uraei-goddesses&quot; is your name. The<br>
  Doorkeeper of this door saith: &quot;I will not open to thee, and I will<br>
  not let thee enter in by me unless thou tellest my name. [And I<br>
  reply], &quot;Ox of Keb&quot; is thy name. [And they reply], &quot;Thou knowest 
  us,<br>
  pass in therefore by us.&quot; The ground of this Hall of Maati saith: &quot;I<br>
  will not let thee tread upon me [unless thou tellest me my name],<br>
  for I am silent. I am holy because I know the names of two feet<br>
  wherewith thou wouldst walk upon me. Declare, then, them to me.&quot;<br>
  [And I reply], &quot;Besu-Ahu&quot; is the name of my right foot, and<br>
  &quot;Unpet-ent-Het-Heru&quot; is the name of my left foot. [The ground<br>
  replieth]: &quot;Thou knowest us, enter in therefore over us.&quot; The<br>
  Doorkeeper of this Hall of Maati saith: &quot;I will not announce thee<br>
  unless thou tellest my name.&quot; [And I reply], &quot;Discerner of hearts,<br>
  searcher of bellies&quot; is thy name. [The Doorkeeper saith]: &quot;Thou<br>
  shalt be announced.&quot; [He saith]: &quot;Who is the god who dwelleth in his<br>
  hour? Speak it&quot; [And I reply], &quot;Au-taui.&quot; [He saith]: &quot;Explain 
  who<br>
  he is.&quot; [And I reply], &quot;Au-taui&quot; is Thoth. &quot;Come now,&quot; 
  saith Thoth,<br>
  &quot;for what purpose hast thou come?&quot; [And I reply]: &quot;I have come, 
  and<br>
  have journeyed hither that my name may be announced [to the god].&quot;<br>
  [Thoth saith]: &quot;In what condition art thou?&quot; [And I reply], &quot;I, 
  even<br>
  I, am purified from evil defects, and I am wholly free from the curses<br>
  of those who live in their days, and I am not one of their number.&quot;<br>
  [Thoth saith]: &quot;Therefore shall [thy name] be announced to the god.&quot;<br>
  [Thoth saith]: &quot;Tell me, who is he whose heaven is of fire, whose<br>
  walls are living serpents, and whose ground is a stream of water?<br>
  Who is he?&quot; [And I reply], &quot;He is Osiris.&quot; [Thoth saith]: &quot;Advance<br>
  now, [thy name] shall be announced to him. Thy cakes shall come from<br>
  the Utchat (Eye of Horus or Ra), thy ale shall come from the Utchat,<br>
  and the offerings which shall appear to thee at the word upon earth<br>
  [shall proceed] from the Utchat.&quot; This is what Osiris hath decreed for<br>
  the steward of the overseer of the seal, Nu, whose word is truth.</p>

  THE CHAPTER OF REPULSING SLAUGHTER IN HENSU<br>
  (From the Papyrus of Nu, Sheet 6)</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF DRIVING BACK THE SLAUGHTERS WHICH ARE PERFORMED IN<br>
  HENSU. The Osiris Nu, whose word is truth, saith:- O thou land of<br>
  the Sceptre! O thou White Crown of the divine form! O thou rest of the<br>
  ferry-boat! I am the Child. (Repeat four times). Hail, Abu-ur! Thou<br>
  sayest daily: &quot;The slaughter-block is made ready as thou knowest,<br>
  and thou hast come to destruction.&quot; I am Ra, who stablisheth those who<br>
  praise him. I am the Knot of the god in the Aser tree, the twice<br>
  beautiful one, who is more splendid to-day than yesterday. (Repeat<br>
  four times). I am Ra, who stablisheth those who praise him. I am the<br>
  Knot of the god within the Aser tree, and my appearance is the<br>
  appearance [of Ra] on this day.<br>
  My hair is the hair of Nu. My face is the face of the Disk. My<br>
  eyes are the eyes of Hathor. My ears are the ears of Up-uat. My nose<br>
  is the nose of Khenti-Khabas. My lips are the lips of Anpu. My teeth<br>
  are the teeth of Serqet. My cheeks are the cheeks of the goddess Isis.<br>
  My hands are the hands of Ba-neb-Tet. My forearms are the forearms<br>
  of Neith, the Lady of Sais. My backbone is the backbone of Suti. My<br>
  phallus is the phallus of Beba. My reins are the reins of the Lords of<br>
  Kher-aha. My chest is the chest of Aa-shefit. My belly and back are<br>
  the belly and back of Sekhmet. My buttocks are the buttocks of the Eye<br>
  of Horus. My hips and legs are the hips and legs of Nut. My feet are<br>
  the feet of Ptah. [My fingers] and my toes are the [fingers and]<br>
  toes of the Living gods. There is no member of my body which is not<br>
  the member of a god. Thoth protecteth my body altogether, and I am<br>
  Ra day by day. I shall not be dragged back by my arms, and none<br>
  shall lay violent hold upon my hands. And shall do me hurt neither<br>
  men, nor gods, nor the Spirit-souls, nor the dead, nor any man, nor<br>
  any pat-spirit, nor any rekhit-spirit, nor any hememet-spirit.<br>
  I am he who cometh forth advancing, whose name is unknown. I am<br>
  Yesterday. &quot;Seer of Millions of Years&quot; is my name. I pass along, I<br>
  pass along the paths of the divine celestial judges. I am the Lord<br>
  of Eternity: I decree and I judge like Khepera. I am the Lord of the<br>
  Urrt Crown. I am he who dwelleth in the Utchat and in the Egg, and<br>
  it is granted unto me to live therein. I am he who dwelleth in the<br>
  Utchat when it closeth, and I exist by the strength thereof. I come<br>
  forth and I shine; I enter in and I come to life. I am in the<br>
  Utchat, my seat is upon my throne, and I sit in the tent chamber<br>
  before it. I am Horus. [I] traverse millions of years. I have<br>
  decreed [the stablishing] of my throne, and I am the ruler thereof;<br>
  and in very truth my mouth keepeth an even balance both in speech<br>
  and in silence. In very truth my forms are inverted. I am Un-Nefer,<br>
  from one period even unto another, and what I have is within me. I<br>
  am the only One, who proceedeth from an only One, who goeth round<br>
  about in his course. I am he who dwelleth in the Utchat. No evil thing<br>
  of any shape or kind shall spring up against me, and no baleful<br>
  object, and no harmful thing, and no disastrous thing shall happen<br>
  unto me. I open the door in heaven. I rule my throne. I open the way<br>
  for the births which take place on this day. I am the child who<br>
  traverseth the road of Yesterday. I am To-day for untold nations and<br>
  peoples. I am he who protecteth you for millions of years. Whether<br>
  ye be denizens of heaven, or of the earth, or of the South, or of<br>
  the North, or of the East, or of the West, the fear of me is in your<br>
  bodies. I am he whose being hath been wrought in his eye. I shall<br>
  not die again. My moment is in your bodies, but my forms are in my<br>
  place of habitation. I am &quot;He who cannot be known.&quot; The Red Fiends<br>
  have their faces directed against me. I am the unveiled one. The<br>
  period when the heavens were created for me and were enlarged the<br>
  bounds of earth, and multiplied the progeny thereof, cannot be found<br>
  out. They shall fail and not be united again. By reason of the<br>
  speech which I address to you, my name setteth itself apart from all<br>
  things evil which are in the mouths of men. I am he who riseth and<br>
  shineth, a wall which cometh out of a wall, an only One who proceedeth<br>
  from an only One. There is never a day that passeth without the things<br>
  which appertain unto him being therein; passing, passing, passing,<br>
  passing. Verily I say unto thee, I am the Plant which cometh forth<br>
  from Nu, and my mother is Nut. Hail, my creator, I am he who hath no<br>
  power to walk, the Great Knot who dwelleth in Yesterday. The might<br>
  of my strength is within my hand, I am not known [by thee], but I am<br>
  he who knoweth thee. I cannot be held in the hand, but I am he who can<br>
  hold thee in his hand. Hail, O Egg! Hail, O Egg! I am Horus who liveth<br>
  for millions of years, whose flame shineth upon you, and bringeth your<br>
  hearts unto me. I am master of my throne. I advance at this season.<br>
  I have opened a path. I have delivered myself from all evil things.<br>
  I am the golden dog-headed ape, three palms and two fingers [high],<br>
  which hath neither arms nor legs, and which dwelleth in Het-ka-Ptah. I<br>
  go forth as goeth forth the dog-headed ape who dwelleth in<br>
  Het-ka-Ptah.</p>

  oppressed man and on [his] oppressor, who make the gods to be<br>
  contented by means of the flame of your mouths, who offer holy<br>
  offerings to the gods, and sepulchral meals to the Spirit-souls, who<br>
  live upon truth, and who feed upon truth of heart, who are without<br>
  deceit and fraud, and to whom wickedness is an abomination, do ye away<br>
  with my evil deeds, and put ye away my sins [which deserved stripes<br>
  upon earth, and destroy ye every evil thing which appertaineth to me],<br>

  that there may be given unto me shens cakes, and ale, and persen<br>
  cakes, even as to the living Spirit-souls, and grant that I may<br>
  enter into and come forth from Rasta.<br>

  away with thy wickedness, and we have put away thy sin, along with thy<br>
  sins upon earth which deserved stripes, and we have destroyed every<br>
  evil thing which appertained to thee upon earth. Enter, therefore,<br>
  unto Rasta, and pass through the hidden pylons of Amentet, and there<br>
  shall be given unto thee shens cakes, and ale, and persen cakes, and<br>
  thou shalt come forth and shalt enter in at thy desire, even as do<br>
  those who are favoured [of the God], and thou shalt be called [to<br>
  partake of offerings] each day in the horizon.</p>

  which cometh forth from the god Tem unto thy nose. I have made whole<br>

  thee, my strength shall be near thee, for ever. Ra hath heard thy cry,<br>
  and the gods have made thy word to be truth. Thou art raised up. Thy<br>

  overthrown thy foes, and thou art Horus, the son of Hathor.]</p>

  himself hath commanded.</p>

  the way be removed from him- whether it be to plough the fields, or to<br>
  fill the channels with water, or to carry sand from [the East to the<br>
  West]. The Shabti Figure replieth: I will do it, verily I am here<br>

<p>HERE BEGIN THE CHAPTERS OF SEKHET-HETEPET, AND THE CHAPTERS OF<br>
  COMING FORTH BY DAY; OF GOING INTO AND OF COMING FORTH FROM<br>
  KHERT-NETER; OF ARRIVAL IN SEKHET-AARU; OF LIVING IN SEKHET-HETEPET,<br>
  THE MIGHTY CITY, THE LADY OF WINDS; OF HAVING POWER THEREIN; OF<br>
  BECOMING A SPIRIT-SOUL THERE; OF PLOUGHING THERE; OF REAPING THERE; OF<br>
  EATING THERE; OF DRINKING THERE; OF MAKING LOVE THERE; AND OF DOING<br>
  EVERYTHING THERE EVEN AS A MAN DOETH UPON EARTH. NEBSENI, THE SCRIBE<br>
  AND DRAUGHTSMAN OF PTAH, SAITH:- Set vanguished Horus, who was looking<br>
  at the building in Sekhet-Hetepet. I set free Horus from Set. Set<br>
  opened the paths of the Two Eyes (the Sun and Moon) in the sky. Set<br>
  ejected water with air upon the soul of his Eye, which dwelt in the<br>
  town of Mert; he delivered the interior of the body of Horus from<br>
  the hands of the Akeru Gods. Behold me! I paddle this great boat<br>
  over the Lake of the god Hetep; I seized upon it in the mansion of<br>
  Shu. The mansion of his stars reneweth youth, reneweth youth. I paddle<br>
  over the Lakes thereof so that I may arrive at the towns thereof. I<br>
  sail up to the town of the god Hetep.... Behold, I am at peace with<br>
  his times, and with his guidance, and with his will, and with the<br>
  Company of the Gods, who are his firstborn. He maketh the Two Fighters<br>
  (Horus and Set) to be at peace [with each other], and to keep ward<br>
  over the living whom he hath created in fair form, and he bringeth<br>
  peace; he maketh the Two Fighters to be at peace with those who<br>
  watch over them. He cutteth off the hair from their divine fighters,<br>
  he driveth away storm from the children. He guardeth from attack the<br>
  Spirits. I have gained power therein. I know it. I have sailed over<br>
  its Lakes so that I might arrive at its towns. My mouth is strong. I<br>
  am equipped against the Spirits. They shall not gain the mastery<br>
  over me. I am rewarded [with] these thy Fields, O god Hetep. What thou<br>
  wishest that do thou, O lord of the winds. I shall be a spirit<br>
  therein. I shall eat therein. I shall drink therein. I shall plough<br>
  therein. I shall reap the grain therein. I shall be strong therein.<br>
  I shall make love therein. My words shall be strong therein. I shall<br>
  not be in subjection therein. I shall be a man of might therein.<br>
  Thou hast made strong the mouth and throat. Hetep Qettbu is its<br>
  name. [It is] stablished upon the pillars of Shu, and is linked with<br>
  the pleasant things of Ra. He is the divider of years, the hidden of<br>
  mouth; silent is his mouth, hidden is what he uttereth, he<br>
  fulfilleth eternity, he taketh possession of everlastingness of<br>
  existence as Hetep, Neb-Hetep. Horus maketh himself strong like unto a<br>
  hawk which is one thousand cubits in length, and two thousand cubits<br>
  in life. He that equipments with him, he journeyeth on, he cometh to<br>
  the place where his heart would be, among the Lakes which are in its<br>
  towns. He begetteth in the birth-chamber of the god of the town, he is<br>
  satisfied with the food of the god of the town; he doeth what ought to<br>
  be done there, in the Field of Smas-er-Khet..... everything of the<br>
  birth-chamber of the god of the town. Now [when he] setteth in the<br>
  [land of] life like crystal he performeth everything therein, [which<br>
  things are] like unto the things done in the Lake Neserser, wherein<br>
  there is none that rejoiceth, and wherein are evil things of all<br>
  kinds. The god Hetep goeth in and cometh out, and marcheth hither<br>
  and thither in the Field of Smas-er-Khet, the Lady of the<br>
  birth-chamber of the god of the town. [Let me] live with the god<br>
  Hetep, clothed, and not despoiled by the Lords of the North, and may<br>
  the Lord of things bring food unto me. May he make me to go forward.<br>
  May I come forth. May he bring to me my Power there, may I receive it,<br>
  and may I be rewarded by the god Hetep. May I be master of the great<br>
  and mighty word in my body in this my place. Make me to remember it.<br>
  Let me [not] forget it. Let me go forward, let me plough. I am at<br>
  peace with the god of the town. I know the water, the towns, the<br>
  nomes, and the lakes which are in Sekhet-Hetepet. I live therein. I am<br>
  strong therein. I shine therein. I eat therein. I..... therein. I reap<br>
  the harvest therein. I plough therein. I beget children therein. I<br>
  am at peace therein with the god Hetep. Behold I sow seed therein. I<br>
  sail about on the lakes thereof, and I arrive at its towns, O god<br>
  Hetep. Behold my mouth is equipped, it possesseth horns . Give unto me<br>
  the abundance of the KAU (Doubles) and Spirit-souls. He who counteth<br>
  me is Shu. I know him not. I come to its towns. I sail over its lakes.<br>
  I walk about in Sekhet-Hetepet. Behold, it is Ra who is in heaven.<br>
  Behold, it is Hetep [who is] its double offering of peace. I have<br>
  advanced to its territory. I have put on my apparel. I have come<br>
  forth. I have given what it was upon me to give. I have made glad in<br>
  [my] heart. I have conquered. I am strong. I have given directions<br>
  to Hetep.<br>
  [Hail], Unen-em-hetep, I have come to thee. My soul followeth me.<br>
  The god Hu is on my hands. [Hail], Nebt-taui, in whom I remember and<br>
  forget, I have become alive. I have attacked none, let none attack me.<br>
  I have given, give thou to me gladness. Make thou me to be at peace,<br>
  bind thou up my veins, let [me] receive air. [Hail], Unen-em-hetep,<br>
  the Lord of Winds. I have come there. I have opened my head. Ra<br>
  sleepeth. I watch not, [for] the goddess Hetemet is at the door of<br>
  heaven by night. Obstacles have been put before, but I have<br>
  collected his emissions. I am in my city. O Nut-urt (Great City), I<br>
  have come into thee. I have counted up my abundant stores. I advance<br>
  on my way to Uakh. I am the Bull which is tied with a rope of<br>
  lapis-lazuli, the lord of the Field of the Bull, the lord of the words<br>
  of the god, the goddess Septet (Sothis) at her hours. O Uakh, I have<br>
  come into thee. I have eaten my food. I am master of choice pieces<br>
  of the flesh of oxen and of feathered fowl, and the birds of Shu<br>
  have been given unto me. I follow the gods, and I come [after the<br>
  Doubles]. O Tcheft, I have come into thee. I array myself in<br>
  apparel, and I gird about myself the sat garment of Ra. Behold the<br>
  Court of the sky, and the followers of Ra who dwell in heaven. O<br>
  Un-em-hetep, the lord of the Two Lands, I have come into thee. I<br>
  have plunged into the Lakes of Tchesert; behold, impurity of every<br>
  kind hath removed from me. The divine Great One flourisheth therein.<br>
  Behold, I have found [him]. I have netted geese, and have fed full<br>
  upon the finest of them. O Qenqentet, I have come into thee. I have<br>
  seen the Osiris [my father]. I have saluted my mother. I have begotten<br>
  children. I have snared the serpents, and I am delivered. I know the<br>
  name of the god who is with the goddess Tchesert, and who hath<br>
  straight hair, and is equipped with horns [ready to gore]. He reapeth,<br>
  and I both plough and reap. O Hetemet, I have entered into thee. I<br>
  have approached the lapis-lazuli. I have followed the winds of the<br>
  Company of the Gods. The Great God hath given my head unto me. He<br>
  who hath bound my head on my body for me is the Mighty One, with<br>
  eyes of lapis-lazuli, namely, Ari-en-ab-f (&quot;He doeth as he pleaseth&quot;).<br>
  O Usert, I have come into thee, to the house wherein food is brought<br>
  unto me. O Smam, I have come into thee. My heart watcheth, my head<br>
  is equipped with the White Crown. I act as the guide of the<br>
  celestial beings. I make to flourish terrestrial beings. There is<br>
  joy of heart for the Bull, and for the celestial beings, and for the<br>
  Company of the Gods. I am the god, the Bull, the Lord of the gods, who<br>
  maketh his way over the turquoise. O wheat and barley of the nome of<br>
  the god, I have come into thee. I have come forward. I have lifted<br>
  [you] up, following the best offerings of the Company of the Gods. I<br>
  have moored my boat to the tying-up post in the lakes of the celestial<br>
  beings. I have pulled up the typing-up post. I have recited words, and<br>
  I have ascribed praises unto the gods who dwell in Sekhet-Hetepet.<br>

  THE CHAPTER OF THE FOUR TORCHES<br>
  (From the Papyrus of Nu, Sheets 26 and 27)</p>
<p>THE CHAPTER OF THE FOUR LIGHTED LAMPS WHICH ARE MADE FOR THE<br>
  SPIRIT-SOUL. Behold, thou shalt make four rectangular troughs of<br>
  clay wherein thou shalt scatter incense, and thou shalt fill them with<br>
  the milk of a white cow, and by means of these thou shalt extinguish<br>
  the lamps. The Osiris Nu, the steward of the overseer of the seal,<br>
  whose word is truth, saith:- The fire cometh to thy KA, O Osiris<br>
  Khenti-Amenti! The fire cometh to thy KA, O Osiris Nu, whose word is<br>
  truth. The ordering of the night cometh after the day. [The fire<br>
  cometh to thy KA, O Osiris, Governor of those who are in Amenti],<br>
  and the two sisters of Ra come likewise. Behold it (the fire) riseth<br>
  in Abtu, and it cometh; I cause it to come, the Eye of Horus. It is<br>
  set in order upon thy brow, O Osiris Khenti-Amenti; it is set in thy<br>
  shrine and riseth on thy brow; it is set on thy brow, O Osiris Nu,<br>
  it is set on thy brow. The Eye of Horus protecteth thee, O Osiris<br>
  Khenti-Amenti, and it keepeth thee in safety; it casteth down headlong<br>
  all thine enemies for thee, and all thine enemies have fallen down<br>
  headlong before thee. O Osiris Nu, the Eye of Horus protecteth thee,<br>
  it keepeth thee in safety, and it casteth down headlong all thine<br>
  enemies. Thine enemies have fallen down headlong before thy KA, O<br>
  Osiris Khenti-Amenti. The Eye of Ra protecteth thee, it keepeth thee<br>
  in safety, and it hath cast down headlong all thine enemies. Thine<br>
  enemies have fallen down headlong before thy KA, O Osiris Nu, whose<br>
  word is truth. The Eye of Horus protecteth thee, it keepeth thee in<br>
  safety, it hath cast down headlong for thee all thine enemies, and<br>
  thine enemies have fallen down headlong before thee. The Eye of<br>
  Horus cometh. It is sound and well, it sendeth forth light even as<br>
  doth Ra in the horizon. It covereth the powers of Suti with<br>
  darkness, it mastereth him, and it bringeth its flame against him by<br>
  its own command. The Eye of Horus is sound and well, thou eatest the<br>
  flesh thereof, thy body possesseth it. Thou acclaimest it. The Four<br>
  Fires enter into thy KA, O Osiris Khenti-Amenti, the Four Fires<br>
  enter into thy KA, O Osiris Nu, the steward of the overseer of the<br>
  seal, whose word is truth.<br>
  Hail, ye sons of Horus, Kesta, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Qebhsenuf, ye<br>
  have given your protection to your divine Father Osiris Khenti-Amenti,<br>
  give ye your protection to the Osiris Nu, whose word is truth. Now<br>
  therefore, inasmuch as ye have destroyed the Opponent of Osiris<br>
  Khenti-Amenti, who liveth with the gods, having smitten Suti with<br>
  his right hand and arm when dawn came upon the earth, and Horus hath<br>
  become master [of Suti], and hath avenged his divine Father himself;<br>
  and inasmuch as your divine Father hath been made to flourish<br>
  through the union of the KA of Osiris Khenti-Amenti, whch ye effected,<br>
  and the Eye of Horus hath avenged him, and hath protected him, and<br>
  hath cast down headlong for him all his enemies, and all his enemies<br>
  have fallen down before him, even so do ye destroy the Opponent of the<br>
  Osiris Nu, the steward of the overseer of the seal, whose word is<br>
  truth. Let him live with the gods, let him smite his enemy, let him<br>
  destroy him, when light dawneth on the earth. Let Horus be master<br>
  and avenge the Osiris Nu, and let the Osiris Nu flourish through his<br>
  union with his KA which ye have effected. O Osiris Nu, the Eye of<br>
  Horus hath avenged thee. It hath cast down headlong all thine<br>
  enemies for thee, and all thine enemies have been cast down headlong<br>
  before thee.<br>
  Hail, Osiris Khenti-Amenti, grant thou light and fire to the perfect<br>
  Heart-soul which is in Hensu. And [O ye Sons of Horus], grant ye power<br>
  unto the living heart-soul of the Osiris Nu by means of his fire.<br>
  Let him not be repulsed, and let him not be driven back at the doors<br>
  of Amentet! Let his offerings of bread and of linen garments be<br>
  brought unto him among the lords of funeral oblations. O offer ye<br>
  praises, as unto a god to the Osiris Nu, the destroyer of his Opponent<br>
  in his form of Truth, and in his attributes of a god of truth.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: [This Chapter] shall be recited over four torches of atma<br>
  cloth, which hath been anointed with the finest Thehennu unguent,<br>
  and the torches shall be placed in the hands of four men who shall<br>
  have the names of the pillars of Horus written upon their shoulders,<br>
  and they shall burn the torches in the beautiful light of Ra, and this<br>
  shall confer power and might upon the Spirit-soul of the deceased<br>
  among the stars which never set. If this Chapter be recited for him he<br>
  shall never, never perish, and he shall become a living soul for ever.<br>
  These torches shall make the Spirit-soul to flourish like Osiris<br>
  Khenti-Amenti, regularly and continually for ever. It is a struggle.<br>
  Thou shalt not perform this ceremony before any human being except<br>
  thine own self, or thy father, or thy son, because it is an<br>
  exceedingly great mystery of the Amentet, and it is a type of the<br>
  hidden things of the Tuat. When this ceremony hath been performed<br>
  for the deceased, the gods, and the Spirit-souls, and the dead shall<br>
  see him in the form of Khenti-Amenti, and he shall have power and<br>
  dominion like this god.</p>
<p>If thou shalt undertake to perform for the deceased that which is<br>
  ordered in this &quot;Chapter of the four blazing torches,&quot; each day,<br>
  thou shalt cause the form of the deceased to come forth from every<br>
  hall [in the Tuat], and from the Seven Halls of Osiris. And he shall<br>
  live in the form of the God. He shall have power and dominion<br>
  corresponding to those of the gods and the Spirit-souls for ever and<br>
  ever. He shall enter in through the secret pylons and shall not be<br>
  turned back in the presence of Osiris. And it shall come to pass,<br>
  provided that the following things be done for him, that he shall<br>
  enter in and come forth. He shall not be turned back. No boundary<br>
  shall be set to his goings, and the sentence of the doom shall not<br>
  be passed upon him on the Day of the Weighing of Words before<br>
  Osiris- never, never.<br>
  And thou shalt perform whatsoever [is written in] this book on<br>
  behalf of the deceased, who shall thereby become perfect and pure. And<br>
  thou shalt &quot;open his mouth&quot; with the instrument of iron. And thou<br>
  shalt write down these things in accordance with the instructions<br>
  which are found in the books of Prince Herutataf, who discovered<br>
  them in a secret coffer (now they were in the handwriting of the god<br>
  [Thoth] himself and had been deposited in the Temple of the goddess<br>
  Unnut, the Lady of Unu) during a journey which he was making in<br>
  order to inspect the temples, and the temple-estates, and the<br>
  sanctuaries of the gods. And thou shalt perform these ceremonies<br>
  secretly in the Tuat-chamber of the tomb, for they are mysteries of<br>
  the Tuat, and they are symbolic of the things which are done in<br>
  Khert-Neter.<br>
  And thou shalt say: I have come, I have advanced hastily. I cast<br>
  light upon his (the deceased's) footsteps. I am hidden, but I cast<br>
  light upon his hidden place. I stand up close to the Tet. I stand up<br>
  close to the Tet of Ra, I turn back the slaughter. I am protecting<br>
  thee, O Osiris.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: This Chapter shall be recited over a Tet of crystal, which<br>
  shall be set upon a brick made of crude mud, whereupon this Chapter<br>
  hath been inscribed. Thou shalt make a cavity in the west wall [of the<br>
  tomb], and having turned the front of the Tet towards the east, thou<br>
  shalt wall up the cavity with mud which hath been mixed with extract<br>
  of cedar. This Tet shall drive away the enemies of Osiris who would<br>
  set themselves at the east wall [of the tomb].</p>
<p>And thou shalt say: I have driven back thy foes. I keep watch over<br>
  thee. He that is upon his mountain (Anpu) keepeth watch over thee<br>
  ready for the moment when thy foes shall attack thee, and he shall<br>
  repulse them for thee. I will drive back the Crocodile at the moment<br>
  when it attacketh thee, and I will protect thee, O Osiris Nu.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: This Chapter shall be recited over a figure of Anpu made<br>
  of crude mud mixed with incense. And the figure shall be set upon a<br>
  brick made of crude mud, whereupon this Chapter hath been inscribed.<br>
  Thou shalt make a cavity in the east wall, and having turned the<br>
  face of the figure of Anpu towards the west wall [therein] thou<br>
  shalt wall up the cavity. This figure shall repulse the enemies of<br>
  Osiris, who would set themselves at the south wall.</p>
<p>And thou shalt say; I am the belt of sand round about the hidden<br>
  coffer. I turn back the force of the blazing fire of the funerary<br>
  mountain. I traverse the roads, and I protect the Osiris Nu, the<br>
  steward of the overseer of the seal, whose word is truth.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: This Chapter shall be recited over a brick made of crude mud<br>
  whereon a copy of this Chapter hath been inscribed. And thou shalt<br>
  place a reed in the middle thereof, and thou shalt smear it with<br>
  pitch, and set light thereto. Then thou shalt make a cavity in the<br>
  south wall, and, having turned the front of the brick towards the<br>
  north, thou shalt wall the brick up inside it. [It shall repulse the<br>
  enemies of the Osiris Nu] who would assemble at the north wall.</p>
<p>And thou shalt say: O thou who comest to set fire [to the tomb or<br>
  mummy], I will not let thee do it. O thou who comest to cast fire<br>
  [herein], I will not let thee do it. I will burn thee, and I will cast<br>
  fire upon thee. I protect the Osiris Nu, the steward of the overseer<br>
  of the seal, whose word is truth.</p>
<p>RUBRIC: This Chapter shall be recited over a brick of crude mud,<br>
  whereon a copy of this Chapter hath been inscribed. [And thou shalt<br>
  set upon it] a figure of the deceased made of palm wood, seven fingers<br>
  in height. And thou shalt perform on it the ceremony of &quot;Opening the<br>
  Mouth.&quot; Then thou shalt make a cavity in the north wall, and having<br>
  [placed the brick and the figure inside it], and turned the face of<br>
  the figure towards the south, thou shalt wall up the cavity. [It shall<br>
  repulse the enemies of the Osiris Nu], who would assemble at the south<br>
  wall.</p>
<p>And behold, these things shall be done by a man who is washed clean,<br>
  and is ceremonially pure, and who hath eaten neither meat nor fish,<br>
  and who hath not [recently] had intercourse with women. And behold,<br>
  thou shalt make offerings of cakes and ale to these gods, and shalt<br>
  burn incense on their fires. Every Spirit-soul for whom these things<br>
  shall be done shall become like a holy god in Khert-Neter, and he<br>
  shall not be turned back at any gate in Amentet, and he shall be in<br>
  the following of Osiris, whithersoever he goeth, regularly and<br>
  continually.</p>
