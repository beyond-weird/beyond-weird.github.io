  <b><font color="#FFFFFF">Life forms so alien that scientists may simply not 
  have recognised evidence of their existence could inhabit the Earth, according 
  to a leading scientist. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Dr Tom Gold, emeritus professor of astronomy at Cornell 
  University in America, believes that organisms based on silicon - completely 
  unrelated to all the carbon-based life man has encountered so far - may live 
  at great depths. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> In a forthcoming book he will suggest that scientists 
  should take the possibility more seriously. Gold, who is a member of the Royal 
  Society, previously predicted that vast amounts of more conventional bacteria 
  live miles down within the Earth's crust. Scientists initially dismissed the 
  idea, but many now agree with him. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"So long as nobody suspects there could be silicon-based 
  life, we may just not be clever enough to identify it," he said last week. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Rocks bearing signs of silicon-based organisms may 
  already be sitting in laboratories, he believes, with their significance overlooked. 
  </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Every known living organism, from bacteria to mankind, 
  is based on the chemistry of carbon, which forms the complex molecules such 
  as DNA that are central to our existence. Scientists believe that if extraterrestrial 
  life is found, the chances are that it, too, will be carbon-based. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Silicon has many chemical similarities to carbon, 
  prompting scholars and science fiction writers to dream up new life forms. Huge 
  "space slugs" that can swallow space ships appear in the film <I>The Empire 
  Strikes Back</I>; in an episode of <I>Star Trek</I> a rock-like alien attacked 
  Captain Kirk's crew; and killer parasites based on silicon surfaced in <I>The 
  X-Files</I> when scientists explored the interior of a volcano. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Gold's life forms, if they exist, would most likely 
  be micro-organisms capable of withstanding enormous pressures and temperatures, 
  living in tiny pores inside rock deep within the Earth's crust. They could draw 
  energy from dissolved gases and surrounding minerals. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Gold's ideas, which centre on an alternative explanation 
  for oil and mineral deposits, will be published in his book, The Deep Hot Biosphere, 
  in January. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"It is speculative but logical that there could be 
  a large bio-chemical system very deep down which works better at high temperatures 
  and pressures," he said. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Others are sceptical. Dr Harold Klein, who headed 
  the Viking lander project team that searched for signs of life on Mars in the 
  1970s, pointed out that silicon was far inferior to carbon at forming the complex 
  polymers crucial for life. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"I personally doubt the idea of silicon-based life. 
  If we do find organisms far down inside the Earth, I'd bet they'd be carbon-based," 
  he said. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Nevertheless, he urges future missions to Mars to 
  carry an instrument to test for non-carbon-based organisms - just in case. It 
  is possible that the chemistry of silicon is altered sufficiently by the great 
  temperatures and pressures deep in the Earth to make it more suited to forming 
  complex molecules, according to David Noever, a research scientist at Nasa's 
  new Astrobiology Institute. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> He said some scientists at the American space agency 
  were treating the idea of silicon-based organisms seriously, particularly with 
  a view to searching for extraterrestrial life. </font></b>
<P> <b><font color="#FFFFFF">"It's almost naive to assume all life must be carbon-based; 
  I could possibly make good cases for life based on both silicon and phosphorus," 
  he said. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Silicon is used by some carbon-based single-cell 
  organisms called diatoms to form protective shells, according to Dr David Williams, 
  a diatom researcher at the Natural History Museum in London. But diatoms are 
  still fundamentally carbon-based. </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> However, bizarre organisms have been found in recent 
  years deep in the Earth's crust. Steve Jones, professor of genetics at University 
  College London, said: "There's an unknown universe down there that has already 
  produced organisms with metabolisms so strange that, by comparison, man and 
  mushrooms are almost identical, so God knows what else they'll find." </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Microbes have been found living on the ocean floor 
  at depths and temperatures where life was previously thought unsustainable. 
  </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Without knowing what silicon-based life forms might 
  be like, said Dr Harry Elderfield, an earth scientist at Cambridge University, 
  it is almost impossible to predict how scientists could even test for them. 
  </font></b>
<P><b><font color="#FFFFFF"> Yet Gold has been described by Stephen Jay Gould, 
  president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, as one 
  of the most iconoclastic scientists - but one who is often right. </font></b>
