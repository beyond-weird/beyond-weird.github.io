LETTER FROM GENE TATUM TO ROSS PEROT
====================================
 
August 1, 1996
 
Mr. Ross Perot
12377 Merit Drive, Suite 1700
Dallas, Texas  75251
 
Dear Mr. Perot:
 
Please find the accompanying  copy  of "The Tatum Chronicles".  I
call your attention to pages 42 through 46.  On March 24, 1985, I
was tasked to fly several passengers to El  Ocotal,  Costa  Rica.
Among  those  present  were  William  Barr  (future  US  Attorney
General),  General  Manuel  Noriega (Panamanian military leader),
General Gustavo  Alverez  (Honduran  Army  Chief  of  Staff), Joe
Fernandez  (CIA),  Mike  Harari  (Mossad),  and  Felix  Rodreguiz
(CIA). 
 
During the meeting, the discussion centered around a large amount
of drugs and money missing from Lt. Col.  Oliver  North's  Contra
drug  manufacturing "Enterprise".  Three distribution points were
discussed:  Ohio, Arkansas, and  Colorado.   The Colorado leg was
discounted as being the source  of  the  loss.   Next,  Ohio  was
discounted.   It  was  determined that the Panama to Arkansas leg
was where the drugs and money  were missing.  A call was made via
SATCOM to the Governor of Arkansas concerning the loss. 
 
This, in itself, should not be a concern to you  or  your  party,
but  as  I  told  you  in  my  letter  dated April 20, 1996, Vice
President  Bush  was  concerned  about  the  Reform  Party  being
contrary to the interests  of  America.   The order to neutralize
you was given to me.  Now this is not normally the first step  in
our  process.   Normally,  Vice  President Bush would exhaust all
diplomatic means before ordering Pegasus on the job.  I must ask,
was there an attempt  to  diplomatically  resolve your starting a
new party?  Only you can answer this.  Because if there was,  you
are  obviously  stalwart in your stand to organize a third party,
Bush be damned. 
 
I believe that Mr. Bush has continued his attempt to  thwart  the
formation and success of the Reform Party via political sabotage.
When  I  refused  to  carry  out  the  neutralization  order  and
threatened  to  disclose  the  documents  in my possession, which
would destroy several major  political  figures, he was forced to
take a different course of action.   Look  at  page  43  of  "The
Chronicles".   Who  do you think the overseer of the Colorado leg
of the "Enterprise" was?   I  would reasonably assume that, since
the Arkansas leg  was  run  by  the  governor  of  Arkansas,  the
Colorado  leg  was  run  by  the governor of Colorado.  So then I
would ask, who  was  the  governor  of  Colorado  in 1985?  If my
memory serves me correctly, Richard Lamm was Colorado's  governor
from  1974  through  1986.  Now, suddenly, from nowhere, Mr. Lamm
has mustered support and  announced  his candidacy in your Reform
Party.  And is further demanding that you step aside  and  let  a
third entity manage the party.
 
Oh what tangled webs we weave.  Beware my friend, and good luck.
 
As always, true to America
 
D.G. "Chip" Tatum
