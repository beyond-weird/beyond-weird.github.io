THE MANNLICHER-CARCANO BOMB
===========================
 
David Hoffman, author of  a  forthcoming  book *The Oklahoma City
Bombing and the Politics of Terror*, offers the following preview
of his work-in-progress.  Hoffman says his book will be published
by Feral House, probably in late  1997.   Hoffman  publishes  the
Haight  Ashbury Free Press, and has temporarily moved to Oklahoma
City to work on this book.
 
  ...Was   the   BATF   in  fact  responsible,  knowingly  or
  unknowingly,  for  the  explosion that destroyed the Murrah
  building?  Consider the following article which appeared in
  the June 5, 1995 issue of Newsweek:
 
  "For the  past  year,  the  BATF  and  the  Army  Corps  of
  Engineers have been blowing up car bombs at the White Sands
  Proving Ground in  New  Mexico.   The  project,  code-named
  Dipole Might, is designed to create  a  computer  model  to
  unravel   terrorist   car-and   truck-bomb   attacks.    By
  coincidence,  a  BATF  agent   assigned  to  Dipole  Might,
  happened to be in Oklahoma  City  on April 19th, working at
  the Federal Courthouse, which stands across the street from
  the Murrah Building.  He saw the devastation and called the
  BATF office in Dallas.  The Murrah Building had  just  been
  hit by 'ANFO' (ammonium material)  bomb of at least several
  thousand pounds, he  reported.   Within minutes, explosives
  agents trained under Dipole Might were  dispatched  to  the
  scene.   They  identified  the  type  and  size of the bomb
  almost immediately."
 
  Just  how  this  agent  (Harry  Everhart)   was   able   to
  immediately ascertain the building had been blown up by  an
  ANFO  bomb,  when  no   forensic   analysis  had  yet  been
  conducted, is unclear.   When  Phil O'Halloran, a freelance
  journalist,  attempted  to  ask  the  BATF Public Relations
  Bureau why a Dipole Might expert just happened to be in the
  courthouse at that moment, and  how  he  could  immediately
  have known the exact nature of the bomb, O'Halloran, rather
  than be  given  a  rational  explanation,  was  accused  of
  attacking the agency and was promised a fax of agency views
  on right-wing conspiracists (which never arrived)....
 
  It also seems that  the  "coincidence" of the BATF's Dipole
  Might  tests  were  uncannily  similar  to the May 24, 1990
  bombing  of  Earth  First!  activist  Judi  Bari.   The FBI
  claimed that Bari and her companion Daryl Cherney, who were
  on their way to a peaceful protest rally, had inadvertently
  blown themselves up with their own pipe-bomb.
 
  After Bari sued the FBI for false arrest and  civil  rights
  violations, she found out  through court discovery that the
  FBI ran a "bomb school" at Eureka College of  the  Redwoods
  in  April  of  1990  for  both  FBI  and local police.  The
  classes  included  blowing   up   cars   with  pipe  bombs,
  ostensibly to demonstrate tactics used by  terrorists  (the
  same  reason  cited  in the BATF case).  The instructor for
  this "school of terrorism" was  none other than Frank Doyle
  Jr., the FBI bomb squad expert who showed up at  the  scene
  of Bari's car bombing one month later.
 
  According  to  Freedom  of  Information  Act  records,  the
  Treasury  Department's  (BATF   is   under   the   Treasury
  Department)  Project  Dipole  Might  was  actually initated
  under  the  authorization  of  Clinton's  National Security
  Council.  One of the  stated  purposes  of the Dipole Might
  project was to produce  computer  models of bombings to "be
  displayed  in  a  courtroom  to  aid  in the prosecution of
  defendants."  Naturally,  the  Justice  Department plans on
  using the video tapes shot  at White Sands during the trial
  of McVeigh and Nichols to "prove" that an ANFO bomb blew up
  the building.  As Lawrence Myers, writing in  Media  Bypass
  magazine wrote:
 
    Why  the National Security Council would fund such an
    ATF  project,  despite  the  absolute  rarity  of the
    crime, has not  been  explained.   Nor  has  it  been
    explained  as  to  what  specific  threat  assessment
    information the government had  when  it  decided  to
    engage in such a project,  just a few months before a
    Ryder Truck laden  with  ammonium-nitrate  fertilizer
    exploded in front of the Murrah Building.
 
  As  Myers  points  out, the last-known case of a truck bomb
  exploding  in  the  U.S.  was  in  1970,  when an ANFO bomb
  exploded in front of the ROTC building at the University of
  Wisconsin,  in  Madison.   Why  then,  would  the  National
  Security  Council  suddenly  feel  the  need  for  detailed
  information regarding ANFO truck-bomb attacks?
 
  Was the BATF expecting such a bombing.  Were they  in  fact
  responsible for  blast  or  the  secondary  damage  to  the
  building?  Or was the building wired for demolition as part
  of a larger plot?
 
  "I'm firmly convinced that the  BATF  is guilty of an awful
  lot  of  things,"  said Bud, our ex-Green Beret friend.  "I
  mean, if you look at what the BATF and the FBI did to Randy
  Weaver (and at Waco),  it's  just  awful.  They've gone hog
  wild and have [become] a power unto themselves."
 
  Asked if he thought  a  rogue  group or special unit within
  the  military/intelligence  community could or would commit
  such an act?
 
  "It wouldn't really stun me," said Bud.
