SOVIET 'SLEEPERS.'
 
WHOSE BED ARE THEY IN NOW?
 
During  the  Cold  War,  'sleepers'  were  a  prime concern to US
intelligence.  But after the  Berlin  Wall came tumbling down, no
one seemed bothered enough to find out if they had all packed  up
and gone home

  THE GUATEMALAN ATROCITIES:
  The CIA has admitted it had credible evidence that its Guatemalan
  military assets were involved in assassinations, but is there a
  whole lot more that's known by the U.S. intelligence community
  that hasn't been disclosed?

  TWA FLIGHT 800:
  Sifting through the possibilities, mechanical failure looks less
  and less likely
       
  REFORMING INTELLIGENCE
  After its grand send off, intelligence reform sputters out broken
  down on a road full of bureaucratic potholes and institutional
  speed bumps...
       
  ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO
  SOMETHING CERTAINLY CRASHED THERE 50 YEARS AGO
  Whether it was a Flying Saucer, a still-secret black operation
  gone awry, or something else, the Air Force explanation doesn't
  hold up and the mystery is still a mystery
       
  CONFESSIONS OF A CIA BRAT
  Twenty years after his retirement from the CIA, I asked my father,
  Dr. Joseph B. Johnston, for the umpteenth time, what he did for
  the government all these years. "I don't recall," was his answer,
  as it always had been. I once read that being lied to consistently
  and systematically could make a sane person crazy. Maybe I'm
  crazy, then.

  THE PENTAGON PREPARES FOR WAR AGAINST WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
  Now that the Cold War is over, military planners have made
  stopping the spread of the weapons of the apocalypse their top
  priority
