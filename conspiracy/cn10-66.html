Tokyo  --  Japanese employers are allegedly killing some of their
unproductive workers.  Here is  how  the "termination" process is
said to work:  Workers get evaluated every six months.  If  their
rating  is  too  low, they are put on probation.  If a subsequent
rating  remains  sub-standard,  the  employee  is  summoned  to a
special office.  It is suggested to him that the "honorable"  act
he  must  do is jump out the window, to his death.  If he refuses
to cooperate, security guards are summoned and, reportedly, he is
thrown out the window. (WWN, 5/27/97)
