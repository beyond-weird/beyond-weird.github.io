  COL. RUSSELL HERMAN *NOT* ACTIVE IN GOVT.-CONDONED DRUG DEALS
  =============================================================
            Mrs. Russell Herman Responds to Allegations
            -------------------------------------------
 
Regarding allegations made  by  "Mr.  Mercedes" (pseudonym) in CN
9.97, to whit that
 
  "Big Al" Carone was the "bagman" for NYPD,  friend  of  DCI
  Bill  Casey,  and  "banker"  for  the  CIA's  drugs op from
  1946-80  (died  of  "CIA  flu"),  along with other "bagmen"
  associates, Russell Herman (also died  of  "CIA  flu")  and
  "fixer/briber"  Al  Hobert and NYPD "dirty" cop Gene Howard
  who were all "on the take,"
 
Mrs. Russell Herman, widow of the late Col. Herman, responds:
 
  Did Col. Russell Herman  have  an  active part in the DRUGS
  with BUSH, NORTH, Greenspan, Baker, Bentsen, Inyoue, Meese,
  Colby,  Casey,  etc?   *Highly*  *doubtful*.   *He*   *was*
  *highly*  *opposed*  *to* *any* *form* *of* *DRUGS*, *even*
  *an* *ASPIRIN*.
 
In my September 13, 1995  interview  with retired NYPD Vice Squad
Detective Jimmy Rothstein (see especially CN 6.10 and  CN  6.18),
the now private investigator mentioned Russell Herman:
 
  We  also  know,  there's  a thing that just appeared in the
  National Enquirer wherein  they're  knocking  a  guy by the
  name of Russell Herman.   And  we  know that Russell Herman
  met *with* [Vince]  Foster  at  a  truck  stop  outside  of
  Marion,  Illinois.   And the widow of this Herman has given
  us that information.   And  they  also,  at times, met with
  others.  See, we know that Russell Herman and a guy by  the
  name of Al Carone were money-men -- carriers, movers.  See,
  this is somethin' that nobody else knows about:  but one of
  the people they met with was Foster!
 
Mrs.  Herman,  understandably  upset  at  what  she  perceived as
misrepresentation,  responded  to   this   portion  of  Detective
Rothstein's remarks (CN 6.17):
 
  "It is not known by me, what  Mr.  Rothstein  is  sniffing,
  inhaleing  or puffing, however this is most assuredly not a
  conversation  which  was   held   between  Myself  and  Mr.
  Rothstein -- at anytime.  I  have  had  a  talk  with  this
  individual, and my talk was about:  TELLING A DAMMED LIE!
 
  After talking to Mr.  Rothstein,  advising  him of his mis-
  information  he  was requested to "get the story straight,"
  and  that  he  was  to  quit selling information on Russell
  Herman, as the information  which  he  is  distributing  is
  "deliberate dis- information.
 
Contacted  by me, Rothstein expressed puzzlement at Mrs. Herman's
anger.  He felt he  had  accurately reported information given to
him by her.  Mrs. Herman claimed (CN 6.17) to have  tape-recorded
at least some of  her  conversations  with Rothstein and that she
could "prove what was said."
 
Providing  further  background  to  the  Herman  story  are   the
following   remarks   from   my  September  13,  1995  interview.
According  to  Rothstein,  Russell  Herman  had  inside financial
knowledge related to alleged CIA shady operations:
 
  See, there's only a couple of guys that  know  about  these
  accounts and stuff.  And they have a lot of money  stashed.
  This is why I give some credibility about some of the stuff
  that's  coming  out  on  Foster, about his involvement with
  this money.
 
  Again, if this sounds like it's all spread out all over the
  place,  it's  not.   When  you follow Al Carone and Russell
  Herman, you're right back to Inslaw and PROMIS software and
  all these people.  It always ends up,  as  you  go  up  the
  ladder, you'll find there's,  like,  forty,  fifty  people.
  And  I  don't care what end of this you look at, you always
  end up with these same people.
 
  I also  know  that  [Michael]  Riconosciuto  and some other
  people had access.  Because we have  found  some  of  these
  accounts.   And under Russell Herman and Al Carone, there's
  more accounts that  we  actually  have  the  names of.  The
  Anschbacher accounts, is one of the  big  money  laundering
  accounts.
 
For my part I  wish  to  stress  that  this dispute between Jimmy
Rothstein and Mrs. Herman is a developing story,  with  no  clear
indication  as to which of the parties to the dispute is the more
credible.  As always, I leave  it  to the reader to either decide
or to await further developments.

Contacted by  Mrs.  Herman  subsequent  to  mention  of  her late
husband in the article by "Mr. Mercedes," she informed me that  a
copy  of a letter written by her was enroute to my address.  Here
are portions of that letter:
 
  REF: "Conspiracy Nation -- Vol. 9 Num. 97."
 
  Last evening I received  the above referenced article.  You
  were in error when you identified Russell Herman along with
  the "Drug and Money Laundering of the CIA."  Yes, Rusty was
  with the CIA.  He was U.S. Armed Forces  Intelligence.   He
  started  out  in  the Merchant Marines when he was 13 years
  old.  His mother  lied  about  his  age.   She had too many
  mouths to feed.  Putting him in the Merchant Marines  as  I
  understood  it  was getting him off the [Al] CAPONE streets
  and into an environment where he could get an education and
  stay out of trouble.
 
  I believe it  was  April  of  1940  he entered the Merchant
  Marines, then on Dec. 7,  1941  Pearl  Harbor  was  bombed.
  President  Roosevelt  by Executive Order moved the Merchant
  Marines into  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard.   Later by Executive
  Order he placed the U.S. Coast Guard, Navy, Army  into  the
  United States Land and Naval Forces.  Then Korea broke out.
  We had a "Police Action," so they say.  By that time, Harry
  Truman had put him [Russell Herman] in the OSS, which later
  became  the  OSI then the CIA.  Rusty was a personal friend
  of Harry Truman's.  He  admired  Mr.  Truman  to the day he
  died. 
 
  President Reagan, after becoming President, pulled off  the
  Iran-Contra  arms  deal.   The  "Contra  Arms" involves and
  involved more than just Iran.  It involved selling arms (by
  the U.S. government)  to  our  sister  nations  here on the
  American continent.
 
  Banking had to be set up.  Banking facilitations  were  put
  into   action  by  the  Inter-American  Alliance  Agreement
  (Treaty) in (I think) 1984.   It  is documented in the U.S.
  Government Document Library.
 
  "Rusty," doing  his  "duty"  for  his  "country,"  per  the
  instructions  of the President of the United States, worked
  with Alan  Greenspan  (while  still  located  in  his Texas
  Federal Reserve  position),  George  Bush,  Ed  Meese,  Dan
  Inyoue,  Oliver North, William Casey, William Colby, Robert
  Carderia, Dr. "Q," and others.
 
  The  Federal  Reserve   (Greenspan)  utilized  the  banking
  co-ordinances between Republic National Bank of Texas,  and
  Republic  National  Bank  of  New York, for the Anschbacher
  Account:  "CI-Ltd."   (Central  Intelligence  Ltd.)  in the
  Jersey/Guernsey Islands.  The account number is  608103047.
  The  bank  officer  for  handling the "CI-Ltd." account was
  Terrence (Teddy) Lloyd.
 
  As understood by me,  this  is  the Woodbridge Account.  It
  (according to U.S. Col. Russell Herman) holds  the  "Contra
  monies."   I  do  not  know if it is the Iran-Contra or the
  Central American Contra monies,  he  just stated it was the
  Contra Arms monies due the men for their services.
 
  According to Col. Herman, the account can only be  accessed
  by voice and fingerprints.
 
  Did Col. Russell Herman  have  an  active part in the DRUGS
  with BUSH, NORTH, Greenspan, Baker, Bentsen, Inyoue, Meese,
  Colby,  Casey,  etc?   *Highly*  *doubtful*.   *He*   *was*
  *highly*  *opposed*  *to* *any* *form* *of* *DRUGS*, *even*
  *an* *ASPIRIN*.
