      "Investigative Reports" "Examines" Vince Foster Death
      -----------------------------------------------------
                       (A&E, October 5, 1996)
 
First PBS's "Frontline" bites the  dust.  Then "60 Minutes" loses
face.  Now Bill Kurtis, host for "Investigative  Reports,"  konks
out.
 
A  portion  of the October 5, 1996 "investigative report" dealing
with the late Vince Foster  showed the pain that Foster's friends
and family are enduring due to  a  "small  but  vocal"  group  of
"conspiracy  theorists"  who keep raising questions.  Advised one
Foster friend to "conspiracy theorists" -- "Get a life."
 
"Oh  it's  the  mystery.   Americans  love  a  mystery."   That's
supposedly why Vince Foster is not resting in peace.
 
Says a representative from the New York Times:  "Oh we would love
to have a real story  about  a  murder  at that high of a level."
So, it seems, obviously there's no cover  up  or  else  New  York
Times would be hot on the trail.
 
Also  seriously put forward by the "investigative report" was the
idea that, because there are so many anomalies connected with the
Foster death, then obviously  there's  not  a cover-up; if a real
cover-up  was  occuring,  so  many  glaring  inconsistencies  and
supposed screw-ups by investigators wouldn't have happened.   Get
it  straight:   only  if the case had lacked its doubtful aspects
could we  assume  that  something  fishy  was  going  on  -- real
cover-up artists wouldn't have made so  many  mistakes.   Or  so,
with a straight face, suggests the "investigative report."
 
Three  Park  Police  were shown at Fort Marcy Park discussing the
case.  Two of the three, all of  whom had been among the first to
arrive at the scene that July 20th, wore  uniforms.   Officer  #1
says  he took photos that day, but they came out bad.  Officer #2
says he took Polaroid  photos,  but  he  lost  many of them.  The
doctor who performed the autopsy couldn't take  x-rays  for  some
reason;  apparently  his  x-ray  machine wasn't working that day.
But, according to the  view presented by "Investigative Reports,"
it's all an innocent coincidence feeding the  fevered  brains  of
"conspiracy theorists."
 
Not  really  covered  by  "Investigative  Reports" was the expert
handwriting analysis showing the  so-called "Foster suicide note"
is a forgery.  Not covered  was  that  no  skull  fragments  from
Foster's exploding cranium were found at the scene.  Not answered
for  were the carpet fibers on Foster's clothing nor the pristine
condition of his shoes.
 
Why didn't recoil  from  the  pistol  throw  it away from Foster?
Park Police say the thumb got caught in the trigger  guard.   Why
no  fingerprints  on the pistol?  Something to do with the pistol
not conducive to retaining prints.  Why  the lack of blood at the
scene?  The "investigative report"  suggests  the  heart  stopped
pumping  and  also  that what blood there was got soaked into the
ground.  (But why did the trail of blood on Foster's face flow in
three different directions, including uphill?)
 
Given  minor  air  time  were Hugh Sprunt, Reed Irvine, G. Gordon
Liddy, and Ambrose  Evans-Pritchard.   Given  plenty  of air time
were the Park Police (two in handsome uniforms and all three shot
at least once from a camera angle designed to  make  them  appear
quite  large  indeed.)  Also given plenty of sympathetic coverage
were grieving  Foster  friends  (guitar  softly  strumming in the
background) made to suffer the cruelty of "conspiracy theorists."
Conclusion?  These "conspiracy theorists" aren't after the truth,
they're sickos and sadists.
 
Congrats to Bill Kurtis  on  a  slick  P.R. job meant to persuade
amateurs that Foster became suicidal due  to  Washington  stress.
To  the  underinformed  (underinformed  thanks  to "investigative
reports" like yours, Bill)  your  program came across as possibly
an honest search for the truth.  To this editor, among a minority
that somehow has gained access to more  of  the  facts  --  facts
which indisputably show Foster did *not* commit suicide where his
body was found -- Bill Kurtis has revealed his true colors.
