THE DE-CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
==================================
Visit site: https://https://.dcia.com
 
   This  site   exposes   the   largest   China  White  Heroin
   trafficking operation in the UNITED STATES.  The murders of
   9 Buddhists at Wat Promkunaram Temple in 1991 were  clearly
   related.  Systemic narcotics corruption is revealed in many
   layers  of  Arizona government.  Major media imposed a news
   blackout while law  enforcement  fabricated  a case against
   teenagers known to be  innocent.   A  textbook  example  of
   D.O.D.  drug  trafficking  is presented.  More intelligence
   fronts propagandizing the American  public are exposed here
   than anywhere  else.   The  business  aspects  of  war  are
   discussed.   Economic crimes of less than $200 million will
   probably not interest us.

                   SCANDAL HAUNTS TEMPLE MURDERS
                                      
   In THAILAND the 1991 murders of 9 Buddhists in a temple  on
   the  far west side of Phoenix, Arizona was called "the most
   heinous crime in 2,500  years  of Buddhism."  In the UNITED
   STATES the most disturbing aspects of this  gruesome  crime
   have been blacked out by major media.

   It is not every day that a small country finds the  courage
   to  evict  persona  non  grata the U.S. Ambassador, the CIA
   Station Chief, Oliver  North,  and  George  Bush CIA buddy,
   Felix Rodregez for multiple  counts  of  illegal  narcotics
   trafficking and gun running.

   High  schools and universities teach the fairy tale version

   can  have  your  knowledge  of  how the world is really run
   evaluated, receive guided reading assignments and have your
