PRAIRIENET "FREE NET" MOVES TO SQUELCH DISSENT
==============================================
 
Although burning with anger at  the  moment, I will try to calmly
explain bullying tactics used and apparently in the works against
this alternative news outlet by a person or persons at this  time
unknown  to  me  who  go  by the alias of "The Prairienet Systems
Staff."
 
This entity, "The Prairienet  Systems  Staff,"  has denied me due
process by (a) receiving an  allegation  that  I  have  "spammed"
someone,  i.e.,  apparently  meaning  I  have sent an unsolicited
e-mail message or messages to  an Internet user, then (b) finding
me guilty of the charge, without EVER bothering to hear  my  side
of  the  allegation,  and finally (c) issuing a ruling that if it
happens one more time, my account can be cancelled.
 
If my Prairienet  account  is  cancelled,  this  will (a) greatly
limit this news service's ability to  disseminate  controversial,
alternative  information  and  (b) presumably also mean that news
archives compiled  by  this  alternative  news  service  and made
available as a public and patriotic service, and  at  no  charge,
will  no  longer be available.  Specifically, it can be seen that
the  cancellation  of  my  Prairienet  account  will  likely also
eliminate the public archives at the "Citizens Committee to Clean
Up the Courts" site ("go citcom") on Prairienet.
 
Also suffering  due  to  this  possible  arrogant  outrage  being
apparently  planned  by  a person or persons unknown at this time
and operating  under  the  alias  "The  Prairienet Systems Staff"
would  be  Mr.  Sherman  Skolnick,  Chairman  and Founder of "The
Citizen's Committee to Clean Up  the  Courts."  Mr. Skolnick is a
well-known investigator, operating in  the  public  interest  for
three  decades,  whose  work is widely read worldwide.  The great
majority of material to be  found  at the "Citizen's Committee to
Clean Up the Courts" archive on Prairienet is  by  Mr.  Skolnick.
Thus,  Mr.  Skolnick would also be injured by possible censorship
being secretly planned by a person  or persons using the alias of
"The Prairienet Systems Staff," and acting under the disguise  of
preventing alleged "spamming."
 
Said  "spamming"  allegations are strongly denied by this editor.
I never  send  unsolicited  e-mail.   What  is  more,  I have not
conducted mass mailings from the Prairienet account  for  several
months,  at  least.   What  is  more, all those on the Conspiracy
Nation mailing list,  which  is  sent  from  a different Internet
account and not from the Prairienet account,  are  on  that  list
because  they  themselves  have signed onto it.  It is never this
editor's policy to subscribe  persons  himself; all such requests
receive  the  standard  response  that  the  user  himself   must
subscribe.   Furthermore,  any  user  is  free  to  cancel  their
subscription at any time.
 
Speculation  on the part of this editor leads him to believe that
the Prairienet "Free Net"  system,  a non-profit entity supported
in part by corporate monies,  in  part  by  user  donations,  and
presumably  also  receiving  federal  and/or state monies, may be
under some pressure to pull  the plug on the "Citizen's Committee
to Clean Up the Courts" archives on Prairienet.  It is well-known
that Prairienet lacks funding.  It is not impossible that certain
corporate and business entities, as well as certain narrow-minded
citizens, are using the hint or threat of cutbacks in funding  by
them as a means to silence this independent news outlet.  So too,
Illinois  government  officials  and agencies, as well as federal
government officials and agencies, who are critically scrutinized
by this news outlet,  have  it  in  their  power  to use hints or
threats of decreased  funding  to  attempt  to  silence  dissent.
Furthermore,  the  very unknown person or persons operating under
the alias of "The  Prairienet  Systems Staff" may themselves wish
to silence me by using false, trumped-up charges as an excuse  to
shut down points of view they do not like.
 
See  below  for  additional information.  Note especially that if
the entity  calling  itself  "The  Prairienet  Systems Staff" had
carefully  checked,  they  could  have  seen  that  the  supposed
"spamming" had as its destination two NEWSGROUPS, "alt.activism,"
and "alt.conspiracy," and not any individual's e-mail account.
