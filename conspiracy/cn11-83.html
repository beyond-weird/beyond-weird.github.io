THUS SPAKE THE RAVEN
====================
By Rayelan Russbacher
---------------------

I am sending you the  personal biography that Gunther wrote while
he was in prison here in the United States.  He titled it

Thus Spake The Raven....

His code name in the CIA was the Raven.  When we were in  Austria
this  is  the name he gave the Langley operator to gain access to
the people at CIA headquarters with whom he wanted to speak.

After the gold transfer  was  complete,  we called Langley again,
trying to figure out why  he  had  been  reactivated  (supposedly
because  of  the  Haiti crisis) when we had been promised that we
could move to Europe and  fade  into the woodwork of post coldwar
spies.  When we tried to get through  the  Langley  operator,  we
were  told  that  there was no "Raven".  It had been deactivated.
In other words, they  sent  us  a  message  that  now that we had
risked our lives taking the gold  home,  they  no  longer  needed
us... so we were throw away people.

In  this  little story he wrote, he does mention the fact that he
is married to me.  Gunther and  I  married in Reno, on August 30,
1989..... eight years later Princess Diana was  murdered  on  our
anniversary.   You  will  see  that Gunther gives his birthday as
July 1, 1942....  Diana was born July 1!!!

She was born on  his  birthday,  she  was murdered on his wedding
anniversary.  Everyone who knows about the workings of the covert
world of spies, knows that they like to send each  other  cryptic
messages by using the date they choose for their operation.

An  example  of this:  The October Surprise deal was finalized on
Hallowe'en...  October  31st  1980....  one  year after President
Carter  fired  700  CIA  covert  spies.   This  was  called  "The
Hallowe'en Massacre."  Carter was being sent a message.

(I will soon be faxing you a short note I wrote detailing how  we
married  and  how  I  discovered, on our wedding day, that he was
more than the Naval officer I had know for years.)

Not only did Gunther marry me  in  Reno, but five years later, he
took me to the church in Sekirchen, Austria....  outside  of  his
home  of Salzburg... and we were remarried at the foot of the red
marble altar.... one thousand years  old...  on which he had been
born.  The altar was in a lower dome shaped room in the church...
it was called the crypt.  Gunther told me that the grand  masters
of  the  Knights  Templars were buried in the walls.  The wedding
ceremony was something out of the archaic past.

The priest pulled his large crucifix out of his belt.  I then saw
that the cross was more  than  just  a cross.  He pulled it apart
and it became a dagger.  He asked for  our  wedding  rings.   The
rings  themselves contain symbols that Gunther told me could only
be worn by Knights Templars and  their mates.  The priest put the
rings on a silver plate and sprinkled them with holy water.  Then
he placed them on the blade of the dagger and passed them through
the incense flame.  Then he held them in the flame of a candle.

He took the rings off the dagger and replaced them on the  silver
tray.   Then  he  placed the dagger on the palm of Gunther's hand
and Gunther squeezed the blade.   A small paper type cut appeared
on the palm of his hand.  The  dagger was then placed in the palm
of my hand, a similar, small cut appeared on my palm.  The priest
then put our hands together.

The  priest  recited a ceremony in German, I do not speak German.
Then Gunther was handed my ring,  which he placed on my hand, and
I was handed his ring which I placed on his hand.   The  ceremony
was then complete and we left the crypt.

According to Rodney Stich, Gunther took Jane  back  to  the  same
church were we were re-married, and he had that marriage anulled.
That  would  be  the  second  marriage  [he] had annulled in that
church.  Even as modern  as  Catholic  churches have become...  I
don't know of many men who  are  fortunate  enough  to  have  two
marriages  anulled  by  the  church.   I  also  thought  that the
anullment had to be accompanied by  a civil divorce.  Am I wrong?
Or do they do things in Europe differently than we do them here?

I don't have any answers.  I am just now awaking from an 8  years
nightmare.    If  you  have  any  comments  that  might  help  me
understand what I have been through  and who I was really married
to, I would appreciate it.
