BYE-BYE WILLIAM J?
==================
 
[CN: I spoke with Sherman Skolnick on August 4, 1996.]
 
CONSPIRACY NATION:
You heard that Bill Clinton had a meeting recently?
 
 
SHERMAN SKOLNICK:
Within the last couple of days,  there was a meeting, arranged by
Robert Strauss, an  elder  statesman  of  the  Democratic  Party,
together  with  other  leading Democrats.  They told Clinton that
they had been informed by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
that Hillary, most likely if  not  for certain, would be indicted
between the Democratic convention at the end of  August  and  the
November  Presidential  election.   Strauss told Clinton (this is
according to Strauss's friends) that the Democrats do not want an
"October Surprise" that  could  bring  down  the Democratic Party
with Clinton; they want  him  to  resign,  two  days  before  the
Democratic convention.
 
They  intend  to  put  up two people that they feel would be more
suitable to the convention  and  the voters:  John D. Rockefeller
IV (of course, he's known as Jay Rockefeller),  and  possibly  Al
Gore, depending how the public perceives whether Gore is so close
to  Clinton  or  not.   If  not  Gore, then a running mate on the
ticket would be John Kerry.
 
The "October  Surprise"  situation  is,  if  an  indictment comes
against Hillary after September (assuming  that  Clinton  becomes
the  nominee  at  the  convention),  it  becomes an unprecedented
situation.  What will happen  to  Democrats running for Congress?
Or for Senate?
 
 
CONSPIRACY NATION:
So we can look for  the  press  to  be  stepping  up  attacks  on
Clinton, these next few weeks?
 
 
SHERMAN SKOLNICK:
Probably  so.   However,  there  are  legal  problems.  Strauss's
friends are not  convinced  that  Clinton  exactly  made a candid
statement that he *is* going to do as he's been  ordered  to  do,
that  is,  resign.   They  can  embarrass  him, of course, by not
making him the nominee at  the  convention.  The other problem is
legal:  *were* he to resign and he  becomes  a  private  citizen,
then  if  Hillary  *does* get indicted (as Kenneth Starr has told
Strauss) then Clinton himself can be named as a co-defendant with
his wife.  He only has  immunity from prosecution, under the U.S.
Constitution, as long as he remains  in  office.   You  can  only
remove a U.S. President by way of impeachment; that's all you can
do  to  him.   You  cannot  prosecute  him.  (At least that's the
interpretation of that provision of the Constitution.)
 
 
CONSPIRACY NATION:
So is Clinton going to fight this?
 
 
SHERMAN SKOLNICK:
Well...  Some at the meeting were concerned that the strange wave
of  violence  may  not  be   accidental,  that  somebody  may  be
orchestrating that, because it seems to support keeping those  in
office.
 
From  all  that I know, I think that Clinton will in fact resign.
He's under a tremendous pressure all  the way around!  I mean, if
he resigns he may go to jail.
 
 
CONSPIRACY NATION:
Okay.  There's another "elder statesman" that  made  a  statement
recently:   Barry Goldwater made the statement that he likes Bill
Clinton, and the only way that  he  would vote for Bob Dole would
be if Dole was the *only* candidate running for office.   To  me,
that  seems  like  a  *really*  major  statement:  he's the elder
statesman of the Republican Party  and he's turning "thumbs down"
on Dole.
 
 
SHERMAN SKOLNICK:
Please note that it was Barry Goldwater that  put  the  finishing
touch  in  many ways to Nixon.  It was Barry Goldwater, on behalf
of a GOP delegation,  that  went  to  Nixon and says, "*You* must
resign."
 
 
CONSPIRACY NATION:
So both of these elder statesmen carry a lot of weight.
 
 
SHERMAN SKOLNICK:
Especially Strauss.  He's big with the oil industry.  All  you've
got  to  do is look him up in *Who's Who*; I'm sure they've got a
complete run-down of how "plugged-in" he is.
