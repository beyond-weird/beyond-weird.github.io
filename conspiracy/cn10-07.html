LAWRENCE MYERS: JOURNALIST *EXTRAORDINAIRE*
===========================================
 
Lawrence Myers, then a  writer  for Media Bypass Magazine, phones
Charles "Chuck"  Hayes.   Just  a  reporter,  doing  a  telephone
interview.  Hayes supposedly confides to Myers that he is looking
for  a  "wet boy," a.k.a. a hit man, to murder his son.  Sure.  A
reporter calls you and you tell him, "Oh, by the way, I'm looking
for a hit man to murder my son."
 
In  the previous issue of Conspiracy Nation (CN 10.06) I reported
how Myers had played a role  in the dismissal of Hoppy Heidelberg
from a grand jury investigating the April 19, 1995 Oklahoma  City
bombing  or  bombings.  "Mr. Mercedes" (pseudonym) had alerted me
to the connection and I  thought  I  was onto something hot.  But
Sherman Skolnick later  reminded  me  that  the  Myers-Heidelberg
connection  had  already  been  aptly  covered  in the March 1996
*Relevance* newsletter (phone 1-800-626-8944 to subscribe).
 
As a grand juror,  Hoppy  Heidelberg  became aware that important
evidence was being suppressed.  On October  5,  1995,  Heidelberg
wrote  a  letter to the judge overseeing the grand jury, charging
"...an attempt  to  protect  the  identity  of certain suspects."
In their article,  *Relevance*  reports  that the U.S. government
has settled around 4,000 Iraqi prisoners  of  war  in  the  U.S.,
subsequent  to  the Gulf War. The disappearing "John Doe #2" (now
you see him, now you don't) may have once been a member of Saddam
Hussein's elite Republican  Guard.   But  apparently the Oklahoma
grand jury was being manipulated away from certain leads  in  the
case.
 
But  grand  juror  Heidelberg  was  not  your  ordinary,  passive
"sheeple" ("sheep" + "people" = "sheeple").  He struggled against
the manipulation being exerted on the grand jury.  If the Justice
Department was trying to cover up  leads pointing to John Doe #2,
then with  Heidelberg  pushing  in  the  opposite  direction  the
cover-up was threatened.
 
In  September of 1995, Lawrence Myers called Hoppy Heidelberg and
asked for an interview.  Why  would  Myers, a journalist, phone a
sitting member  of  a  grand  jury  and  ask  for  an  interview?
Heidelberg,  quite  rightly,  refused  the  request.   Then Myers
phoned Heidelberg's attorney, John DeCamp, and left the following
message on DeCamp's answering machine:
 
  I do need to hear from  you.   I was going to go down there
  to meet with this Mr. Heidelberg.   I've  already  got  the
  whole  story,  ah everything I need to run with, all I need
  is to get a  picture  of  the  guy...  Now, he's telling me
  that he will not consent to an  interview  with  me.   Sir,
  I've  got  everything.   I've got everything I need to do a
  story on this except a photo of the guy...
 
Myers kept  calling  Heidelberg.   Heidelberg  finally decided to
just listen to whatever Myers had to say.  From what  Myers  told
him,   Heidelberg   at   the  time  suspected  that  his  federal
adversaries must have leaked  information  to the press.  Was the
information leaked so it could be pinned to  Heidelberg  and  get
him  thrown  off the grand jury?  From my subsequent conversation
with Heidelberg (CN 10.06) this seems not to have been the case.
 
In the *Relevance* article, Heidelberg  is quoted as having asked
Myers that "this be an off-the-record conversation.  It  was  not
to  be taped or anything else.  He [Myers] violated his secrecy."
But Heidelberg  was  under  a  false  impression;  he  adds:  "He
[Myers] led me to believe that it was  off  the  record  and  not
being   taped.    However   after  reviewing  the  transcript,  I
discovered that he had very  skillfuly avoided giving me a direct
answer."
 
As in  CN  10.06,  so  too  in  the  *Relevance*  article:   "The
conversation proceeded with Myers doing virtually all the talking
and Heidelberg listening, to make sure that Myers wasn't going to
'harm  anyone  with  incorrect  information.' He stated, 'I never
gave him any  information  he  didn't have already.' [Heidelberg]
also charges that Myers misrepresented him:  'He said the article
was based on an interview with me.'"
 
The article by Myers appeared in the November 1995 issue of Media
Bypass magazine, actually available in mid-October.   On  October
19,  1995,  USA  Today  carried the following:  "A maverick grand
juror in the Oklahoma  City  bombing  case is under investigation
for violating his oath of  secrecy  and  talking  to  a  magazine
popular  among  militia  groups."   On  October  24th, Heidelberg
received a note from the judge  to whom he had written on October
5th, in which Heidelberg had complained of "an attempt to protect
the identity of certain suspects."  Wrote the judge:   "Effective
immediately you are dismissed from the grand jury."
