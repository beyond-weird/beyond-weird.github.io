The key factor in this, one which I have re-iterated to one
other questioner, is that this list's being public for 30
days WAS A FLUKE
     ^^^^^^^^^^^

That is the KEY factor here. The list was NOT meant to be
made public, but somebody goofed and it was publicly available
for 30 days.

Besides Skolnick, Orlin Grabbe has said he's seen the list.

Anyway, it's no wonder that you cannot find the list now in
your searches, since when the error was discovered (as to
the list being accidentally made public) it was immediately
buried. That list is so buried now that you'd need dynamite
and backhoes to get at it. 

Note: "dynamite" above is meant figuratively and not 
literally. I am not advocating the use of dynamite.
