"HARVARD TRAINED" & "YALE TRAINED"
==================================
 
In the recently released book, *Bordering on Chaos:   Guerrillas,
Stockbrokers,  Politicians,  and  Mexico's Road to Prosperity* by
Andres Oppenheimer, we learn that former Mexican President Carlos
Salinas was so often referred to as "the Harvard trained Salinas"
that he eventually became nicknamed "Harvard Trained Salinas".
 
U.S. President Bill Clinton  is  a  Yale  alumnus, so he could be
called "Yale Trained Clinton".
 
"Harvard Trained Salinas" was  doing  some  (I  guess)  brilliant
things  when  he  was  president  of Mexico.  They must have been
brilliant,  because  I,  "Northern  Illinois  University  Trained
Redman", fail to understand them.
 
For example, the Mexican state  of Chiapas is so impoverished, it
is known as "Mexico's basement" -- in  other  words  it  is  kept
hidden  how backward it is.  The majority of its people are poor,
Indian peasants.  The women must  walk  for hours every day, just
so their families can have water and firewood.  Their shacks  are
lucky to have a tin roof.
 
So what does Harvard  Trained  and  his government do?  Help them
get electricity and  running  water?   No,  Harvard  Trained  and
upper-crust chums decide to get them 3700 basketball courts!  The
Chiapas  Indians,  thanks  to  Harvard Trained, then put together
12,000 basketball teams.  They  still  don't have shoes and their
average height is about 5 feet 3 inches  tall  --  but  hey:   at
least  after  a  hard  day  of toting firewood they can relax and
shoot some hoops!
 
Harvard Trained also caused an $11  million,  world  class  opera
house  to  be  built in Chiapas.  While it was being built, right
next door, two  homeless  Indian  children  died of exposure.  It
seems the nights grow cold in Chiapas.
 
"Yale Trained Clinton" is somebody we Americans know plenty about
already, so I won't go into that here.  One thing  though:   Yale
Trained  apparently  has  never,  ever, worked at a real job.  It
seems Yale Trained just went right from Yale to politics, without
ever getting his hands dirty.
 
Craig Livingstone, designated fall  guy  for Yale Trained and the
gang, *has* actually worked at a real job.  We hear that he  has,
in the past, worked as a (how gross and common) "bouncer".  (Uff!
Whatever that is.  I hope he's washed his hands.)  Representative
Tom  Lantos  of  California,  obviously  a "team player" for whom
there is no such thing as  "stooping  too low", went so far as to
hint that the honorable thing would be for Livingstone to go blow
his brains out.  According to Congressman Lantos, Admiral Boorda,
after relatively minor infractions, nonetheless saw fit to  "fall
on his sword" and, by implication because Livingstone's acts were
apparently  so much worse, the least that Livingstone ought to do
would be likewise.
 
Sickening  also  to  see is the "watchdog press" now going into a
"feeding frenzy"  around  Livingstone.   Obviously  this bunch of
sharks have been sent by their Lords and Masters to "rip  him  to
shreds."   Too  bad  the "watchdog press" in America still hasn't
sniffed out the  *real*  stories  such  as  (a)  strange death of
Vincent Foster, (b) U.S. government butchers children near  Waco,
Texas,  and (c) Gun- and drug-running by CIA, especially at Mena,
Arkansas during the 1980s.
 
Most sickening of all is my fellow countrymen, who, by and large,
choose not to see.
