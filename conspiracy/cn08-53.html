RUMOR MILL NEWS SERVICE #3
==========================
 
The Rumor Mill News  Service  is  edited by "RU".  The following,
from what I can tell, appears to be RUMOR ONLY.  What is more,  I
have  NO  IDEA  who  the  author  is;  I  received  the following
anonymously, with the promise of "more to come".

                         Missile Update
                 4 More Stingers Targeting U.S.
 
RMNews sources have  discovered  that  there  are  4 more Stinger
missiles in the possession of the Islamic terrorists that  downed
TWA 800.  The terrorists have threatened to use them on more U.S.
targets.
 
The  secret briefing on Capitol Hill yesterday (7/19/96) informed
the leaders of the  United  States  of  the bloody threat.  These
leaders have chosen to remain silent.   Inner  circle  informants
have  stated  that  their  silence is to keep the American people
from panicking.
 
If this is true, our  leaders  are willing to sacrifice hundreds,
if not thousands of innocent people to avert a panic.   But  what
is the rest of the story?
 
1.   A  panic  would  cause  an  already unstable stock market to
collapse.
 
2.   International  bankers  and   corporate  giants  would  lose
billions of dollars.
 
3.  No one would watch the Olympics because  they  would  be  too
busy trying to brace against a terrorist invasion.
 
4.   Corporate  giants who have bought up all the advertising for
the Olympic games would see their money wasted.
 
5.  NBC, the network giant who snagged the  Olympic  broadcasting
contract  this  year  is  owned  by  General  Electric  (GE).  If
Americans  were   scrambling   to   protect   themselves  against
terrorists, NBC's coverage  of  the  games  would  be  the  least
watched programs on television.
    Don't forget that GE also brought us the Patriot missiles and
trotted out Tom Brokaw  singing  their  praises.  During the Gulf
War, Americans cheered every time a Patriot missile shot down  an
Iraqi  Scud  missile.  It was only after the war was over and the
devastating effects  of  Gulf  War  Syndrome  were  seen that the
Patriot missiles were unmasked for the dismal failures they were.
Not only did they cost over 1 million dollars apiece, they failed
to destroy the warheads of the Scuds.  The only thing the Patriot
was capable of doing was prematurely ending  the  flight  of  the
Scud.   But  since  the  Scuds  had  no targets anyway, it didn't
matter where their  warheads  fell,  because  anywhere would have
been acceptable to the Iraqis.
    The  Patriot  missiles  did   not   prevent  the  Scuds  from
scattering their payload of biological and chemical warfare.   In
fact,  the  missiles  more  than likely caused the biological and
chemical agents to be scattered over a much wider area.  How many
Gulf War veterans  brought  home  an  illness  that was caused by
Scuds which were intercepted by Patriots?
    NBC and its parent company, General Electric, has never  told
the  American people the truth of the Iraqi war and their part in
it.  It  is  highly  unlikely  that  they  will  risk hundreds of
millions, if not billions of dollars in advertising  money,  just
because  a  few  thousand  Americans  might  die  from  terrorist
attacks.
 
6.    President  Clinton  is  using  the  Atlanta  Olympics  like
President Reagan used the  Los  Angeles  Olympics to make himself
look presidential in this election year.  If they are  cancelled,
his  photo  ops  with  world  leaders  and  star  athletes  would
vaporize...   just  like  the  bodies  of  the  Americans  he  is
sacrificing to terrorist missiles.
 
                Don't Fly For at Least 30 Days
 
Cancel all  vacations  that  require  air  travel.   Postpone all
business trips.  Tell your clients that you are  going  into  the
hospital,  getting  married, checking into a rehab... anything is
better than boarding a plane right now.
 
Explore the new teleconferencing gadgets  that can be hooked into
your computer or telephone.  Enlist  your  business  contacts  in
your experiment... help keep them alive also.
 
If  worse comes to worse and you find you have to fly outside the
country, take British  Airways,  Lufthansa  or  one  of the Asian
airlines... or fly out of Canada or Mexico.
 
Within the continental  United  States,  fly  Southwest  Airlines
(SW),   the   "Company   Airline."   It  was  started  as  a  CIA
proprietary.  (For those in the know at the top of SW, it was Bob
Walker and his other more infamous alias who arranged the funding
for you.)  SW Airlines has  up to the minute intelligence reports
that are unavailable to the other airlines.  Since  this  is  the
airline used by many high ranking government spooks, they have to
ensure  their  own  safety.   I  would  imagine  that SW Airlines
aircraft are being  refitted  right  now  to carry "Willie Peter"
flares which can be shot out in a scatter pattern to attract heat
seeking missiles and protect the airplanes.  But  since  the  CIA
and  its  [garbled]  have  known  about the Stinger missiles ever
since they sold them to the  Afghanis who [garbled], it is likely
that  SW  Airlines  was  equipped  with  "Willie  Peter"   (white
phospherous) quite some time ago.
 
Americans  must  remember  that  the  Mujahedeen  of  Afghanistan
offered to sell over 100 Stinger  missiles  back  to  the  United
States  and  the  U.S.  declined  their  offer.   RMNews  sources
predicted tragedy at that time.
