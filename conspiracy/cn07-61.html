RON BROWN: ENTREPRENEUR
=======================
 
I say "entrepreneur"  above,  harking  back  to Debra von Trapp's
statement in her letter to Kenneth Starr (See CN 7.10):
 
  Robert Goetzman called me  on  the  night  Vince  Foster  was
  killed.   He said:  "We did him."  "We did him somewhere else
  but we dumped  him  in  a  queer  park  to  send a message to
  Clinton   and   his   queer   wife."    "He   (Foster)   went
  entreprenurial on us."  "He was  selling  NSA  codes  to  the
  Israelis."
 
Why would Foster have been killed?   Apparently  because  he  had
become "overly entrepreneurial".  In other words, Foster seems to
have  gotten  too  greedy  and that's why he may have been bumped
off.
 
The possibility of Foster having  become greedy and branching out
on his own is also suggested by  Orlin  Grabbe  in  a  series  of
articles   written   by   him   and   archived  at  ftp.shout.net
pub/users/bigred/og.  In  part  33  "Allegations  Regarding Vince
Foster, the NSA, and Banking Transactions Spying,"  for  example,
Grabbe asks
 
  Why  is  the Mossad, like the White House, in panic mode over
  the reopening of the investigation into Foster's death?  What
  is it they don't want the  U.S.  public to find out?  Why did
  the  operating  code  for  a  new   computer   developed   by
  NSA-subcontractor  E-Systems  of Dallas, Texas, end up in the
  hands of the  Israelis  within  one  month?  Did Vince Foster
  sell it to them?
 
Another infamous fellow who appears to have gotten too greedy and
been snuffed out would be Barry Seal.  In the  bestselling  book,
*Compromised:    Clinton,   Bush   and   the   CIA*  (Clandestine
Publishing.   ISBN:   1-883955-02-5),  it  is  alleged  that drug
smuggler, DEA informant  and  CIA  "operative"  Barry  Seal  "had
become a liability by violating the basic rule of trust, one that
controls  assets.   By  doing  so...   Seal had grown outside the
Agency's [CIA's]  control  by  trying  to  go  into  business for
himself..."
 
And, add authors Terry Reed and John Cummings, it was  "like  the
Mafia  whose  rules  were  simple:   you  don't  go  outside  the
organization and freelance without prior approval of the bosses."
 
The  Mafia  reference  is  apt, considering that murdered Chicago
mobster Salvatore "Momo" Giancana is reported to have also viewed
the CIA and the Mafia  as  basically  the same.  According to his
younger brother, Chuck Giancana (*Double Cross*.   Warner  Books,
1992),  big  brother Salvatore once stated that the gangsters and
the CIA were "two sides  of  the  same coin."  Regular readers of
Conspiracy Nation will not find  this  concept  too  far  outside
their  paradigm, although those tuning in late may be startled by
the assertion.  (See, for  further  background, the February 1996
Conspiracy Nation Newsletter, "Clash of the Titans", in which the
criminal origins of the British  aristocracy  are  touched  upon.
See also Gustavus Myers' hard-to-find book, *History of the Great
American Fortunes*.)
 
Which brings us to the late Commerce Secretary Ron  Brown.   What
do  Barry  Seal,  Vince Foster, and Ron Brown all have in common?
Answer:  each of them had  become "overly entrepreneurial" or, in
plainer language, had become so greedy as to threaten the  smooth
operation  of  the organization they worked for.  You've seen the
old gangster movies: 
 
  "Why was Vinnie killed?"
  "He got too big for his britches.  He was startin' to mess up
  the entire operation."
 
Then, after  the  assassination,  all  the  crime  families  come
together  at the funeral -- just like the government factions are
now coming together for Ron  Brown's funeral.  But what plots are
they hatching, even as "Capo" Brown is laid to rest?
