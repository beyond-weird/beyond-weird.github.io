THE FIRST OPIUM WAR
===================
 
(Source for the  following  is  *Dope,  Inc.*  by  the Editors of
Executive Intelligence Review.  I neither necessarily  agree  nor
disagree with all or portions of the following.)
 
 +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +  +
 
1601 -- Original Jesuit mission is established at Beijing, China.
The  Jesuits,   having   achieved   positions   of  "unquestioned
authority" at the Chinese royal court, hold the key to the  opium
trade.   They  are  later followed by the Portuguese and then the
Dutch.
 
1659  -- The Dutch now control the ancient dope trade routes.  In
exchange for taxes paid  to  the  Mogul  court, Dutch traders are
allowed to force Indian peasants to produce dope for them.
 
1715 -- The British East India Company opens an office in Canton,
China.
 
1750 -- By now the Dutch are shipping more than 100 tons of opium
per year to Indonesia.  Besides business  advantages,  the  Dutch
have  discovered  that  opium is "a useful means for breaking the
moral resistance of Indonesians  who  opposed the introduction of
their semi-servile but increasingly profitable plantation system.
They deliberately spread the drug habits from the ports... to the
countryside."
    (How were the drug habits "deliberately  spread"?   The  book,
*Dope,   Inc.*,   does   not   exactly  say.   Nowadays,  certain
"rebellious" rock and  roll  songs  serve  as advertising jingles
which help lure in potential consumers.  Censorship, however,  is
not  the  answer.   But  be  aware  when  you hear lyrics such as
"Ritalin is in.  Ritalin is  in," that "somebody" might be trying
to sell you something.)
 
1757 -- Military victories make Bengal a British colony.
 
1783 -- Lord  Shelburne,  who  concluded  peace negotiations with
America after our Revolutionary War, is the power behind  William
Pitt  the  Younger,  British Prime Minister.  Shelburne is allied
with the Jesuits, the Knights  of  St. John of Jerusalem, and the
East India Company. 
    Both the British  Empire  and  the  East  India  Company  are
bankrupt.  Lord Shelburne and associates take over the East India
Company,  and  makes  it  "the central instrument of loot for the
maintenance of the  British  Empire."   Shelburne proposes to use
"free trade" as a cover for both subverting the United States and
expanding the opium trade into the Far East.
    Lord  Shelburne  is  allied  also  with  Francis  Baring,  an
Anglo-Dutch banker.
 
1787 -- British Secretary  of  State  Dundas  has  proposed  that
Britain  force  itself  more into China so as to help augment the
opium market there.  The East  India  Company, acting in a manner
reminiscent of  our  own  American  Central  Intelligence  Agency
(CIA),  establishes "cut outs" -- intermediaries -- to handle the
export of opium from India to China.
 
1830 -- Number of  chests  filled  with  opium being brought into
China has increased fourfold since late 1700s: 18,956 chests.
 
1836 -- Number of chests filled with  opium  being  brought  into
China: greater than 30,000 chests.
 
1839 -- China launches its own  version of a "War on Drugs".  Lin
Tse-hsu is appointed drug czar.  He cracks down on  the  "Society
of  Heaven and Earth," also known as The Triad Society, which had
been recruited by the East  India Company into the opium business
in the early 1800s.
    But Lin goes too far.  He  tries to arrest a British national
connected to the dope trade.  British  warships  intervene.   Lin
responds  by  holding  British  tea  for ransom, until and unless
merchants  turn  over  their  opium  stockpiles.   Britain's Lord
Palmerston, backed by the powerful British Navy, demands (1) full
legalization of opium trade  into  China;  (2)  compensation  for
opium  stockpiles confiscated by Lin; and (3) British sovereignty
over several offshore islands.
 
June 1840 -- The British fleet arrives in force and  lays  siege.
Chinese  forces are relatively weak, due partly to drug addiction
within their Imperial Army.  The Chinese Emperor asks for a peace
treaty.
 
1842 -- The Treaty of Nanking, among  other  things,  gives  Hong
Kong  to  the  British.   To this day Hong Kong is said to be the
capital of British drug-running.
