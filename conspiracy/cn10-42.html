TED TURNER: MEDIA MOGUL *EXTRAORDINAIRE*
========================================
A Rat Amongst Rats OR What Will Ted Reincarnate As?
---------------------------------------------------
 
      But  it  seems that something has happened that has
    never happened before:  though we know not just when,
    or why, or how, or where.
      Men have left God not for other gods, they say, but
    for no god; and this has never happened before.
                -- T.S. Eliot, "Choruses from 'The Rock'"
 
Confirmed  in  the  Washington   Times  National  Weekly  Edition
(4/13/97) are remarks  made  by  Ted  Turner  subsequent  to  the
Heavens  Gate  tragedy.   As earlier widely reported on Internet,
Turner, founder of Turner  Broadcasting  and driving force behind
the Cable  News  Network  (CNN),  described  the  supposed  "mass
suicide" as "a good way to get rid of a few nuts."  Regarding the
belief  that  some sort of UFO was following the Hale-Bopp Comet,
Turner reportedly stated that  he  would  "kind  of like to go up
there myself.  Is there that much difference in  other  religions
saying you're going to heaven?"
 
Turner,  himself  treated as a minor deity by wage slaves at CNN,
made his remarks on  March  29th,  the  day before Easter Sunday.
What is CNN's response? "Hail Turner!" most likely.
 
And let's not forget this  other  Teddy Turner remark:  "The U.S.
has got some of the dumbest people in the world.  I want  you  to
know  that.   We  know  that."   ("Viewpoint,"  U.S. News & World
Report, 5/20/96, p.   22.   Quoted  in  *Treason:   The New World
Order* by Gurudas.  ISBN:  0-945946-14-7)
 
Who  is  Turner  married  to?   "Hanoi  Jane"  Fonda,  herself  a
questionable quantity.
 
Who are some of  those  connected  to  Turner's  offspring,  CNN?
There's  Wyatt  Thomas  Johnson,  Jr.,  of the Council on Foreign
Relations (CFR) and  the  Trilateral  Commission (TC), President;
Rowland Evans, Jr. (CFR), "Evans and Novak"; Bernard Kalb  (CFR),
"Reliable  Sources";  Rev. Jesse Jackson (CFR), "Both Sides"; and
Frank Sesno (CFR), anchor.  (Source:  *Who's Who of the Elite* by
Robert Gaylon Ross, Sr. ISBN: 0-9649888-0-1)
 
So what's the big  deal  about  the  Council on Foreign Relations
(CFR)?  Consider this:  80 percent of our leaders come  from  the
Council  on  Foreign  Relations  and  the  Trilateral Commission;
astoundingly, CFR and  TC  have  less  than  3,000 total members.
Hmm...  Is that statistically significant?  (Source:  *Enroute To
Global Occupation* by Gary H. Kah. ISBN: 0-910311-97-8)
 
In fact, it's not just CNN that's infested with  members  of  CFR
and  TC.   Here  is a partial list of past and present CFR and TC
members:
** CBS:  William Paley  (CFR);  Dan  Rather (CFR); Harry Reasoner
(CFR); Bill Moyers (CFR).
** NBC:  Tom Brokaw (CFR); John  Chancellor  (CFR);  Marvin  Kalb
(CFR); Irvine R. Levine (CFR).
** ABC:  Peter Jennings (Bilderbergs); David Brinkley (CFR); John
Scali (CFR); Barbara Walters (CFR).
** PBS: Robert McNeil (CFR); Jim Lehrer (CFR).
(Source: Books by Ross and by Kah; see above.)
 
Also on the  Ted  Turner  CNN  team  is  Daniel Schorr (CFR), who
recently (see CN 10.40) opined that  support  by  the  family  of
assassinated civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King for a new
trial for James Earl Ray was misguided, that "the Kings were just
feeding into a new movie by Oliver Stone."
 
CFR's Rev. Jesse Jackson also, reportedly, is against a new trial
for  James  Earl  Ray.  And "CFR Jesse's" son, now a congressman,
does he follow the lead of "dear old dad?"
 
Anyway,  it's  all  a  rat's  nest of well-groomed, well-dressed,
"team players," freeloading  on  the  public's  airwaves and then
sticking it to us in thanks for our largesse.  And what  can  you
do?   Don't watch the commercials, for one:  everytime they go to
a commercial, change channels.
