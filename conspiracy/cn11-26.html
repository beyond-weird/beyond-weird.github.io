THE LAMP OF LEARNING
====================

During the "Dark Ages"  in  Europe  (from  about  the fall of the
Roman Empire until the Renaissance), the very few -- in this case
certain groups of monks -- carried the lamp  of  learning  across
the ages. 

                        -+- Illusion -+-

The twentieth century is the current "dark age," pretending to be
sophisticated  and  enlightened,  yet actually willfully blind to
many things.  True learning, say  some,  has never been meant for
the  many,  yet  an  army   of   state-stamped   and   -certified
"intellectuals"  gives  the opposite *illusion*.  The illusion we
live in is that there are  quite a lot of "educated" people these
days. The *fact* is that ignorance has rarely been greater.

                       -+- Ignorance -+-

The choice of word --  "ignorance"  --  is  used  advisedly.   By
ignorance  is  meant,  *to willfully ignore*.  Ignore-ance, among
the mass of "educated"  (who  would  be  stunned to know they are
ignore-ant),  is  so  omnipresent  it   is   both   obvious   and
hard-to-see.   Examples of common ignore-ance prevalent among the
"educated" are

                   -+- The Truth: IGNORED -+-

  (1)  Lincoln  Assassination:   An  obvious  "plot  within a
  plot," yet this  has  been  steadfastly  *ignored*  by  the
  "educated."

  (2) JFK Assassination:  No doubt that the death of JFK goes
  far  beyond  Lee  Harvey Oswald, yet a phalanx of "experts"
  continues to run interference.

  (3) RFK Assassination:   Much  more  than "lone nut" Sirhan
  Sirhan   is    involved,    nonetheless    the    perceived
  "intellectuals" choose not to see.

  (4)  MLK  Assassination:   *Proven*  (*Orders  To  Kill* by
  William F.  Pepper)  that  James  Earl  Ray  was  *not* the
  shooter; "well-educated" "historians" declare otherwise.

  (5) October Surprise:  Demonstrated over and over that  the
  plot occurred, yet the "educated" see it not.

  (6)  HIV-AIDS **HYPOTHESIS**:  At this late date, according
  to normal scientific  standards,  it  has *not* been proven
  that HIV causes AIDS.  (See *Inventing the AIDS  Virus*  by
  Peter   Duesberg.)   But  after  constant  droning  to  the
  contrary by  "experts,"  even  savvy  readers of Conspiracy
  Nation might have been fooled.

  (7) TWA 800:  Ill-fated TWA Flight 800 was brought down  by
  a  missile.   (See *The Downing of TWA Flight 800* by James
  Sanders -- Get this book before it disappears!)  "Educated"
  stuffed-suits    in    Television-Land    continue    their
  white-knuckled ignore-ance.

  (8) OKC "Bombing":   Really  *more*  than  *one*  bomb,  it
  should  be  referred to in the plural -- OKC *bombings*.  A
  single "fertilizer  bomb"  could  *not*  have  done all the
  damage on April 19, 1995 at the Murrah Building.  With  all
  the  supposedly  educated  people extant, how is it that so
  few can see and speak the truth?

  (9) Death of Vincent Foster:  *Maybe* it was a suicide, but
  it did not happen *there*, on the berm, at Fort Marcy Park.
  "Educated" citizens abound, yet  what  good is the supposed
  education when the nerve to see is lacking?

  (10) Waco Massacre:   Women  and  children,  many  of  them
  African-American,   were   *murdered*   by   federal   "law
  enforcement"  agents.   Tens of thousands of Americans hang
  impressive "education" credentials  on their walls; they've
  attended the "very best" universities -- and their eyes are
  sewn shut.

Many more items could be added to the above list.

                      -+- True Learning -+-

True learning may never have been meant for any but  the  few  --
the  few  with  NERVE  enough  to  SEE.   True learning does take
self-discipline, study, and at  least average intelligence.  *But
it takes more.* It takes NERVE to

  Seek the truth
  Come whence it may
  Cost what it will 
              -- [1]

No state-aligned "education" factory can mass-produce *guts*.

                  -+- The Enemy of Learning -+-

We "quaint" "conspiracy theorists" not only need *nerve*, we need
a thick skin.  "Educated"  persons  who  either  don't  know  any
better  or knowingly serve as murderers of learning at the behest
of their masters -- persons like Gerald Posner and Chip Berlet --
are on the prowl.  They control the loudspeakers, and use them to
blare  us  out  with  their  mis-representations,  ridicule,  and
defamations.  The enemy of learning  in  our time is not the iron
maiden and the rack  of  the  torture  chamber,  it  is  massive,
choking, credentialed IGNORE-ANCE.
