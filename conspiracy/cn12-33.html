SWISSAIR FLIGHT 111: THE AIDS CONNECTION
========================================
Steamshovel Press Editor Kenn Thomas Widens The Picture
-------------------------------------------------------
Letter from Steamshovel Press editor, Kenn Thomas

Brian:

I don't  know  if  Sherman  [Skolnick]  has  seen  the  below, or
continues despite it to believe that Bandar bin saud was actually
Bandar bin sultan.  Das GOAT has since apologized for making  the
error in an earlier report..

--------------------------<< Insert >>---------------------------
Wrong guy!

Bandar bin sultan is the Ambassador to the US.
Bandar bin saud is one of the many grandsons of Fahd.

Two  different  guys  with names that are similar to us, but very
different to an Arab.

-------------------------<< End Insert >>------------------------

Still,  Bandar  bin  Saud  is  a Saudi royal, making him a likely
Osama bin Laden target  and  only  one  in a line of coincidental
deaths on Flight 111.   These  include  officials  of  the  World
Intellectual   Property   Organization  (WIPO),  AIDS  researcher
Jonathan  Mann  and  his  wife,  a  virus  specialist.   A  virus
specialist from the Centers of Disease Control in Atlanta died in
the Kenya embassy bombing.

Another person  who  died  in  Kenya--an administrative assistant
whose duties remain obscure--barely missed an earlier brush  with
death  by  not  taking  a  scheduled flight that ended in a fatal
crash.  That  same  pattern  saved  Mohammed  Ferrat, an Algerian
business associate of Ron Brown who later  died  on  Flight  800.
The FBI took a special interest in Ferrat when investigating 800,
ostensibly  because  only  his  first  name  was  listed  on  the
passenger  manifest.   Osama bin Laden has many Algerian business
contacts.  Again, Ferrat was  supposed  to  be  on the plane that
killed Brown but rescheduled at the last minute.

As the  Steamshovel  web  site (https://https://.umsl.edu/~skthoma) has
pointed out for a while now, initial reports about the Flight 800
crash warned people away from the  rescue  area  because  of  the
possible  existence of AIDS-tainted blood packets.  The author of
Underground Tunnels and  Bases,  Richard  Sauder, discovered that
Brown owned a patent for an AIDS-like  retro-virus.   The  office
that failed to ask appropriate questions--through incompetence or
intent--  about  the  bullet-like  wound  in the x-ray of Brown's
skull, the Army Institute  of  Pathology, recently has been doing
odd studies of viruses.  (See the Steamshovel site for details.)

What makes all that  doubly  coincidental  is  Brown's role as an
intellectual property negotiator for the GATT treaty.   Like  the
WIPO  people wiped out on Flight 111, Brown worked to consolidate
patents for these viral  organisms  under one global system.  The
attempt there is to change intellectual property laws in  various
countries,  particularly in the third world, to conform with, and
allow easier commercial exploitation by, the US and its allies.

So these bombings may have to do with a global struggle to create
disease and profit from its  cure.  Considering how AIDS alone is
expected in the coming years to make an even more dramatic impact
on Africa than here, these  stakes  are certainly high enough for
this kind of covert war.  [1]

Also, Adnan Khashoggi's name  has been associated with scientific
endeavors identical to those of the Army Institute of  Pathology.
This  involves  the recovery of RNA residue from survivors of the
1918 Spanish flu epidemic and,  again,  more details can be found
at the Steamshovel  site  (https://https://.umsl.edu/~skthoma).   Danny
Casolaro  was  investigating Khashoggi on the day he died, and so
he figured prominently in  the transnational power cabal Casolaro
called the Octopus.  Khashoggi is an arms merchant who goes  back
to  the  Lockheed  scandals,  was an Iran-Contra player, and some
have suspected him of being involved in the deaths of Dodi  Fayed
and Diana.

Brown's patent, for those who wish to check the veracity  of  all
this,  is  no.   WO  9208784, "human t-lymphotropic virus type 2"
scraped from the cells of Panamanian Indians.

I hope you can pass  this  information on to your readers.  Also,
let them know that the new issue  of  Steamshovel  Press  is  now
finally  out  and  available for $6 from POB 23715, St. Louis, MO
63121. [2]

--------------------------<< Notes >>----------------------------
[1]  Worth  mentioning  as  a  factor in the AIDS question is the
fact, as documented by Professor Peter Duesberg (U of C/Berkeley)
in his book, "Inventing the  AIDS  Virus," that at this late date
we =do not know= what causes AIDS.  Specifically, the truism that
HIV causes AIDS is still an unproven hypothesis.  Caution:   Even
though HIV is not proven to cause AIDS, it's still a good idea to
practice "safe sex."

magazine, "Steamshovel Press."
