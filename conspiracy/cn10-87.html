HILLARY "MADAME DEFARGE" CLINTON KNITS ITEMS FOR SADDAM HUSSEIN
===============================================================
 "Madame Defarge" Works for "Lafarge" And BNL Pays the Charge
 ------------------------------------------------------------

Oh  that Hillary!  You've got to wonder if she was always getting
in trouble back  in  Junior  High.   Our  latest  installment  in
Hillary's continuing adventures involves the Lafarge Corporation,
U.S.  subsidiary  of a French multinational chemical firm.  They,
says Marianne Gasior,  source  for  an  article  in the Nov. 1996
American Spectator magazine ("What Ever Happened To  Iraqgate?"),
helped secretly supply Saddam Hussein and Iraq with weapons.

Ms. Gasior, an attorney, worked for Kennametal, Inc. According to
the article, by Kenneth R. Timmerman (author also of a book, *The
Death  Lobby:   How  the  West  Armed  Iraq*),  it  appears  that
Kennametal was involved in a covert  weapons  pipeline  to  Iraq.
(Kennametal   denies  the  allegations.)   Reportedly,  equipment
originated at  Kennametal  in  Latrobe,  Pennsylvania,  went to a
warehouse  in  Ohio,  was  carried  by  truck  to   a   munitions
manufacturer  connected  to  Lafarge, got put on cargo ships, and
wound up  in  Great  Britain.   There,  says Gasior, Kennametal's
British subsidiary changed the labels and sent the material on to
Iraq.

Timmerman's sources say that Hillary  Rodham  Clinton  did  legal
work, via the Rose Law Firm, for Lafarge, in the late 1980s.  And
from  1990  through  1992,  Hillary  served on Lafarge's Board of
Directors.  Says Gasior:   "Hillary  Rodham  Clinton was directly
linked to the network that was involved in a clandestine CIA arms
export ring."

Why would CIA have helped Saddam Hussein?  During the 1980s, Iraq
and its neighbor, Iran, were involved  in  a  bloody  war.   This
Iran-Iraq  war suited U.S. geopolitical purposes:  as long as the
two nations were  busy  fighting  each  other,  they weren't much
threat to other nations, and to U.S. interests,  in  the  region.
But  the  prolonged  war could not go on if Iran were to gain the
upper hand.  To keep things even, the U.S. secretly supplied Iraq
with  sophisticated  weapons.    According   to  former  National
Security  Council  official  Howard  Teicher,  then-CIA  Director
William Casey "personally spearheaded the effort to  ensure  that
Iraq  had sufficient military weapons, ammunition and vehicles to
avoid losing the Iran-Iraq war."

For  her  whistleblowing efforts, Marianne Gasior was "rewarded,"
she says, by being warned to  shut  up or else risk being "hurt."
She claims her car was broken into and documents stolen, and  she
apparently  narrowly  avoided  an arson attempt on her home.  The
whole  case,  naturally,  was  referred  to  Kenneth  Starr,  who
swallows all damaging information  under the rubric of conducting
an investigation.   Gasior  says  she  was  told  that  "anything
involving  the First Lady or Vincent Foster has to be referred to
the Office of the Independent Counsel."

In previous issues of Conspiracy  Nation (CN 10.77 and CN 10.82),
Sherman H. Skolnick has widened the  allegations.   In  "Foster's
Documents,"  he  claims that George Bush was a principal owner of
the weapons  firm  on  which  Hillary  sat  as  a director.  Both
Skolnick and Timmerman single out the Banca Nazionale del  Lavoro
(BNL)  as  connected  to  the  illicit arms for Saddam operation.
Taking the rap  for  a  $5.5  billion  bank fraud was Christopher
Drogoul, a low-level branch manager for BNL.  The Atlanta  branch
of  BNL  had  "lent"  money  to several companies which, in turn,
supplied weapons to Iraq.  Well,  too bad for Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro, because they never got paid back  for  the  "loans"  (you
might say.)  Not to worry:  all-around  nice  guy  Bill  Clinton,
through  Attorney General Janet Reno, made sure that BNL received
more than $400 million  to  help  them assuage their loss.  Where
did that $400+ million  come  from?   It  came  from  *you*,  the
American taxpayer.
