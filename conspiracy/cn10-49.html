BILL CLINTON'S "BRIDGE" TO CHINA
================================
(Source: "Relevance" newsletter, Feb./March 1997)
-------------------------------------------------
 
                    -+- Cast Of Characters -+-
 
WANG JUN -- He runs  Poly  Technologies, a subsidiary of the Poly
Group.   Also,  Chairman  of  the  Chinese government-owned China
International Trade and Investment Company (CITIC).  According to
both Sherman  Skolnick  and  Tom  in  Venice,  KEN  STARR is also
connected with CITIC, either as legal representative or  even  as
an unregistered lobbyist.
 
CHARLIE TRIE -- Arranged interface between Bill Clinton and  WANG
JUN. Trie has recently fled the U.S.
 
BAOPING  "ROBERT" MA -- Chinese head of PTK, a subsidiary of Poly
Technologies.  PTK is connected  with  the attempted smuggling of
2,000 AK-47s into the U.S. Were these guns  destined  for  street
gangs, as a planned act of subversion?  And, how many *more* guns
and  even  missiles  were  *successfully* smuggled into the U.S.?
Are street gangs now armed with massive firepower?
 
MAJOR GENERAL HE PING -- A  subordinate  of WANG JUN.  He Ping is
married to Deng Rong, daughter of the late  Chinese  leader  Deng
Xiaoping.
 
MOCHTAR  RIADY  -- Owns Lippo Group.  Is Lippo Group the "bridge"
between Bill Clinton and Red  China?  The Riady's own the largest
bank in Southeast Asia; out of  50  U.S.  states,  why  did  they
choose Arkansas for their American subsidiary? 
   MOCHTAR RIADY is part owner of Worthen Bank.  In 1992, Worthen
Bank gave the Clinton campaign a $3.5 million loan. 
   RIADY  is  a  top  financial  advisor  to  Indonesian dictator
Suharto. Suharto's army massacred over 200,000 in East Timor.
   Hillary Clinton's former law  firm  boss is Joseph Giroir, Jr.
Giroir is now the top lawyer for the Riadys.
 
JOHN HUANG -- Born in China, he is  President  of  Lippo  Group's
American  division.   Huang  got  a  "top secret" clearance and a
high-level position in  the  Clinton  Commerce Department.  Above
Huang was the late Ron Brown, who  died  in  a  mysterious  plane
crash.   Also  dead  under  mysterious  circumstances was Barbara
Wise.  Her body was found in a Commerce Department office the day
after Thanksgiving, 1996. 
   While  at  the  Commerce  Department,  Huang  received  37 CIA
briefings and over a dozen secret intelligence reports,  many  of
which  dealt  with  China.   Huang  managed  somehow  to keep his
security clearance even after he left the Commerce Department.
 
MR.  SHEN JUEREN -- Head  of  alleged spy front, China Resources.
China Resources has a partner: the Lippo Group.
 
AND:  As Sherman Skolnick asks, "What is  the  reason  that  none
dare  call  it treason?"  Could it be that many elected officials
have their own  dirty  laundry,  are  blackmailable, and so don't
dare squawk too loudly?
