FEMINISM: ON THE MARCH
======================
 
In Conspiracy Nation Volume  8  Number  35  was mentioned how the
Women's Christian Temperance Movement (WCTU)  and  its  offshoots
were  not  so  much  a populist women's movement as they were the
hired army of families such  as  the Astors, the Vanderbilts, the
Warburgs, and the Rockefellers.  Purpose:  to agitate and vote in
the 18th Amendment and consequent Prohibition during the "roaring
twenties".   Prohibition,  in  turn,  had  as  its  purpose   the
strengthening  of  gang  structures  and  passive  acceptance  of
gangsters into the society.
 
Of course, the women's movement  did  not  arise out of a vacuum,
as, for example, Andrea  Pearson  has  argued.   There  has  been
injustice  against women -- though not to the hyperbolized extent
it is portrayed night after night in television docudramas.  (See
CN 3.66, 3.69, 3.70, and 3.72 for Pearson's argument:  "Feminism:
Mask for Marxism".)
 
An aftermath of the so-called  "60s  Rebellion"  was  the  modern
womyn's  movement,  so overly familiar to attendees of university
literature classes.  Yet we  are  beginning  to see more and more
how much of what was perceived as "rebellion"  during  the  1960s
was  not  quite  what it seemed.  For example the introduction of
LSD into the popular culture of  the  time may well have been CIA
inspired.  So too, Sherman  Skolnick  has  pointed  to  so-called
"radicals"  of  the 1960s, such as Rennie Davis, as not being the
free agents  they  were  supposed  to  be.   Even  "radical" Bill
Clinton, "anti-war protester", turns out to have been an agent of
the CIA.
 
Dave Emory, the west coast researcher into "deep  politics",  has
definitely  linked  portions  of  the modern (post 1960s) womyn's
movement to the CIA.  For example, in his lecture series, "Gloria
in Excelsis", he explores just  who *is* Gloria Steinem, guru-ess
to oppressed ivory tower females and such.
 
Kind-hearted  Sherman Skolnick, however, apparently differs as to
a nefarious underground pushing a  secret agenda with the help of
well-intentioned feminist dupes.  When I met with him and  Joseph
Andreuccetti  in  April  of  1995, I broached the likelihood of a
feminist  conspiracy  operating   within  the  womyn's  movement.
Skolnick didn't think so.  However  Andreuccetti  said,  yes,  it
seemed  likely  that  the  womyn's movement *would* be an obvious
place to look for the machinations of a secret society.
 
So  why is it that the feminist movement is highly favored by the
mass media?  It is almost a  given that anything so supported and
propagandized by the establishment press  *must*  be  in  cahoots
with  the dominant classes.  Corporate America's public relations
shill, the mass media, makes  it  obvious  who is who by negative
distortions of  some  groups  (conspiratologists,  for  instance)
versus  positive  slants on others.  In the case of feminists and
the constituent bloc they loudly claim to speak for, the slant is
so extreme it is grotesque:   the  evil male in one corner versus
"sugar and spice" in the other.  Thank goodness there are  plenty
of  tough  cops  in  television  land  to  save these "damsels in
distress"!
 
According  to  an  item  in  the  July  8,  1996 issue of the New
Federalist newspaper, current earnings  of  U.S. workers buy half
of what they used to.  Says New Federalist, "...workers now  have
less  than  50  percent  of  the  buying  power  they  had in the
mid-1960s."  By a strange "coincidence", the two-income household
has become increasingly common since  that time.  As buying power
got cut in half, wives began to leave their  homemaker  jobs  for
outside   employment.    This  societal  phenomena  was  sold  as
"liberation of  women  from  household  drudgery."   But what was
really going on was that women, *from* *dire*  *necessity*,  were
forced to seek extra income for their families.
 
Or,  maybe  it  worked  the other way around:  women increasingly
decided to  work  outside  the  home,  that  in  turn doubled the
available labor pool,  and  wages  consequently  declined.   It's
supply  and  demand:   if  the  available  supply  of  workers is
doubled, the price of labor goes down -- in this case it has been
effectively cut in half.
 
But what to do  with  idle  labor, now increasingly frustrated in
its search for fair wages and worthwhile employment?   All  those
idle  workers  hanging  around could spell trouble for the ruling
class.   Due  to  strong  anti-war  sentiment,  the  younger male
population can't just be thrown away as cannon fodder, for "noble
causes", like in the old days.
 
What can be done?  Criminalize them:  get "tough on crime";  lock
them away.  Disarm them.  Turn them into dopers.  Give them AIDS.
Feed them cultural crapola via mass media that keeps them stupid.
Demoralize  them  with "Big Lie" techniques, such as telling them
"the economy is good."
 
Then, when the men are mostly ground down, the all-powerful State
can turn its  attention  to  the  now  less-protected women.  You
thought your old man was bad news?  Find out why Nietzche  called
the State, "the coldest of all cold monsters."
