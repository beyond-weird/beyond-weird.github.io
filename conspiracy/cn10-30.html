ENERGY GRATUITIES SUPPLIED TO CONSPIRACY NATION
===============================================
 
How many  times  I  have  been  discouraged.   That  'ol Debil he
whisper in my ear: "Why bother? Who reads it anyway?"
 
But at such times, I have  been  assisted  by  the  kind  federal
agents who monitor this series.  "At least they're reading it," I
would  reassure myself.  So thanks, guys and girls, you've helped
keep me going.
 
At other low  down  and  discouraged times, thoughtful, anonymous
persons have lent a hand.  Like  my  daily  "ghost  caller,"  for
instance.   Through  thick  and thin I can rely on "the ghost" to
ring me every day and  then  hang  up when I answer.  Lately "the
ghost" has been especially  kind.   Perhaps  noting  a  dwindling
number  of  articles, he or she has lately boosted efforts by now
doing the "ghost call" routine  several times a day.  "The ghost"
must have tuned in to my discouragement and boosted  his  efforts
in my behalf.  Thanks, "ghost," for the free energy.
 
Today, weighed down by that old  hopeless  feeling,  yet  another
kind   reader  lent  a  hand.   "Federal  witnesses,"  "FBI,"  he
struggled-for-calm yet had to  inform  me via telephone.  "Have a
nice weekend; we'll know by Monday," were his last  words  before
hanging up.  More free energy.  Thanks.
 
Maybe FBI itself will be contacting me next, all about a story in
Conspiracy  Nation.  I dare not hope too much for such a donation
of energy to the cause, but who knows? I'm lucky.
