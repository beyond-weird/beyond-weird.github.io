ROYAL GALA FOR CLINTONS: POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE
==============================================
 
So  much money, lavishly displayed, awes the lesser classes.  The
King must  be  mighty  to  throw  around  riches  in  such a way.
Selfless "corporate citizens" demand not so much  as  a  logo  on
display  in  return  for  their  generosity.  But why not, say, a
tasteful Golden Arches discretely placed at the inauguration?
 
All lesser citizens of the realm view with envy the happiness and
nirvana evident on the face  of  Lady  Hillary, as she (the lucky
devil) gets to  sit  through  the  lengthy  pre-inaugural  church
service.  Later, it's a flurry of festivities, with Lord and Lady
Clinton  out partying until quite late.  Such wonderful times are
not granted to most,  and  Bill  and  Hillary act in a convincing
manner, implying that they are enjoying it all.
 
In   the   previous  issue  of  Conspiracy  Nation  was  reported
allegations that  "During  the  1996  presidential  campaign, the
Bronfman family and their Seagrams liquor empire were the largest
contributors to  both  the  Republican  and  Democratic  National
Committees."  An article in the Feb. 3, 1997 "New Republic" shows
how  other  "corporate  citizens,"  for some reason, are happy to
give away money.  In case some of them "backed the  wrong  horse"
in  the  presidential  race,  they can make amends by funding the
inaugural display.  The article  in  "New Republic" even suggests
that the inaugural venue subjects contributors to  less  scrutiny
than   pre-election   contributions.    "If   anything,   today's
inaugurals  actually  exceed campaigns in the corruption to which
they give rise.  During  a presidential campaign, the expectation
that a donation will bring  a  desired  policy  outcome  is  more
uncertain.   After  all,  the favored candidate may not even win.
But inaugural contributions are  certain  to  go to someone whose
gratitude will matter.  And they  also  allow  corporations  that
have  backed a president's opponent a last chance to make amends,
as prominent  GOP  supporter  Dwayne  Andreas  of  Archer Daniels
Midland did when he donated $100,000 to Bill Clinton's  inaugural
in 1993."
 
Wasn't  that  nice  of  Dwayne  Andreas  to donate that $100,000?
Isn't it nice of  Archer  Daniels  Midland to financially support
the Jim Lehrer  Newshour  on  PBS?   Maybe,  since  they  are  so
generous, they will even send me some money!
 
Wasn't that gracious of the Clintons to accept that $100,000 from
Dwayne  Andreas?   I  could  also  accept  $100,000  from  Dwayne
Andreas,  since  I  also am gracious.  But come to think of it, I
would have an ethical problem accepting the money.  (Not meant to
suggest  that  Conspiracy  Nation  is  more  ethical  than   U.S.
President Bill Clinton.)
 
Apparently  not  much  information  is available at this point on
corporate  largesse  and  the   1997  inaugural.   For  the  1993
inaugural,  other  generous  contributors  were  Federal  Express
($100,000), Salomon Brothers ($50,000), AFL-CIO ($200,000).  U.S.
Air donated $200,000 worth of free plane tickets.  Motorola  made
$1.5   million   in  cell  phones,  pagers,  and  two-way  radios
available.  Korbel champagne gave  $50,000 worth of "the bubbly."
Ford,  Chrysler,   and   General   Motors   offered   500   cars.
Anheuser-Busch provided free beer.
 
But  shouldn't  the stockholders be furious that so much money is
being thrown away like this?
